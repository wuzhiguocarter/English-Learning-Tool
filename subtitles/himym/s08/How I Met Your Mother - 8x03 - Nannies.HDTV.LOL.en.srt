NARRATOR: <i>Kids, October of 2012</i>
<i>kicked off</i>

2
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:06,126
<i>The Autumn of Breakups.</i>

3
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:08,929
<i>And Barney, having broken</i>
<i>his engagement with Quinn,</i>

4
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:11,715
<i>was slowly trying</i>
<i>to pick himself back up.</i>

5
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:15,685
Welcome to Bangtoberfest!

6
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:17,888
Have a Bangtoberfest T-shirt!

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,189
I'm back!

8
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:20,690
Have a Bangtoberfest
T-shirt!

9
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,726
I'm single again!

10
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:23,894
(woman screams)

11
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:25,062
Sorry about your eye!

12
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:26,113
I'm available!

13
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:27,064
(clicks tongue)

14
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,949
"Bangtoberfest:

15
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:31,535
This Time It's Really
Not Personal."

16
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,320
Barney, you just
went through

17
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:35,188
some really big emotional stuff.

18
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,207
You need to give yourself
some time to heal.

19
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,910
Robin, I spent
seven grand on merch.

20
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:41,545
This is happening.

21
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:44,998
Hey.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,366
Hey.
Hi, Marshall.

23
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,585
So, Lily's dad just showed up

24
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:51,071
two days ago unannounced.

25
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,389
Remember when I
bought all those

26
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,623
Mexican fireworks so I'd never

27
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,058
have to buy
Christmas presents again?

28
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,210
Oh, God, you blew
up the house.

29
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:58,979
(laughing):
Blew up the house?

30
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:00,147
Oh, no.

31
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,381
Nothing like that, no.

32
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,599
(laughs)

33
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,317
No, the fireworks
blew up the garage.

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,619
The house burned down.

35
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:07,237
Holy frijoles,

36
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,405
do I smell brownies?

37
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:10,223
(grunting)

38
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:12,058
We covered that fire
on the news.

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,029
I had no idea "naked man
runs back into inferno

40
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:18,448
to rescue potato salad"
was Mickey.

41
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:21,334
My hour's up.
Your turn, Marshall.

42
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:23,420
Oh, no.

43
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:26,256
Baby Marvin,
did you just go poo-poo?

44
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:27,724
Craziest thing.

45
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:29,893
He just went poo-poo
this very second.

46
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:31,411
MARSHALL:
Are you sure this

47
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,463
poo-poo didn't happen
on your watch

48
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,999
and you just ran out the clock
until it was my problem?

49
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,934
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

50
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:41,555
What kind of mother lets her son
sit in his own filth

51
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:44,291
for an extra nine minutes
and 42 seconds?

52
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:52,482
I got my eye on you, Aldrin.

53
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:57,103
It's watering right now,
but I got my eye on you.

54
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,273
LILY: I can't
believe I have to go

55
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:03,126
back to work on Monday and
we still haven't found a nanny.

56
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,962
Well, if Grandpa Mickey's there,
couldn't he just...

57
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,380
(chuckles):
Are you kidding?

58
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:09,883
My dad was never there for me
when I was a kid.

59
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,284
And when he was...

60
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:13,086
(sighs)

61
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,671
What's wrong, Daddy?

62
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:18,625
Oh, Daddy can't pick a horse
to save his freakin' life.

63
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:22,312
All I need is
just one lucky number.

64
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:23,980
Hey, when's your birthday?

65
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:26,816
Today.

66
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:29,135
Well...

67
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:32,138
We've got to find a nanny,
and my dad's definitely not it.

68
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,141
Well, um, and this doesn't
solve your nanny problem,

69
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,327
but if you're in need
of a babysitter,

70
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,612
Nick and I could do it.

71
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:41,364
We're really clicking
as a couple.

72
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:44,701
Um, if any couple
is clicking these days,

73
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:46,253
it's me and Victoria.

74
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:47,671
(laughs)

75
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:50,323
Do you think
that you and Victoria

76
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:52,542
are clicking more than
me and Nick?

77
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,427
Do you think you and Nick are...
(gasps)

78
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:56,596
Oh, that's precious.

79
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,716
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, when you're in</i>
<i>a new relationship</i>

80
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:02,252
<i>and you're competing with</i>
<i>your ex for who's happier,</i>

81
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:03,503
<i>it can get ugly.</i>

82
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:06,273
Anyway, I should get going.

83
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,892
I have to go get
a key made for Nick.

84
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:10,527
For my apartment.

85
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:11,728
Ha-burn.

86
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,446
Hey, maybe the locksmith
who made the key

87
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,365
I gave to Victoria
will give you a deal.

88
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,650
Oh, wait, he won't remember me.

89
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:17,784
It was three weeks ago.

90
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:18,985
Ha-double burn.

91
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,520
Nick signed for a package
when I wasn't there.

92
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:22,205
Victoria keeps tampons
at my apartment.

93
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,199
Damn it!

NARRATOR: <i>The next day,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall's</i>

97
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:40,724
<i>nanny search hit pay dirt.</i>

98
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:42,759
(British accent):
Mr. and Mrs. Eriksen,

99
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:46,563
I promise to create a safe,
nurturing environment

100
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:49,733
full of learning,
laughter and love.

101
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:51,101
So that even when

102
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:52,686
we have to eat lima beans

103
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,571
or we get a boo-boo on our knee,

104
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:57,890
we know everything
will be just fine.

105
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,659
And do you know why?

106
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,227
Because you're an angel
sent from heaven?

107
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,663
I want to bury my head
in the safety of your bosom.

108
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:06,249
Because Mrs. Buckminster
is here.

109
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:07,233
(Lily sighs)

110
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,068
The search is over.

111
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,455
Mrs. Buckminster, we just
need to know your salary.

112
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:14,240
Oh, delightful!

113
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,876
Well, my weekly fee is...

114
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:18,011
(Marshall and Lily sobbing)

115
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,412
There, there.

116
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:23,350
I'm sure you'll find someone
you like just as much.

117
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:24,351
No, we won't!

118
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:25,935
Not like you!

119
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,773
Hey, Robin,
can I borrow a stamp?

120
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:33,426
Oh, wait, this wedding
reply card already has one.

121
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:34,778
Why, you ask?

122
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,281
Victoria and I
are RSVPing to a wedding...

123
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:39,733
in Jamaica...

124
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:41,284
six months from now.

125
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,652
Ha-triple burn.

126
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:44,371
Oh.

127
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:45,288
Jamaica.

128
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,573
Yeah.

129
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:47,741
That's an island, right?

130
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,443
Depends where you're going
with this.

131
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,046
All the way
to the island of Hawaii.

132
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:54,381
Why, you ask?

133
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:55,498
Well, I was invited

134
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,783
to spend New Year's there...

135
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,135
last night when I met
Nick's parents.

136
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,954
Ha-aloha burn.

137
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:02,455
Have you, um,

138
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,724
met Victoria's parents, Ted?

139
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:08,395
As a matter of fact, I haven't.

140
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,513
Because they're dead.

141
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:13,266
Are they, Ted?

142
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:14,901
Are they really dead?

143
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:17,070
No.

144
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,188
Damn it!

145
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,825
Bangtoberfest is a flop!

146
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:25,195
I can't think of an
innovative way to bang chicks

147
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:27,697
that properly honors
my return to the game.

148
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,149
Sure, I've tried
some old reliables.

149
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:31,835
(Boston accent):
Ten unpaid parking tickets?

150
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:37,507
I suppose there is one way
I could... "get you off."

151
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:40,927
(normal voice):
No!

152
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:44,330
I've used that admittedly
awesome line a thousand times.

153
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,349
(Boston accent):
You're better than this, Barney!

154
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,469
(deep voice): Well, the evidence
is pretty incriminating, but...

155
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:54,107
I suppose there is one way
I could "get you off."

156
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,976
(normal voice):
Damn it! What?

157
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:59,229
Bangtoberfest is
about innovation,

158
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,947
about ideas.

159
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,516
Bangtoberfest used to
mean something.

160
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,851
You just
made it up yesterday.

161
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:05,952
Enough questions.

162
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,037
I need time
to think!

163
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,958
So, how's the nanny search
going, Lil?

164
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,159
Lousy.

165
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,062
Mrs. Buckminster
was a spoonful of sugar.

166
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,932
But so far, everyone we can
afford on this Web site

167
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:22,852
HeyNannyNanny.com
is Scary Poppins.

168
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:24,771
NARRATOR: <i>But Lily and Marshall</i>
<i>needed a nanny,</i>

169
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:27,140
<i>so they forged ahead</i>
<i>with their search.</i>

170
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:29,709
So, zero experience
as a nanny?

171
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:32,879
Right. But in rehab,
I was in charge of the cats.

172
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,665
And only two died,
so I figured...

173
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,800
(coughs):
I'm available.

174
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,268
(clears throat)

175
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,236
How do you feel
about spanking?

176
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:44,040
For eight bucks an hour, you can
do whatever you want to me.

177
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,325
(coughs):
I'm available.

178
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,693
Dad, we know.

179
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:49,245
(coughs):
I wasn't talking to you.

180
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:52,115
NARRATOR: <i>Finally,</i>
<i>they met Julie Jorgensen.</i>

181
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:55,568
You're from
St. Cloud, Minnesota?

182
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,786
I'm from St. Cloud.

183
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:59,172
Really? Oh, you must know
my dad, George Jorgensen?

184
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,173
Of course.

185
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,407
George Jorgensen's Organs.

186
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:02,909
Last year, my brother
joined the business.

187
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,462
Really? Who knew that Morgan
Jorgensen would go into organs?

188
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:06,579
Anyway, Julie...

189
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,264
Is it still called
George Jorgensen's Organs

190
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,767
or did they change it to
George Jorgensen and Son Organs?

191
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,386
They changed it to George
and Morgan Jorgensen's Organs.

192
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,921
Guess whose idea that was?

193
00:07:14,923 --> 00:07:16,856
Morgan's.
Morgan's.

194
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,424
They just opened a new shop
out of state.

195
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:19,809
Oh, yeah? Where?
Oregon.

196
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:20,693
What's that one called?

197
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:22,495
Piano Town.

198
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:25,448
Well, you have
experience,

199
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,618
and I think it's safe to say
you have my husband's approval.

200
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,153
What's your salary?

201
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:31,988
Oh, um, it's right there.

202
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:36,609
Julie, we would love
for you to be our nanny.

203
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,161
Oh, thank you so much.

204
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,279
Um, I just have
one last interview today,

205
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,948
but to be honest,
I can't imagine

206
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,716
liking anyone more
than I like you guys.

207
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,134
Oh...

208
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:46,169
Okay, bye.

209
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,170
Bye.

210
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,788
LILY:
Yay.

211
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,392
Well, she was a total bitch.

212
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,179
NARRATOR: <i>That night,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall called Julie</i>

213
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,897
<i>hoping she'd accept the job.</i>

214
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,149
I'm so sorry, I can't.

215
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,769
Don't tell us
you took the other job.

216
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,971
No, I didn't.
I'm not taking any nanny job.

217
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:06,990
I don't understand.

218
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,107
The most amazing thing happened

219
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,976
at my next interview
after you guys.

220
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,911
I fell in love with a single dad

221
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:13,947
who turns out to be
a billionaire.

222
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:16,783
Tomorrow, we're heading off
to Paris in his private jet.

223
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:20,670
It's gonna be, as he would say,
legend-- wait for it...

224
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:23,339
BOTH:
Barney!

225
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:26,659
Ix-nay on the eal-ray ame-nay.

226
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,177
Mr. and Mrs. Eriksen?

227
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:31,681
You son of a...

228
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,349
itch-bay!

229
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:41,166
Look, Barney's our friend,
for some reason,

230
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:43,650
and everything he
told you was a lie.

231
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,235
But the good news is

232
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,270
you're free to
come work for us.

233
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:49,489
I'm sorry, I can't
nanny for anyone

234
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,658
who's friends with this monster.

235
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,497
(door closes)

236
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,049
Look, I'd offer you guys coffee,

237
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,567
but I have
another nanny interview

238
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:02,919
in about 15 minutes, so...

239
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:05,221
Barney, quick question: why are
you interviewing nannies?

240
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:06,306
Glad you asked!

241
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:08,291
You guys were all
pressuring me to think of

242
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:10,677
a revolutionary new way
to get chicks for Bangtoberfest.

243
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,795
And frankly, I was stumped.

244
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:14,230
Until...

245
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:16,766
So far, everyone we can
afford on this Web site

246
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:20,103
HeyNannyNanny.com
is Scary Poppins.

247
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:21,804
BARNEY:
<i>And there it was.</i>

248
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:25,275
<i>The Big Bro in the sky</i>
<i>had answered my prayers.</i>

249
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:26,976
Almighty-five.

250
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:28,161
Ow.

251
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,313
I'd introduce you
to little Baby Edgar,

252
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,832
(whispering):
but one, he's napping,

253
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:36,202
and two, he doesn't exist.

254
00:09:36,204 --> 00:09:39,005
And these nannies are
really falling for this?

255
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:42,008
Yeah, these toys don't even
make sense for a baby.

256
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,095
You've got an air rifle,
you got the exact race track

257
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:47,147
with the double loopty-loop
I had as a kid!

258
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,884
Oh, can I open it, can I
open it, can I open it?

259
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,802
What about Baby Edgar's mom?

260
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:56,022
Oh, that's a sad story.

261
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:59,175
And in the end, the
coroner's report confirmed

262
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:00,977
what I already feared:

263
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:06,533
the female body cannot withstand
that many consecutive orgasms.

264
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:11,054
I blame myself.

265
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,873
Okay, does anybody have
six nine-volt batteries?

266
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,629
Once I got the nannies
all sympathetic,

267
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:22,215
I had to check
their qualifications.

268
00:10:22,217 --> 00:10:24,234
I'd like to see how
you handle bath time.

269
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:26,686
Follow me
to the tub.

270
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:28,054
Should I get the baby?

271
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:30,206
No.

272
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,225
I'm just gonna take
the batteries

273
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:34,544
out of these smoke detectors.
Cool? Cool.

274
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:40,433
Once the interview was over,
I went in for the kill.

275
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,352
You're perfect for the job.

276
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:44,854
So, congratulations,
you're hi...

277
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:46,022
No.

278
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,741
I can't do this.

279
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,393
I find you very attractive,

280
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:52,579
and it wouldn't be
appropriate.

281
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,034
It wouldn't be
appropriate.

282
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:03,757
It wouldn't be appropriate.

283
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:09,129
I repeat--
it would not be appropriate.

284
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:17,137
It was like taking candy
from an imaginary baby!

285
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,606
Barney, I just went five months
with no help,

286
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:22,942
and interviewed 92 nannies
before finding one we liked,

287
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,360
and you ruined everything

288
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:27,030
the night before
I'm supposed to go back to work?

289
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:29,866
Thank you for being
the most immature person

290
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,284
I have ever met.

291
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:32,485
Marshall, let's go.

292
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:33,503
Five more minutes!

293
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:36,072
Now.

294
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:37,807
I'll be right back.
Okay.

295
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,227
Mm.
Mmm.

296
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:42,445
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

297
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:43,913
(moaning)
(laughs)

298
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:45,715
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

299
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:47,801
(chuckles)
Mmm!

300
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,836
I'll miss you.
(laughs)

301
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:53,973
Oh! Oh!

302
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:55,859
(laughs)

303
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,494
Overcompensating a bit?

304
00:11:57,496 --> 00:12:00,513
Why would I <i>need</i>
to overcompensate?

305
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,432
I am... (sighs)

306
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:05,301
...deliriously happy
in my perfect relationship.

307
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:09,405
What about what I just witnessed
not two minutes ago?

308
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:12,492
How can the Giants
pass on third and one?!

309
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:14,310
Honey, it's okay.

310
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:16,880
It's the first quarter, and the
Browns are only up by three...

311
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:18,832
Robin, I don't want
you to fix this.

312
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:23,503
I just want
to feel heard.

313
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,455
First of all,
the Giants were smart

314
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:27,790
not to run
on my Dawg Pound defense.

315
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:28,825
They suck, Ted.
I know.

316
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,460
And two--

317
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:33,229
there is no way
that you like being with a guy

318
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:34,631
who's so emotional and needy.

319
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,883
(scoffs)
You want to dance, Mosby?

320
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:39,219
Let's talk about yesterday.

321
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,605
Hi! You guys,
I'm so sorry I'm so late.

322
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:45,391
I'm gonna run upstairs,
change, I'll be back

323
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:47,694
in five minutes.

324
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,979
Take your time, sweetie.

325
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,384
Victoria's a slob!

326
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,452
Well, at least
I'm not dating a girl.

327
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,187
You know what I mean.

328
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,305
Hey, you know what?

329
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:01,491
I-I really appreciate
how sensitive

330
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,494
and in touch he is with his...

331
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,028
God, who am I kidding?

332
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,866
20 bucks says he is crying
in the ladies' room right now.

333
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:13,503
Well, at least when
he's finished, he's gonna flush.

334
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:15,872
(sighs)

335
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:18,591
NARRATOR: <i>So, just as Lily was about</i>
<i>to call in sick</i>

336
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,426
<i>on her first day</i>
<i>back to work...</i>

337
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,595
(phone beeps, knocking on door)

338
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,984
Good morning!

339
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:31,321
Mrs. Buckminster, hold me
and make everything okay!

340
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:35,108
I mean, uh... what
are you doing here?

341
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,562
A Mr. Stinson called the agency
and offered to pay my salary.

342
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,916
Wow. Really?

343
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:45,535
It's a nice gesture,
but I'm still pissed.

344
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:48,070
He also sent along this.

345
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,006
Are the batteries...?

346
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,176
Yes, the batteries
are included, dear.

347
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,378
Yes!

348
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,597
Now, off to
work, you two.

349
00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:00,516
Mr. Marvin and I are going
to get acquainted.

350
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:02,135
Great.

351
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,937
I can't wait to hand him off

352
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:05,638
and-and finally get
some freedom.

353
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,141
You deserve it.
Now hand him over.

354
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:11,027
Hand him over, yup.

355
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,147
I'll just take little Marvin
off your hands then.

356
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,115
Take him off my hands.

357
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:18,151
There he goes.

358
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,954
Ready to receive him!

359
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:23,623
I can't give Marvin
to a stranger!

360
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:27,543
(toy car whirring)

361
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,079
Okay, somebody who's not
in the middle of a race

362
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,632
should probably go talk to her.

363
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,732
I'm sorry Mrs. Buckminster

364
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,405
we've decided we're not going
to use a nanny afterall.

365
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,421
You're fired.

366
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,813
Calm down.

367
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,091
Lily, you're just
nervous about spending

368
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,864
your first day away from Marvin.

369
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,609
That's perfectly normal.

370
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,169
Oh, I am holding
on to you forever.

371
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,937
And when I die and
I become a skeleton

372
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:54,738
I'll still be holding you.
Yes.

373
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,915
Last night, Nick cried
when I killed a spider.

374
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,902
You should have brought
that spider over to my house

375
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,808
to feast on the ant colony

376
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,961
breeding on Victoria's
unwashed dishes.

377
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:11,630
Whoa!
(gasping)

378
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,015
Barney, what
happened to you?

379
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:16,551
It was a nightmare.

380
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:18,670
<i>I'm walking down the street,</i>
<i>minding my own business,</i>

381
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,105
<i>and I see one of the nannies</i>

382
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,006
<i>that I interviewed,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking,</i>

383
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,192
<i>"Maybe I can get her</i>
<i>behind a Dumpster</i>

384
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:25,861
<i>and interview her again."</i>

385
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,363
<i>But then...</i>

386
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,983
<i>And then...</i>

387
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:33,518
<i>They were everywhere.</i>

388
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,238
<i>I was surrounded!</i>

389
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,989
Hey. Hi.

390
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,458
Did you

391
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,359
really think
you could get away with this?

392
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,461
(laughs)

393
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,330
As a matter of fact,
I did, yeah.

394
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:47,449
Time for your nap!

395
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,836
I woke up in a Dumpster

396
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:52,838
covered in diapers.

397
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,756
And I found a pacifier

398
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,392
somewhere I'm not
willing to discuss.

399
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,062
What is wrong with me?!

400
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,213
You're still
getting over Quinn.

401
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:05,150
You can't just dive right back
into single Barney mode.

402
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:06,651
But I can't stop myself!

403
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:07,903
I'm out of control!

404
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,388
No, I'm not. I'm fine!

405
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,555
Now,

406
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:11,823
if you'll excuse me,

407
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:16,078
that blonde at the bar looks
as loose as my rear molars.

408
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,280
Stop me! Don't stop me!
I'm fine. Help!

409
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:20,499
Being single's great!

410
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:26,922
You know, Victoria's messiness

411
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:30,675
just forces me
to grow as a cleaner.

412
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:33,178
Totally. And without Nick,

413
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,963
who's gonna hem my pants?

414
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,682
To making
these relationships last.

415
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:42,253
NARRATOR: <i>Both relationships</i>
<i>would implode within the month.</i>

416
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:43,889
Hey, sweetie.

417
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,391
Hey. Did you guys conk out?

418
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,477
Yeah, I guess we did.

419
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,611
What time is it?

420
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:50,562
5:00.

421
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:53,064
Wow. We slept all day!

422
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,317
Quick question. Um,

423
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,234
where's Marvin?

424
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,420
Right here.

425
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:02,741
(screaming)

426
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:09,164
(screaming)

427
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:13,051
Hey, gang.
What's the big whoop?

428
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:14,252
Marvin!

429
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,720
Dad, what happened?

430
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,840
MICKEY: <i>Well, when I came back</i>
<i>this morning from my jog,</i>

431
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,225
<i>Marshall was gone,</i>

432
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:22,761
<i>and I couldn't find</i>
<i>Mrs.</i> <i>What's-her-face.</i>

433
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:27,983
<i>And you two were sawing logs,</i>
<i>so I figured I'd lend a hand.</i>

434
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,477
LILY:
<i>Then, why did I wake up</i>

435
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,163
holding a monkey?

436
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,532
Well, a little later,
I got kind of hungry.

437
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:54,342
So I gave him a bath, and put
his diaper rash ointment on,

438
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,194
and fed him strained peas,
not bananas,

439
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:58,013
'cause he had bananas yesterday,

440
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,231
and I did the laundry,

441
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,132
finished my burrito,

442
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:02,934
put him down
for his nap at noon,

443
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,387
sterilized the bottles, and then
we just went to the park.

444
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:06,888
Okay.

445
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,841
Wow. That's incredible.

446
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,893
When did you get so good
with kids?

447
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,912
You know something, honey,
you don't remember this,

448
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,431
but, um, for the first few years
of your life,

449
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,367
your mom worked,
and I was a stay-at-home dad.

450
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,553
I thought Grandma and Grandpa
took care of me.

451
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:22,654
Well, they visited a lot,

452
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:24,840
but I was the guy
who took care of you.

453
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,591
You know, America thinks

454
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:29,077
I ran into that burning house
to get potato salad,

455
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,630
but I actually ran in
to get this photo album.

456
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:34,549
And potato salad. Sure.

457
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:47,078
Dad, I never
realized you were...

458
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,232
there for me.

459
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:53,618
How come there are no pictures
of me after I go to preschool?

460
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,588
Well...

461
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,474
Oh. Okay, well,

462
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:02,694
have fun on your first day
of preschool, Princess.

463
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:05,013
Okay. Off you go.

464
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,182
There you go.

465
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,117
Ugh!

466
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,037
How am I gonna make it
to 3:00 without her?

467
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:15,640
(sighs)

468
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:18,727
"Belmont Race Track?" Hmm.

469
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,429
I guess it couldn't hurt
to go just once.

470
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:24,766
Six months later,

471
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:27,302
guess what gambling addict's
thumbs had metal pins in them?

472
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:28,470
(tongue clicking)

473
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,189
This guy.

474
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:34,893
Look, honey, I was a jerk

475
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,028
who wasn't there
for most of your childhood,

476
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,231
and I regret that
every single day of my life.

477
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,534
But I promise you,

478
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:45,403
I'm here now for Marvin...

479
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,572
if you want.

480
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,542

Ten parking tickets, huh?

490
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,646
I suppose there is a way
I could, uh...

491
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:23,548
"get you off."

492
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,117
(normal voice):
Why did I ever doubt a classic?

493
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,036
MRS. BUCKMINSTER:
Now, now, now.

494
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:30,772
This is exactly the
sort of behavior

495
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:33,274
you hired me to put an end to,
Mr. Stinson.

496
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,076
Off with you, dear.

497
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:36,828
Go make better decisions!

498
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,000
You're right.

499
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:44,168
Thanks, Mrs. Buckminster.

500
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,370
You're welcome.

501
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,839
And I'm proud of you
for trying to change.

502
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:49,851
What you're doing

503
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,969
with these <i>young</i> women

504
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:54,305
is simply not appropriate.

505
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,571
That can never
happen again.

506
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,480
Oh, pish-posh. You said that
five times ago.
