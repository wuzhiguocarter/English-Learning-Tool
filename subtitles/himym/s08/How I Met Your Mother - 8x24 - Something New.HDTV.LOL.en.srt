1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,303
Kids, in the spring of 2030,

2
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,154
we were all tying up loose ends
before the big wedding.

3
00:00:07,263 --> 00:00:08,929
<i>I was right here</i>
<i>in this very room,</i>

4
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:10,681
<i>putting the finishing touches</i>
<i>on the house.</i>

5
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:17,771
Oh, come on!

6
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:20,074
<i>Barney and Robin</i>
<i>were wrapping up rehearsal</i>

7
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:21,008
<i>for their first dance.</i>

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,444
That was amazing.
We can do better.

9
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:24,644
Back to one, everyone!

10
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:28,015
Reload the cannons,
we'll go again right away.

11
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:31,502
<i>And Lily and Marshall</i>
<i>were packing</i>

12
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:33,754
<i>for their year in Italy.</i>

13
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:36,924
Hello.

14
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:38,842
How's my favorite
daughter-in-law?

15
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:39,877
Oh, things are

16
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:41,044
a bit crazy here.

17
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:43,013
We've got this big move to Rome
coming up,

18
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:44,715
and I, I just can't shake
the feeling

19
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:46,967
that I'm forgetting something,
you know.

20
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,520
I know, I know,
I'm being crazy, right?

21
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:51,271
Right, Judy?

22
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:52,356
Right,
Judy?

23
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:55,109
You're moving to Rome?!

24
00:00:55,944 --> 00:00:57,010
Is that my mom?

25
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:59,646
Don't mention Rome.

28
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,807
You didn't tell
your mom about Rome?

29
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,617
It didn't feel right.

30
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,168
This isn't
over-the-phone news.

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,586
This is face-to-face news.

32
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:23,288
I was gonna tell her
when we see her at Christmas.

33
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,673
You were gonna wait and tell her

34
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:27,176
after we had already been living
there for six months?

35
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:29,962
That... was a great plan.

36
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,096
Damn it.

37
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,800
Hey, Mom, it's Marshall.

38
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,268
If you're moving to Rome,

39
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,472
I at least need to see
my grandson before you go!

40
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:42,891
Of course, and that is why
we would love

41
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,144
for you to come visit us
for a week.

42
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,196
No.

43
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:48,897
The place will be all packed up.

44
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,683
Oh, oh, uh, okay, hey, Mom,
better idea:

45
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:54,069
how about we all come visit you
for a week?

46
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:55,788
I can't go to Minnesota
for a week.

47
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,873
I have a job.

48
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,526
Okay, Mom, here's the plan:
um, Lily has to work,

49
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:04,029
so Marvin and I will come visit
you for a whole week,

50
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,951
and I-I'll see if I can
get a last-minute flight.

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,385
You are going to take
my infant son

52
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:12,671
away from me for a whole week?

53
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:15,674
Whoo!

54
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,860
So, what do you want
to do tonight--

55
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:20,262
drink ourselves blind,
set a car on fire?

56
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,815
Ooh, watch a movie
that doesn't start

57
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:25,684
with a desk lamp jumping
on top of a capital "I"?

58
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:27,936
I'm all yours, Teddy Westside.

59
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:30,522
Actually, tonight
it's Teddy Westchester.

60
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:32,741
Got to head up to the house,
take care of some stuff.

61
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:35,110
Oh, yeah,
how's the restoration going?

62
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:37,779
Actually, done.

63
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,831
You finished the house?

64
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,616
Well, I want to see it.

65
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,167
Marshall already canceled
the cable, huh?

66
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:43,585
And the Wi-Fi.
It's like <i>Little House</i>

67
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:44,903
<i>on the Freaking Prairie</i>
up there.

68
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:46,121
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:50,175
Well, the wedding
planning is done,

70
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:53,846
so tonight is all about relaxing
and celebrating

71
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:55,848
everything that makes us
awesome,

72
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,748
which is why

73
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,967
I requested our favorite table.

74
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,019
The one by the window.

75
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:04,439
Where we were sitting the night
we saw those two bums fighting.

76
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,191
Over a sandwich.

77
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:10,229
We almost called the cops.

78
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,648
And then we realized
they weren't fighting at all.

79
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,032
They were making love.

80
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,535
Over a sandwich.

81
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,871
Oh, I almost forgot.

82
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:21,456
Ha-ha, yeah.
No way, is that...?

83
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,659
El Piramide.

84
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,245
The first cigar
we ever smoked together.

85
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,913
Aw, Barney.

86
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:30,382
Excuse me.

87
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:31,449
Hi.

88
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,018
Could you not?
Thanks.

89
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,136
Uh...

90
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:35,504
dude, I'm not gonna
light 'em up in here.

91
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,289
I'm just looking
at 'em.

92
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,258
Right, but even
when they're unlit,

93
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,626
the smell-- it's very...

94
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:42,511
Pungent.

95
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,563
Exactly--
thank you.

96
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:47,983
It's a very pungent smell.

97
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,402
So, could you not?

98
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,603
Thanks.

99
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:55,274
Okay.

100
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:02,030
I'm sorry, can you also
put the bag away?

101
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:07,085
It-It's just really
unappetizing to look at.

102
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:08,620
You're unappetizing to look at.

103
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,156
You know what?
Um, I'll put them away, okay?

104
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,291
Enjoy your night.

105
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,710
We'll try.

106
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:17,996
Did those two just become
our archenemies?

107
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:19,298
No, Robin, they've
always been

108
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,349
our archenemies.

109
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,769
They've only just
revealed themselves.

110
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:24,937
Hi, Kristen?

111
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,888
Everyone pronounces it wrong.

112
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,141
The "R" is
after the "I""

113
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,058
Kirsten.

114
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,643
And before the "I""

115
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,563
It's Krirsten.

116
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,098
Your table's ready.

117
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,619
Wow, they're "trerrible""

118
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:41,570
You know what?

119
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,205
Don't even think
about them, okay?

120
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,540
Tonight is about celebrating us.
You're right, you're right.

121
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,243
- We shouldn't let a couple...
- Nope, nope.

122
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,828
I'm a self-diagnosed
claustrophobic.

123
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,047
I have to sit
next to the window.

124
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:53,799
No, that's our table,
that's our table,

125
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,667
that's our table, that's our table,
that's our table,

126
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,169
that's our table.

127
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,472
You know what?

128
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,391
Screw celebrating us.
You know what we're gonna do?

129
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:05,543
Make those smug,
obnoxious sons of bitches pay.

130
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:06,878
Aw...

131
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:11,149
<i>So Aunt Lily and I drove up</i>
<i>to Westchester.</i>

132
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,552
Hey, baby,

133
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:15,437
how's Minnesota?

134
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,155
It is so much fun.

135
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,440
Oh, hold on one sec.

136
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:21,576
Marshall, I made you this
welcome-home ice cream sundae.

137
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:24,112
But I can't remember,
do you like crushed nuts?

138
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,230
I love

139
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:26,448
crushed nuts.

140
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh!

141
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:32,437
Anyway, it's,
it's great to be home.

142
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,789
How's Judy doing?

143
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,873
Oh, she's great.

144
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,041
It's cute, you know,
she keeps joking

145
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,909
about how she's not
gonna let us leave.

146
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:39,411
I'm really not.

147
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:40,912
It's not a joke.

148
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,969
Judy's going to talk him
out of going to Rome.

149
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,355
I knew something was going
to screw up our plans,

150
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:51,690
and this is it.

151
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:54,059
She is going to convince him
never to leave the country.

152
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,944
I think
you're imagining things.

153
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:59,197
Oh, yeah? Well, check out
what's already on Facebook.

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,932
Inconclusive.

155
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:02,868
Oh, really?

156
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:05,987
It's getting
conclusiver.

157
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:06,938
Hey, Lily.

158
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,241
What?
Come on.

159
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,127
Okay, open 'em.

160
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,746
Your eyes-- sorry,
they should have been closed.

161
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:15,747
That one's on me.

162
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:16,748
Let's try again.

163
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,782
Wow.

164
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:21,136
Ted, you did this
all yourself?

165
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:24,306
Just like Ryan Gosling
in <i>The Notebook.</i>

166
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,258
I was pretty manly
till I mentioned

167
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,393
Ryan Gosling
in <i>The Notebook,</i> huh?

168
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,978
Even I haven't seen it, Ted.

169
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,564
Just think, this is the house

170
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,182
your kids are going
to grow up in.

171
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:37,319
They are going to
roast marshmallows

172
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,970
in this fireplace.

173
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,021
They're gonna
experiment

174
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:42,190
with recreational drugs

175
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,525
on that porch.

176
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:44,776
They're gonna sit
on a couch right here

177
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,495
and listen to your
boring stories about...

178
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:49,698
"For sale" sign?

179
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:52,284
Are you selling this place?

180
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,453
Yeah.

181
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,954
Why?

182
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,926
Because I'm moving to Chicago.

183
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:08,805
Ow.

184
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,353
So, what are
we gonna do--

185
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,555
put something in their food,

186
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,573
key their car?
Ooh,

187
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,275
do either
of those cigars explode?

188
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:18,378
Hold on, Wile E. Coyote,
I think I got something.

189
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,631
He's checking
out the hostess.

190
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:25,101
Now, a guy who's happily in
a relationship sees a girl

191
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:29,823
like that, he'll check her out
maybe 14, 15 times, tops.

192
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,375
16 times, tops.

193
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:36,246
So Krirsten's more invested
in the relationship

194
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,381
than her fella is.

195
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,166
That could spell trouble.

196
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,135
Challenge accepted.

197
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,288
Hey, do you think it's bad luck
for a bride

198
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,258
to break up two strangers
a week before her wedding?

199
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,646
I'd say it's very bad luck...
for Krirsten.

200
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,637
Ow, I hate this table so much!

201
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,738
Why would you move

202
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,356
to Chicago?

203
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,158
Because it's the perfect town
for me.

204
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,277
I-It's like a Clevelandy
New York,

205
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,811
and-- don't act like
you haven't noticed--

206
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,114
my hair excels in the wind.

207
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,165
Besides,

208
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,416
you're moving to Rome.

209
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:16,002
Yeah, for a year,
a-and when we get back,

210
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:18,171
we need you to be here waiting
for us,

211
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:21,841
hopefully living in this house
with your future bride.

212
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,044
Wha... what future bride?

213
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,095
The girl.

214
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:26,112
She's out there

215
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:28,131
walking around New York City
right now,

216
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,767
probably in a pair
of really cute boots

217
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,669
that she's gonna let me borrow
whenever I want

218
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:33,887
because we're the same size.

219
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,555
She is out there, Ted.

220
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,274
Is she, really?
Because I've looked.

221
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,309
I have looked high

222
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,561
and low for someone I can love

223
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,980
and adore and cook waffles for.

224
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,532
The closest I've come is
Marshall.

225
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:46,683
He does love your waffles.

226
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:47,850
It's the
cinnamon.

227
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,369
I add cinnamon.

228
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:52,322
She's not in New York.

229
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,856
Maybe she's in Chicago.

230
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:56,660
Okay, you are being ridiculous.

231
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,162
You are going to find someone
here in New York

232
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,247
that you love
just as much as I love Marshall.

233
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,632
And you,

234
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:06,703
if you let Judy talk you out
of going to Italy, so help me,

235
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:10,507
I will never let you stuff
my ravioli again.

236
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,258
I'm gonna take you
off speaker.

237
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,543
Lily, you got to relax.

238
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:16,596
Okay, my mom is psyched
about Italy.

239
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,064
She keeps making jokes
about how she's gonna

240
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,768
come live with us in Rome
and sleep on the couch

241
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,069
and cook every meal for us

242
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,071
so we never have to go
to a restaurant

243
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:26,222
the whole year we're there.

244
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:27,273
It's not a joke.

245
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,241
By not saying no

246
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,276
to me right now,
you are giving me

247
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,529
your full consent
for that to happen.

248
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,735
I got to go.

249
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,903
"I'm probably saying
some political stuff

250
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:42,172
right now to sound smart."

251
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,708
"I'm probably referring
to some snooty podcast

252
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,593
to sound even smarter."

253
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,128
"I'm probably saying
something in French."

254
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,345
Aah!

255
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,346
My God...

256
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,265
Ow.

257
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,266
Okay,

258
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,284
you want to break them up?

259
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,468
I got a plan.

260
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,637
It's something I know has worked
in the past,

261
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,055
but it-it's, it's risky,

262
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,558
so it's, it's not too late
to call it off.

263
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,290
No way, I'm in.

264
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,145
Good, 'cause it's too late
to call it off.

265
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,979
Observe.

266
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,197
And that is
why the senate

267
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,698
can't push anything through.

268
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,018
And Doug Mand said
the same thing in his podcast.

269
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,725
It's like,
"Après moi le déluge!"

270
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,775
Ooh.

271
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:19,793
Oh, my gosh.

272
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,327
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

273
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,580
Yes, yes, yes.

274
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:24,714
Yes!

275
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:25,465
What?

276
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,783
Yes!

277
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:27,950
I will marry you!

278
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:29,502
Even though
a ring in a champagne glass

279
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,254
is a total cliché
and this is a cushion cut.

280
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,289
And how long have I been hinting
that I want a princess cut?

281
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,424
But yes!

282
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,975
That's a mistake.
That's not from me.

283
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,960
It's not?

284
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:41,231
We've only been together
seven years.

285
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,150
Now it becomes clear.
Here we go.

286
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:46,603
You want commitment the same way
you want my brother to work for you.

287
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,356
I'm sorry I didn't put an
engagement ring in your drink.

288
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,642
The way you chug booze,
I'm surprised you even noticed.

289
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:54,811
So, when are you leaving?

290
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,279
Day after the wedding.

291
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,447
What?

292
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,616
You can't miss the day
after the wedding.

293
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,836
That's when we sit around
all hungover, drinking mimosas

294
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:05,038
and talking smack
about who looked fat.

295
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,006
That's my Christmas.

296
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:10,176
Why are you in such a rush
to get out of there?

297
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,013
Oh.

298
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,499
Of course.

299
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,601
You're not leaving
because you think

300
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:20,770
the love of your life
isn't in New York.

301
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,939
You're leaving because
you think she is.

302
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,324
And this time next week,

303
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:27,360
she'll be married
to your best friend.

304
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,814
Baby!

305
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,014
I am in the middle

306
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,366
of something super
dramatic here.

307
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:36,202
But real quick: If you let Judy
come to Rome with us,

308
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,071
you are going to have
to find someone else

309
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,156
to do your laundry
and massage your feet.

310
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,293
Oh, my gosh, she's going to do
all that, won't she?

311
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,211
Lily, you have to stop
freaking out.

312
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,630
Nothing is going to screw up
the plan.

313
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,115
We're doing this.

314
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:50,550
I love you.

315
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,502
I love you, baby. Bye.

316
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,140
Hello?

317
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:58,508
Hi. Marshall Eriksen?

318
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,594
I'm calling from the New York
State Judiciary Committee.

319
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,013
Uh, you applied for a judgeship
a few months ago, remember?

320
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,682
Uh, of... of course.

321
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,933
Well, I have good news.

322
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,102
We have a last-minute opening
on the bench.

323
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,154
What are you saying to me
right now?

324
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:12,739
I'm saying congratulations.

325
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:14,908
We want you to be a judge.

326
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:22,495
So, you want me to be a judge?
Yes.

327
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,628
And I would start a week from Tuesday?
Yes.

328
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,464
Could I maybe start
a year from Tuesday?

329
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:27,128
No.

330
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,828
Got to be a week from Tuesday?
Yes.

331
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,330
And I'd be a real judge?
Yes.

332
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,364
With a robe?
Yes.

333
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,332
Gavel?
Yes.

334
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,134
Wacky Southern accent?
No.

335
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,402
Now, counselor,

336
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,553
are you absolutely sure?

337
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,055
Yes.

338
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:38,372
And I have to be
in New York for this?

339
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:39,856
Yes.
I can't telecommute?

340
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:40,364
No.

341
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:42,142
I couldn't be the crazy
speakerphone judge?

342
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,976
No.
Could I be a hologram?

343
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,578
No.
Animatronic robot

344
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,664
like Abe Lincoln
from the Hall of Presidents

345
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,515
that I control from afar
with a joystick?

346
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,451
No.

347
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,786
Do you remember the giant
Jor-El head from <i>Superman?</i>

348
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,087
Yes.
Well, what if I...?

349
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,672
No.
Is there any way

350
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,340
that I could do this

351
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,343
and also spend
the next year of my life

352
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:02,228
in Italy with my wife?
No.

353
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,297
This is such a big decision.

354
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,516
I-I'm not good at big decisions.

355
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:09,302
Are you sure you want
to be a judge?

356
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:14,023
Wow. Now that we've broken up
a seven-year relationship

357
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,725
just 'cause they
stole our table,

358
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,610
I feel kind of...
Awesome?

359
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:20,196
I was going to say horny,
but yeah, awesome, too.

360
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,450
No way.

361
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:24,868
Are you kidding me?
What?

362
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,069
Whoa. Is there
going to be a fight?

363
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,320
Okay, here's the play.

364
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,289
You take the girl, and
the guy and I will watch.

365
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,858
Hello. Just the people
we want to see.

366
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,528
We got in a pretty big fight
because of you guys.

367
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,297
We had to call our
therapists after hours.

368
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,299
Not cool.

369
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,134
Anyway, it got us
to where we are now.

370
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:42,585
We're getting married!

371
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:44,671
And I'm taking
her last name.

372
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,256
You should think
about doing the same thing.

373
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,974
Well, good night.
Good night.

374
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,676
Good night.
Congratulations.

375
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:52,011
Yes, definitely.

376
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:54,230
That was us.

377
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:57,100
We made that happen.

378
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,018
We're pretty cool.

379
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,354
And, you know,
a week from today,

380
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:04,691
we are going to be legend...
wait for it...

381
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:05,742
Married.

382
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,677
Legend-married.
Legend-married.

383
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:13,116
Robin Scherbatsky,
I love you so damn much.

384
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,702
I love you, too,
Barney Scherbatsky.

385
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:17,370
That sounds good.

386
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:18,922
Shh.
Think about it.

387
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,423
<i>They're happy.</i>

388
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,342
<i>And I'm happy for them.</i>

389
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,794
I want them to have an amazing
life together. I just...

390
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,846
I just think it would
be best for everyone

391
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,131
if I wasn't around for it.

392
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,051
Did something happen recently
between you and Robin?

393
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,636
No.

394
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,338
Where's the poop, Ted?

395
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,442
She called me up the other day.

396
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,260
<i>She was trying</i>
<i>to dig up this locket</i>

397
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:43,196
<i>she had buried behind</i>
<i>the Central Park Carousel,</i>

398
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,265
<i>and I blew off that</i>
<i>big interview to go help her.</i>

399
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:50,286
And then... it started raining.

400
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:55,408
I'll, uh...

401
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,626
I'll see you
at the wedding.

402
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,277
Yeah.

403
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,296
<i>Even now,</i>
<i>after all these years,</i>

404
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:02,632
there's still just
this part of me where,

405
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,250
if there's even
the slightest chance

406
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:06,118
something I do
could make Robin smile,

407
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,222
I don't even think about it--
I just do it.

408
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,473
I mean, if I could make

409
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,392
that locket magically appear,
I would.

410
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,460
I would open a vein in my arm

411
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,646
if I could bleed
that locket out,

412
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,815
just to make her happy.

413
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,102
That's just
a really sucky way to feel

414
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:25,471
about your best friend's
fiancée.

415
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,410
So I'm going to come
to the wedding,

416
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,363
you know, I'll have a good time,
but after that, I...

417
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,565
What?

418
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:39,836
I know where the locket is.

419
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,421
What?

420
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,539
I know where the locket is.

421
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,458
It-it was a few years ago,

422
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,126
<i>right before you were</i>
<i>supposed to marry Stella.</i>

423
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,795
<i>I went down to the bar</i>
<i>one night</i>

424
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:50,713
<i>to get a drink,</i>
<i>and what should I see?</i>

425
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:51,848
Lily!

426
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,683
Hey, girl.

427
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,568
I got a question for you.

428
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:59,171
Why isn't Ted marrying me?

429
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,440
Whoa...

430
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,442
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

431
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,943
I'm sorry.

432
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:07,313
I just... I-I should
be happy for him,

433
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:09,348
and yet here I am,

434
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,069
moving off to Japan just
to get away from him.

435
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,154
And-and I guess
to see those...

436
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:18,041
those terra-cotta warriors
and the Great Wall.

437
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,626
Well, that's China.

438
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:20,860
What? This?

439
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:22,295
No, it's just a paper plate.

440
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,715
Uh, we should
get out of here.

441
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:26,966
Come on. Come on.
Oh, totally.

442
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:29,636
I know just where we should go.

443
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:34,090
Man, you're fast
when you're drunk.

444
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:37,093
But at least you're still
making good decisions.

445
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,811
Central Park,
around midnight,

446
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:40,763
digging a hole
with a spoon.

447
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:41,931
Solid.

448
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,150
Jackpot.

449
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:45,184
What is that?

450
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:47,937
My something old.

451
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:53,776
This locket was my grandma's.

452
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:57,730
She kept it hidden in her butt
all through World War II.

453
00:16:57,732 --> 00:16:58,931
What? Where was she?

454
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,584
Winnipeg.

455
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:03,920
Oh, come on.

456
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,205
Lily, it's a joke.

457
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,207
Yeah, I was
going to wear this

458
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,342
when I married Ted.

459
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:10,877
I guess that's not
going to happen.

460
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:14,263
So I am taking it
with me to Japan.

461
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:17,850
Okay, Lily, help me put
this locket in my butt.

462
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,635
Okay. Uh, you know what?

463
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:23,923
Why don't we put it
in this pencil box instead?

464
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:27,860
Oh, and then I will take the
pencil box with me to Japan.

465
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:30,646
Okay. Hey, Lily?

466
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:33,866
Help me put this
pencil box in my butt.

467
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,154
Wait!

468
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:40,656
There's one other thing
I have to do.

469
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,492
Lily, it's very important.

470
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,961
It's something
that needs to happen

471
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,296
right now.
Yeah?

472
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:48,831
Then she barfed in my face.

473
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,133
It was a lovely night.

474
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,886
Wait. You put the locket
in the race car pencil box?

475
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:56,889
Yep. And then Robin
took it to Japan.

476
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:59,225
No, she didn't.

477
00:17:59,227 --> 00:18:04,296
It's sitting on my desk
at home right now.

478
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,482
It's been with me all along.

479
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,352
Ted.
The locket is in the pencil box.

480
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,137
This is awesome.

481
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:12,438
Ted.

482
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,940
No, I just... I just mean,

this is going to be
the best wedding gift ever.

484
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,828
