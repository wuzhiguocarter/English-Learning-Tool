1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:03,284
Lily, I just saw
the worst thing ever!

2
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:04,884
(whispering): Kind of busy
right now, Marshall.

3
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,402
Quiet.
He can hear you.

4
00:00:06,404 --> 00:00:07,553
MARSHALL: Who's "he"?!

5
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,022
He's coming!
Everyone shut up!

6
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,990
NARRATOR: <i>Okay, kids, you're probably</i>
<i>wondering how</i>

7
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:12,325
<i>we all got here.</i>

8
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:14,965
Oh, hey, buddy, can
we borrow your air mattress?

9
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:16,566
My mom's coming into
town for a few days.

10
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:17,834
Absolutely not.

11
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:20,270
Bummer, I guess
she can't stay with us.

12
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:22,906
Hey, look,
what I just found.

13
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:25,942
A list of hotels and other
creative housing options.

14
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:28,328
Baby, my mom is not
staying at a hotel.

15
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,820
Or our storage unit.

16
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:32,316
Why can't we borrow
your air mattress?

17
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,816
Because when you animals
borrow things,

18
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:34,918
you never return them.

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,369
That's ridiculous.

20
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,655
No, my Cleveland, Ohio,
Chamber of Commerce

21
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:40,657
mini-cooler
is ridiculous.

22
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:42,659
Ridiculous at keeping
stuff cold

23
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:45,378
while also promoting Ohio's
second-largest rubber producer.

24
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,631
Watch your back, Akron.

25
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,216
I totally gave that back.

26
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:51,301
And what about that
"Vote For Ted" hoodie

27
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:54,437
from when I ran for treasurer
in high school?

28
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,472
Mrs. Gooding said

29
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:59,559
my concession speech was,
"full of grace."

30
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:02,679
I don't recall
borrowing that.

31
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,232
And whatever happened
to my limited edition DVD

32
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:07,701
of the classic 1989
Silverman-McCarthy romp,

33
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:11,988
<i>Weekend at Bernie's,</i>
"borrowed" well over six months ago?

34
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,623
Yeah, I'm
keeping that.

35
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,158
Those extra features
are awesome.

36
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,859
I mean, that making-of
documentary?

37
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,696
"How Bernie Avoided The Gurney:
A Cinematic Journey."

38
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:22,832
Look, I'm just tired
of people borrowing things

39
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,134
and never returning them.

40
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:27,754
If you don't believe me,
ask my ex-friend Stuart.

41
00:01:27,756 --> 00:01:30,140
Ted, I gave your red
cowboy boots back

42
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:31,508
the day after Halloween.

43
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,010
How could you lie to me
right to my face, Stuart?

44
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:38,932
You are a horrible
human being.

45
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,817
Congrats on
your daughter's christening.

46
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,405
And where's the worst abuser
of my generosity, Barney?

47
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:48,391
Or should I say,
"Borrow-ney"?

48
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,609
You should
never say that.

49
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,161
And I think he's out
with Patrice.

50
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:53,363
Uch, Patrice?
That's still happening?

51
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:54,781
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, you remember Patrice.</i>

52
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,416
<i>She worked</i>
<i>with your Aunt Robin.</i>

53
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:59,002
Robin! You left your purse
at the vending machine,

54
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,453
and some guy tried
to steal it!

55
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:06,042
I fought him off, but I think
I dislocated my shoulder.

56
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,628
You scratched the leather! Oh!

57
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,797
Can't you do anything right,
Patrice?!

58
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,183
That Barney-and-Patrice
thing is so bogus.

59
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,352
He's clearly trying
to get back at me

60
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:16,853
for rejecting him.

61
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:18,471
Um, Robin, after you
rejected Barney,

62
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:19,756
didn't he reject you?

63
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,941
And didn't you go

64
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:23,560
over to his place and
try to sleep with him

65
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:24,778
in your purple-and-
black underwear?

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,280
Hey, uh, Lil, feel free
to disregard that

67
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:29,866
"Don't tell anyone
about this ever" thing.

68
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:31,234
She has your
mini-cooler.

69
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,452
I knew it!

70
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,037
But seriously,
what other reason would

71
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,323
Barney have to
date Patrice?

72
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,774
It's an over-correction.

73
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:40,543
How dare you?!
What is that?!

74
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:43,613
Barney was engaged to Quinn,
a stripper he never really trusted.

75
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:45,281
So he overcorrects
by dating her opposite:

76
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:47,167
warm and nurturing
Patrice.

77
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,002
LILY: That does happen,
like Ted.

78
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:52,555
After you broke up
with sweet innocent Victoria.

79
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,290
No, you hang up first.

80
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,809
No, you hang up first.

81
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:56,810
No, you hang up first.

82
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:58,395
Hang up,
you little bitch!

83
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,564
Over-correction.

84
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:02,999
Yeah. And it's not just
relationships.

85
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,235
Remember when that
comedy club owner told Marshall

86
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,187
that his "funny fish names"
stand-up act

87
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,071
didn't have enough edge?

88
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:13,276
Flounder?
I barely know her! Oh!

89
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:14,944
Over-correction.

90
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,447
Although it was better
than his Chris Rock rip-off.

91
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,750
A trout with a daughter
has one job.

92
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,836
One job!

93
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:26,122
To keep her off
the fishing pole!

94
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,658
LILY:
You suck!

95
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,877
Lily!

98
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:46,650
I'm a little worried
about Ted.

99
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:51,071
I mean, we're parents now,
and even Barney is moving on.

100
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:54,491
I just wish he had
someone to talk to.

101
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:56,026
Even for a week.

102
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,295
Or you know, four days,
three nights.

103
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:59,663
My mom is not staying
with Ted!

104
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,531
He'd love her bacon-
gummy bear pancakes.

105
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:05,052
I'm her special boy,
I get her special pancakes.

106
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,370
But my dad is here
nannying all the time.

107
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,505
Then add your mom in?

108
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:11,475
This place is crowded
enough already.

109
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:13,043
(knocking)
MICKEY: Hey, Lil,

110
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,878
let me know
how the pump's working.

111
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,379
I cleaned it for you.

112
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,765
It's fine, Dad.
Yeah, I had

113
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:21,218
to check the suction,
so I tested it on myself.

114
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,569
Oh, no.

115
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,822
Don't worry, the suction's fine,

116
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,556
actually kind of nice.

117
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:32,729
Okay, Barney is so not
for real about Patrice.

118
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,481
Today he did the craziest,

119
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,700
most clearly staged
for my benefit thing ever.

120
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,619
Hey, Patrice,
you ready for lunch?

121
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,870
Sure.

122
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:41,088
(scoffs)

123
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,123
Right, right?

124
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,057
I mean,

125
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:46,710
what's next, birthday gifts?

126
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:50,097
Wake up, people, this is
not an overcorrection,

127
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,465
it's fraud, and we need

128
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,434
to keep trying
to stop this.

129
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,519
What do you mean,
"keep trying"?

130
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,755
Barney is not
who you think he is.

131
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,690
What do you mean?

132
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,758
Well, he has a book
of plays he uses

133
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
to trick women
into sleeping with him.

134
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,897
Oh, no way,
Barney's my honey bear.

135
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,782
Actually, one of his plays
is called The Honey Bear.

136
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:10,200
He dresses up
like Winnie the Pooh,

137
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,569
and the next thing you know,
his hand's stuck in your pot.

138
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:15,739
Robin, you're a doll
for worrying about me,

139
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:18,108
but that doesn't sound at all
like my Barney.

140
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,944
Why won't you let me
help you, Patrice?!

141
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,549
She can't see
that Barney is using her,

142
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,835
and it breaks my heart.

143
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,219
You know, I-I-I
love Patrice.

144
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:31,805
We're like sisters.

145
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,257
You've never gotten
through even one exchange

146
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,525
without screaming at her.

147
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:35,926
Sisters fight, Ted!

148
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,644
But the bond

149
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:39,179
is always there.

150
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,230
Okay?
Okay.

151
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:41,682
And that's
why I need

152
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:44,268
to steal The Playbook
and show it to Patrice,

153
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,403
so she'll believe me.

154
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:49,907
Or you could do
almost anything else

155
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,641
and not sound
so creepy.

156
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,943
TED:
Robin,

157
00:05:52,945 --> 00:05:55,412
seriously, this obsession
isn't healthy.

158
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:57,314
Just let it go.

159
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,648
(sighs)

160
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,317
Maybe you guys are right.

161
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,318
(sighs)

162
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,537
Thanks for talking
some sense into me.

163
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,756
(whirring)

164
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,161
Lily, can I ask you

165
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,296
a question?

166
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:13,430
If it's "Did somebody put gravel

167
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:15,265
in the couch cushions
you're sleeping on,"

168
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:16,499
absolutely not.

169
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,552
What would be the motive?

170
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:19,970
No, it's not that.

171
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,689
Uh, don't tell Marshall
because he's not ready,

172
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:26,109
but I think I might want

173
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:29,512
to get back out there
and meet a nice man.

174
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,782
Wow, that's great, Judy.

175
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,150
And I thought
you might be able to help

176
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:34,818
because you always look
so good.

177
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,653
You think I look good?

178
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:38,956
I mean, you dress
like a Duluth streetwalker,

179
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,241
but my son seems to like it.

180
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:43,293
I'll take it.

181
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:46,163
So, any advice?

182
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:49,216
Well, first I'd throw out
any giant sweater

183
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:50,500
with a horse on it.

184
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,585
Even the ones...?
Even the ones

185
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:53,971
that have manes
with real horse hair, yes.

186
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:56,173
And second, I'd let the gals
out to play a little more.

187
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:58,208
The gals?

188
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:01,645
Oh...

189
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:04,514
you mean the Minnesota Twins.

190
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,485
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, Robin was</i>
<i>about to give up</i>

191
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:11,888
<i>on ever finding The Playbook</i>
<i>until...</i>

192
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,824
(beeps, hisses)

193
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:16,726
(choir singing)

194
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:21,398
Ugh, the Bro Code, damn it.

195
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,566
(beeps, hisses)

196
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,788
(sighs)

197
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:29,673
(hissing)

198
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,842
(choir singing)

199
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,515
David Lee Roth's autobiography?

200
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,133
Crap.

201
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:41,101
(sighs)

202
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,386
"To the best wingman ever.

203
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:43,553
"We'll always have Panama.

204
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:46,023
Love, Diamond Dave."

205
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,894
(hissing)

206
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:56,366
Patrice, it's really nice of you
to buy Robin a new purse,

207
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:59,069
but it's not your fault that
the other one got scratched.

208
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:02,456
Anyway, just get
yourself over here.

209
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,124
I've got the tree,
the decorations,

210
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,492
and the know-how
from <i>Lethal Weapon 2</i>

211
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,744
to pop that shoulder
right back into place.

212
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:10,464
Yep, there is not one reason
to leave this apartment

213
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,666
for even a second tonight.

214
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,955
Ow.

215
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,378
How's my favorite architect?
Other than incredibly handsome.

216
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:24,657
Hey, Mom.

217
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,242
No, it's Robin.

218
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,576
What do you need?

219
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,328
For reasons
that aren't important,

220
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,930
I'm trapped in Barney's closet.

221
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:33,599
Help get me out, and I'll return
your <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i> DVD.

222
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:36,635
No way, that's not enough to get
me involved in your crazy mess.

223
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:37,836
I'll also go with you

224
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:40,039
to the five-day fan convention
in the desert.

225
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,091
You'll come with me
to Bernie Man?

226
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,425
Yes, just hurry.

227
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:45,127
JUDY (over baby monitor):
Ooh...

228
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:48,664
someone's excited to see me.

229
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,299
Who's Mama's big boy?

230
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,469
Who is Mama's big boy?

231
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:56,188
Wait.

232
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,506
MICKEY:
I am.

233
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:59,475
Mickey?

234
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:02,978
And I've been bad.

235
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:08,517
Get off my mommy.

236
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:15,824
(knocking)

237
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,580
Hugh Hefner
in your lobby right now.

238
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,749
I'm gonna grab my robe.

239
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,727
"Teddy's first Christmas"?

240
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,562
Barney, are these my ornaments?

241
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:38,714
That could be anyone's
baby handprint, Ted.

242
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:42,651
Now, come on, Hef's old,
but he moves like a cheetah.

243
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:49,491
(sighing)

244
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:56,415
(hissing)

245
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,833
(choir singing)

246
00:09:57,835 --> 00:10:00,652
(gasping)

247
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:08,177
Why would you do that...

248
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,095
with Mickey?

249
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:13,215
I've been lonely,
Marshall, and all the men

250
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:18,187
in St. Cloud's idea of romance
is taking me ice fishing.

251
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:19,972
That was me and
your father's thing.

252
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,523
Plus,

253
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:24,560
call it an overcorrection,
but it's kind of nice

254
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,863
being with a sophisticated,
big-city man.

255
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,097
(belches)

256
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:31,533
You know, I don't know
what the big deal is.

257
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:34,036
You've been bumping uglies
with my daughter for years.

258
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:36,955
The second I climb up on your
mom, it's the end of the world?

259
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:39,458
(groans)

260
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,443
How could you think
that was Hef?

261
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:43,045
It was
an honest mistake.

262
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,080
That guy was black, Ted.

263
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,716
I guess I just don't notice
that kind of stuff.

264
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:52,388
(hissing)

265
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:58,594
(exclaims)

266
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,813
(sighs)

267
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:03,982
We'll get to the grotto
one day, my pet.

268
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,435
One day.

269
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:07,903
How's my favorite architect?

270
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:08,854
Other than well-endowed.

271
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:10,155
Mom?

272
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:11,657
No, it's Robin again.

273
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,975
Look, you've got to come
back in and get my purse.

274
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:16,161
Nope, I'm done. Bye, Robin.

275
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:17,246
Wait!

276
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:18,914
What if I told you
I was looking at

277
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,482
your red cowboy boots right now?

278
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,285
Describe them.

279
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,787
They're red
and they're cowboy boots.

280
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,088
That's them!

281
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,339
Why are they at Barney's?

282
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,658
Hey, Barney.

283
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,493
Just returning Ted's boots
I borrowed for Halloween.

284
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,212
You were a cowboy?

285
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,880
No, my wife
was Wonder Woman.

286
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:37,433
Can you believe Ted thinks a guy
can get laid wearing these?

287
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,453
Challenge accepted.

288
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:46,642
Do you know what
that sound is, Ted?

289
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:47,893
That's a red boot

290
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,145
about to be savagely
cut up by my pocketknife!

291
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,897
You mean my pocketknife.

292
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,899
I lent it to you two years ago.

293
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:58,153
(knocking)

294
00:11:58,155 --> 00:11:59,121
Hey.

295
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:01,373
Sorry about the
Hugh Hefner mix-up.

296
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,827
But seriously,
Jon Bon Jovi is downstairs.

297
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:07,579
You sure it isn't my landlady,
Mrs. Takahashi?

298
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,580
I'm serious.

299
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:09,832
The janitor just
mopped the floor.

300
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,867
Bon Jovi is literally
standing next to a sign

301
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:12,918
that says "Slippery When Wet."

302
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,138
Uh-uh.
I want those ornaments back.

303
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,174
(cell phone buzzes)

304
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:34,890
(knocking at door)

305
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,409
Damn it, Ted!

306
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:39,060
You get those ornaments
all year.

307
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,613
I just need
'em for Christmas!

308
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:42,831
Oh. Hey, Patrice.

309
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,199
Did you have any
trouble finding Rudolph?

310
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,668
No, it was right on Ted's
fire escape like you said.

311
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,837
Are you sure he's okay
with us borrowing it?

312
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,006
Positive.

313
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:56,128
I got your purse.
(whispering): Oh, Ted, you're the best!

314
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,880
But I'm trapped in Barney's
living room closet.

315
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,681
Oh, Ted, you're the worst.

316
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:00,749
Okay, enough messing around.

317
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:01,767
I'm calling in The Wolf.

318
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,019
Lily?
Lily.

319
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,657
(phone ringing nearby)

320
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:11,894
(ringing is louder)

321
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:14,563
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

322
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:17,599
(phone beeps) Hold on, Marshall's calling
me on the other line.

323
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,788
Lily, I just saw
the worst thing ever.

324
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,289
Kind of busy right
now, Marshall.

325
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,457
Quiet.
He can hear you.

326
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,458
Who's "he"?

327
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,877
He's coming!
Everyone shut up!

328
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:40,622
I'm just gonna grab this star
to put on top of the tree.

329
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:44,059
It's gonna be legend--
wait for it-- merry!

330
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,134
(sighs)

331
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:55,103
What are you doing here, Lily?

332
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,471
I've been using
Barney's apartment

333
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:57,973
to pump milk for Marvin.

334
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,358
What?! Why?

335
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,510
LILY: <i>Our apartment</i>
<i>is so crowded these days,</i>

336
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:03,328
<i>I don't get a minute to myself!</i>

337
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,364
<i>I have a key</i>
<i>to Barney's apartment,</i>

338
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,815
<i>he has a kick-ass couch,</i>

339
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,867
<i>and he DVR's all</i>
<i>the</i> Real Housewives <i>shows,</i>

340
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:11,536
<i>including the reunion specials.</i>

341
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,822
(whirring)

342
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:23,498
What are you doing here?

343
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,850
I came to get The Playbook

344
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,885
so I could show Patrice
who Barney really is.

345
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,304
Why can't you just
let them be happy?

346
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,556
Because they're not
really happy, Lily!

347
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,976
BARNEY: Patrice, can you grab my
computer from the bedroom?

348
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:36,678
I want to change my
Facebook status to "happy!"

349
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,480
You shouldn't have that.

350
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,849
You're right.

351
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:50,959
(sighs)
What?

352
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,628
Where is Ted?

353
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,365
My label maker!

354
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,501
No! I'm never coming out!

355
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:03,055
You know, Marshall, you've been
in there for a while now.

356
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:07,259
And I couldn't help but notice
you chugged that Super Big Gulp.

357
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:09,261
It's not gonna work, Mickey.

358
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:11,880
My bladder's
as big as your betrayal!

359
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:14,215
I see. So it's not gonna
bother you to think

360
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:17,319
about leaky faucets
or open hydrants,

361
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:21,273
or rushing rivers, or...

362
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,942
Oh, God, I got to pee. Oh!

363
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:26,495
What is this?

364
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,497
Where did you find that?

365
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:30,449
I didn't want to believe
that this existed,

366
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,284
but is this... The Playbook?

367
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:35,170
(whispering): Let's see him lie his
way out of this one.

368
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,072
Yes, it is.

369
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:38,239
These are

370
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,708
all the tricks I used

371
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,460
to get women to sleep with me.

372
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,879
What do you
mean, tricks?

373
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:46,515
Like...

374
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:49,134
"The Two-Can-Play-at-That Game."

375
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:53,421
Can I help you?

376
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:56,308
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this, but...

377
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,760
my wife is having an affair
with your husband.

378
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,096
I even found a list
of every dirty way

379
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,281
they've enjoyed
each others' bodies.

380
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:07,986
I wish there was some way
we could get back at them.

381
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:09,321
There is.

382
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,874
We can kill them. (laughs)

383
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:22,501
I'm sorry to be the
one to tell you this...

384
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:24,419
You're not who I
thought you were.

385
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:25,587
Patrice, I...

386
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,339
I need some air.

387
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:29,307
I...

388
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:31,226
Come on, Patrice, you...

389
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:34,846
You have got to
be kidding me.

390
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,268
Wait. Is that my mini-cooler?!

391
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,971
Not now, Ted.
Let's go!

392
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,907
Shh! Shh!

393
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,660
Patrice, I have done

394
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:52,030
some sleazy stuff to
seduce women, but

395
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,749
I want to be a better person.

396
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,817
You make me want to be
a better person.

397
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:58,486
I can't be with a man
who has a playbook.

398
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:00,488
I understand.

399
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:11,433
Whoa.

400
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:12,601
Whoa!

401
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:13,769
Whoa!

402
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,470
Whoa!

403
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:17,222
Is that my garbage can?!

404
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:22,598
I knew you were a keeper.
(laughs)

405
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,083
Oh.

406
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,335
(rapid, rhythmic beeping,
Barney sighs)

407
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,925
I should go explain
this to the super.

408
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,627
Hey, come with.
There's a small chance

409
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:36,078
Jon Bon Jovi's
down in the lobby.

410
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,147
"You Give Love a Bad Name"
is the first track

411
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:39,315
on my "Get Psyched" mix!

412
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:41,484
Mine, too!

413
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,605
(sighing)

414
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,027
You still don't believe
those two are for real?

415
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,778
I'll take that.

416
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,997
The Ted Mosby Store
is officially closed.

417
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,649
What spilled in here?

418
00:17:56,651 --> 00:17:58,034
Breast milk.

419
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,786
Seriously, I give and give,

420
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,206
and all I ask back
is a little bit of respect.

421
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:08,594
(sighs)

422
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,164
(laughs)
Okay, so tonight got weird.

423
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,849
You have no idea.

424
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,769
My mom's apparently ready
to get back out there.

425
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,021
Marshall, she told me
all about it,

426
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:20,890
and I was happy to help.

427
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,675
You helped?! Why?

428
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:25,344
I know it's hard to think of
your mom as a woman with needs,

429
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,480
but you have to let
her get out there

430
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,483
and rediscover her sexuality
with someone special.

431
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,786
Oh, you don't know.

432
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:37,206
No, uh, Marshall,
I <i>do</i> know.

433
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,692
You just think it's gross
because it's your parent.

434
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:41,026
But you know what?

435
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,962
It's beautiful.
Mm.

436
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:45,748
My mom

437
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,051
and your dad are humping.

438
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,721
(retching)

439
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:53,839
I think you should be happy
for them.

440
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,257
What? Why?

441
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,875
What is good about this?

442
00:18:56,877 --> 00:18:59,145
Well, first of all,
respect to Mickey.

443
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:01,480
Your mom's a piece.

444
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:03,099
She's no Ted's mom,
but she's a piece.

445
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,900
And secondly,

446
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:08,053
I mean, it's nice
that they found each other.

447
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,956
Sometimes you fall for someone
you'd never expect,

448
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,891
but that doesn't make it wrong.

449
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:15,111
Doesn't everyone deserve
to be happy?

450
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:17,329
I guess

451
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:19,415
none of us thought
of it that way.

452
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,617
Next round's on me.

453
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,754
(sighs)
Wow.

454
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,122
I know.

455
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,456
Barney's lost it.

456
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,175
He needs an intervention.

457
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:30,443
Oh!
Oh! Oh...

458
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:33,345
Robin, after
everything we've seen,

459
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:35,914
do you still think
Barney's faking this?

460
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,750
No, but we have
to stop it.

461
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:39,518
Barney is not
Barney anymore.

462
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,770
Well, people change.

463
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,805
But not this fast
and this drastically.

464
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,640
This is a cry
for help, okay?

465
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:48,027
If I was out of control, I
would want you guys to help me.

466
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,113
So, what do you
say? Intervention?

467
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:54,150
Intervention.

468
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,202
(sighs)
Oh, good. You're all here.

469
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:57,770
Um,

470
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:59,205
when Barney shows up,

471
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,574
it's important for him
not to feel ganged up on,

472
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,159
so, let's start with, um,

473
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,377
"We love you,
and we're worried about you."

474
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:08,614
ALL: We love you,
and we're worried about you.

475
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:10,449
Oh. Great.

476
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:12,718
But you know, with less pity
in your eyes.

477
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,804
Sweetie, sit down.

478
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:18,307
Uh, no. Only the person getting
the intervention sits down.

479
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,677
ALL:
Yeah.

480
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,096
Oh.

481
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,565
Please tell me
this is about my drinking.

482
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:30,803
Damn it.

483
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,796
So, we, um...
we just wanted to say

484
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:39,097
that we're sorry for
the way that we acted

485
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,428
when we found out
about you two.

486
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:47,032
Your happiness is
what is most important,

487
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:51,236
so, if you two want to date,
it's okay by us.

488
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:52,938
Who said anything
about dating?

489
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,406
This is just
about sex.

490
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:59,696
We're family...
with benefits.
