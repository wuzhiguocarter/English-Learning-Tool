1
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:03,237
Can I get you guys
anything to drink?

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:04,453
BOTH:
Scotch, neat.

3
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:05,103
Jinx.

4
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,238
(gasps)

5
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,043
Oh, my...

6
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,295
God.

7
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:16,115
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, you may be wondering</i>
<i>why five adults</i>

8
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:19,251
<i>in their 30s would take</i>
<i>a jinx so seriously.</i>

9
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,887
<i>It all started one day</i>
<i>five years ago.</i>

10
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,405
Ooh, <i>Van Helsing.</i>
Ooh, <i>Van Helsing.</i>

11
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:25,624
Jinx. You're jinxed.

12
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,359
That means that you
can't speak until someone

13
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,227
who was present for the
jinx says your name,

14
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,062
or else

15
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,064
you will have
very bad luck.

16
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,365
(scoffs)
That's ridiculous.

17
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,533
(both gasp)

18
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,918
You broke the jinx.

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,786
Marshall, I'm a grown-ass man.

20
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,788
I'm on my building's
co-op board.

21
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,708
When I say a Pinot Noir tastes
luxuriously earthy

22
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,127
with a hint of rhubarb,
I'm not faking it.

23
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,262
I've had several

24
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:48,597
of the same sexual partners
as Henry Kissinger.

25
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:51,717
I'm not about to stop talking
just because I was jinxed.

26
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,104
NARRATOR:
<i>Barney broke three limbs</i>

27
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,272
<i>and two vertebrae,</i>

28
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:57,957
<i>but he never broke</i>
<i>another jinx.</i>

29
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:01,226
<i>In fact, he started taking</i>
<i>jinxes way too seriously.</i>

30
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,762
Barney, I'm on hold
with Sports Talk AM

31
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,098
to talk to my childhood hero
from the Minnesota Twins.

32
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,116
Who's your childhood hero?

33
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:08,767
Frank Viola. Frank Viola--
jinx!

34
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,786
(over phone):
Hello, this is Frank.

35
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:11,870
Anyone there?

36
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:12,938
Hello?

37
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,158
I can hear you breathing,
you coward.

38
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,328
NARRATOR: <i>So, when someone</i>
<i>finally jinxed Barney</i>

39
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,696
<i>for the first time in years,</i>

40
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:22,447
<i>we were pretty psyched.</i>

41
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,133
The reign of terror is over!

42
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:26,502
I've had this cigar
in my pocket for two years,

43
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,088
waiting for this moment.

44
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,558
Aw, that would've been good
about two years ago.

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,626
Cheers.

46
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,561
(all whooping)

47
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,146
Huzzah!
Huzzah.

48
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:40,316
LILY: Oh, oh, oh, you want us
to say your name

49
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:41,967
and un-jinx you?

50
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,235
I don't think so, pal.

51
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,688
This is gonna
be a long jinx.

52
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,740
Like Yom Kippur
services long.

53
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:50,326
The only difference is,
Yom Kippur's a fast

54
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:52,611
and this one's
gonna be a slow.

55
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,363
Oh!
ROBIN: Now, Ted,

56
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,482
I was wondering if you could
expand upon what you were saying

57
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,818
earlier about
antiquated currency.

58
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,086
Ah, yes, yes.

59
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,955
Contrary to popular belief,

60
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,258
the buffalo nickel was modeled
on the Black Diamond bison

61
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,928
rather than the more iconic
Western Plains bison.

62
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,263
To wit,

63
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,831
if President Taft
had had his way,

64
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,252
we'd all be talking
about the egret nickel.

NARRATOR: <i>In the winter of 2012</i>
<i>the skyscraper</i>

68
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:32,985
<i>that I designed was</i>
<i>about to open,</i>

69
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,237
<i>which got me thinking</i>

70
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,456
<i>architecture professor</i>
<i>I ever had.</i>

71
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,126
So when the children
of our grandchildren's children

72
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,463
ask us "Who were we,"
they'll find the answer carved

73
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:49,084
into the granite poetry
of our architecture.

74
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,003
Okay.

75
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,389
It doesn't get any
better than that.

76
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:56,041
Class dismissed.

77
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,481
Wow, just wow.

78
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,682
Do you need something?

79
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,934
I have an apple I was hoping
to eat in silence.

80
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,887
Of course,
Professor Vinick, I, um,

81
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,722
I-I sketched out a design,

82
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,858
and it'd be such an honor
if you took a look at it.

83
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,160
Oh, well.

84
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,328
It is believed

85
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,333
that it took the pharaohs
over 100 years

86
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,118
to build the Sphinx.

87
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,271
So...

88
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,572
you think...

89
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,541
I should spend more time on it?

90
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,959
Oh, dear God, no.

91
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,177
This is terrible.

92
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,546
Then, why'd you mention
the Sphinx?

93
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,298
(laughs)

94
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,885
I find my mind is
often with the Sphinx.

95
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,638
Anyway, you'll never
be an architect.

96
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,256
<i>You'll never be an architect.</i>

97
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,590
<i>You'll never</i>
<i>be an architect.</i>

98
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,093
(laughing):
<i>You'll never be an architect!</i>

99
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:48,994
Well, guess what.

100
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,479
I sent Professor Vinick

101
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,264
the invitation
to the opening of my building,

102
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,233
so he'll see that
I did become an architect,

103
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,401
and that I've moved past
his petty, hurtful words.

104
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,237
ROBIN:
Wow.

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,604
15 years later and you're
still this obsessed.

106
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,373
Yeah, if Vinick ever
goes missing,

107
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,742
the cops are gonna come looking
for him in your basement.

108
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,495
Totally, he's Ted's pit guy.

109
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,213
How dare you?

110
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,248
And what is that?

111
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,916
A pit guy is someone

112
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,135
you've been obsessed with
for so long...

113
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,786
<i>that it's driven you</i>
<i>crazy enough</i>

114
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,788
<i>to throw them</i>
<i>in a pit in your basement</i>

115
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,724
<i>like in</i> The Silence
of the Lambs.

116
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:22,227
(screaming)

117
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,146
(laughing)

118
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,598
I'm not gonna <i>Silence</i>
<i>of the Lambs</i> him.

119
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,816
At most,

120
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,768
I'd <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> him.

121
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,636
Though I don't see
a scenario where he agrees

122
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,071
to play me in a pentathlon.

123
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,974
Yeah, I'm with Ted-- there
is no one I hate enough

124
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,609
to throw into a pit.

125
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,978
What?

126
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,531
NARRATOR: <i>When Robin's most hated</i>
<i>coworker Patrice</i>

127
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,699
<i>started dating Barney,</i>

128
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,584
<i>she became obsessed.</i>

129
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,120
Patrice, Patrice goes
in your pit.

130
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:51,757
Guys, I told you, I am done
obsessing about Patrice.

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,991
Just drop her.

132
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,042
Drop her in a pit.

133
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,294
Enough.

134
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,662
We all have people that
we would throw in our pits,

135
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,831
and I'm sure we all have people

136
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,634
who would like to throw us
in their pits.

137
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,520
Yeah, if Marshall
or I ever go missing,

138
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,638
I'll tell you whose
basement to look in.

139
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,357
Daryl LaCourte.

140
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,441
Oh, no.

141
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,692
It's creepy Daryl.

142
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:11,610
Let's get out of here
before he sees us.

143
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,062
Hey, hot sack
coming through.

144
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,847
Ha... ha...

145
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,699
Hi, Daryl. Hey, Daryl.
Hey!

146
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,985
I feel like I never see
you guys anymore.

147
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,371
Like whenever I'm getting
to a party, you're just leaving.

148
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:23,405
Even that party

149
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,123
at your place--
you guys just raced off

150
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,625
into the night at 7:30.

151
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,626
That's weird.

152
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,526
But this is

153
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,362
great-- the three hackmigos

154
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,080
back together again.

155
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,534
We played Hacky Sack together
once freshman year, Daryl.

156
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,036
Once.

157
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,805
November 14, 1996.

158
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:40,872
That is the best memory ever.

159
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:41,890
Sure.

160
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:43,542
(grunts)

161
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,178
The three hackmigos
for life.

162
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,230
To this day, we are
still getting e-mails

163
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:50,098
and posts from Daryl.

164
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,384
He has commented
on every photo

165
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,770
of Baby Marvin
we have ever posted,

166
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,821
and then

167
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:59,474
he comments on his own comments.

168
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,492
(door opens)

169
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,945
(all clamoring excitedly)

170
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,314
Hey, guys, look,
it's Bar...

171
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,564
none, my favorite

172
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,565
non-speaking

173
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,201
jinxed person
in the world.

174
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,052
How was

175
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:11,703
your day?

176
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,027
Yeah, I didn't get
a word of that.

177
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,594
Sorry, buddy.

178
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,865
Ah, Scherbatsky, it's
my favorite time of year.

179
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,599
Didn't know
you liked Christmas so much.

180
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,268
No, year-end reviews.

181
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,786
We get to fire some people.

182
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,955
Get into the spirit.

183
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:49,107
Look, Sandy, you might
enjoy firing people

184
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,459
for petty personal differences.

185
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:52,377
I'd hardly call giving
me gonorrhea

186
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,212
a petty personal difference.

187
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,547
But I am a professional,

188
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,883
and I would never fire someone
for unprofessional reasons.

189
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,668
Well, somebody's got to go.

190
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,337
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, the thing</i>
<i>about pit people,</i>

191
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,122
<i>sometimes you don't</i>
<i>even know you have one</i>

192
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,675
<i>until you have</i>
<i>a chance to push 'em in.</i>

193
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,210
Hi, Robin.

194
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,131
Not happening, bro.

195
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:17,519
Not happening, bro.

196
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,857
Hand get tired?

197
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,942
Not happening, bro.

198
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,244
I hold in my hand

199
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,646
the RSVP from Professor Vinick.

200
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,748
Uh-huh.

201
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,316
Ah, he's checked

202
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,951
"Will not attend,"
which is fine,

203
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,671
because all I needed
to know was that he knows.

204
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:39,675
So now I will throw this in
the trash and never look at it.

205
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,493
What's this?

206
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,428
"I believe you've sent this
to the wrong person.

207
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,348
I have no idea
who Ted Mosby is."

208
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,551
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

209
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,438
Oh, you'll remember who I am,
Professor Vinick.

210
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,508
You'll never forget it.

211
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,694
Not happening, bro.

212
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,465
Ted, just because we're coming
with you to Wesleyan

213
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,285
does not mean that we condone
your behavior.

214
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,116
Just using it as an excuse

215
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:10,002
to see the old campus...

216
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:12,338
and maybe watch you have
a complete mental breakdown.

217
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,641
What are you even gonna do
when you see Professor Vinick?

218
00:08:15,643 --> 00:08:18,043
Oh, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

219
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,916
Sweet merciful Franks Gehry
and Lloyd Wright,

220
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,169
from what brilliant mind was
this work of art sired?

221
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,721
Mosby.

222
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:31,640
Ted Mosby.

223
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,426
(coughing):
Architect.

224
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:35,477
But that's-that's...

225
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,346
Impossible?

226
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:39,765
Looks like
you were wrong, Vinick.

227
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,601
Dead wrong.

228
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:50,492
(distorted):
No!

229
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:53,395
(yells)

230
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:54,496
(laughs)

231
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:56,282
Be careful, Ted.

232
00:08:56,284 --> 00:09:00,252
Revenge fantasies never
work out the way you want.

233
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:02,671
Especially dance-
based revenge.

234
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:04,740
My prom was rough, guys.

235
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,091
LILY:
Ooh!

236
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,176
We're almost there.

237
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,345
Oh, I can't wait
to see the old campus.

238
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:12,214
I'm gonna grab one of those
giant dining hall hot dogs.

239
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,249
Oh, I love those huge wieners.

240
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:18,420
I'm not so sure you heard me.

241
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:22,308
I said, "I love
those huge wieners."

242
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,475
I love them.

243
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:24,693
In my mouth.

244
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:30,282
So, let me ask you a few
questions, Clarice... Patrice.

245
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:32,651
How would you rate
your performance

246
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:34,453
in the last six months?

247
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,322
Well, I don't like
to talk about myself,

248
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:38,991
but all my coworkers deserve
an A-double-plus,

249
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:40,409
that's for suresies.

250
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:41,577
Ooh,

251
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,329
fancy lotion.

252
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:46,715
It puts the lotion
in the basket.

253
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,585
It's just, this is
really nice lotion.

254
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,387
And what a pretty basket, Robin.

255
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,006
I know, that's why
I bought it, Patrice!

256
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,343
Man, it's like

257
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:58,978
nothing has changed.
Mmm, I know.

258
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,598
The bun, the relish.

259
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:07,936
That's a knee.

260
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,772
It's a beautifully
drawn knee, so?

261
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,146
That's a barn.

262
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:21,817
Oh, knee barn, right.

263
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:22,701
That's a great idea, Lily.

264
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,086
On the way home,
we should stop

265
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:25,120
at the knee barn,

266
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:26,922
pick us up some wholesale knees.
Yeah.

267
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:30,659
MAN:
Marshall? Lily!

268
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,045
You... you're here.

269
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:36,215
Hi, Daryl.
(quietly): Hi, Daryl.

270
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,182
Hi.

271
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,634
Wow,

272
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,019
after all these years.

273
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,504
You look just like you do
in my paintings.

274
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:45,974
Come here, guys.
(grunts)

275
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:49,845
There are men
and there are gods.

276
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:52,898
Antoni Gaudí was both.

<i>Good one, Ted.</i>

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,525
<i>Come on, Vinick,</i>
<i>give me an opening.</i>

281
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:05,360
Gaudí's architecture
gave expression

282
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:09,465
to the anarchic geometric form
of nature.

283
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,067
TED (mocking):
<i>"Gaudí's architecture..."</i>

284
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,636
<i>Actually, that's</i>
<i>a really good point.</i>

What are you
doing here, Daryl?

293
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:44,333
Well, I live
right down the street.

294
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:46,335
But I work
right here.

295

Whoa.
Oh, boy.

296
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,291
MARSHALL:
Are those...

297
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:55,127
(clears throat) ...our,
our faces up there, buddy?

298
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,178
Hack, yeah!

299
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,213
It was just as much
your idea as mine

300
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:00,716
to open up a Hacky Sack store
here at Wesleyan.

301
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:02,768
So you never left?

302
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,436
Once. I met a girl
on Craigslist,

303
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:07,139
and I flew to Boston
to meet her.

304
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:09,525
She was a man, 300 pounds,
and robbed me.

305
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,794
Still, the best
night of my life.

306
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,312
Until now!

307
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,814
The three hackmigos
back together again!

308
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:18,801
You know, I've been waiting
forever to give you something.

309
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:20,285
You're coming with me
to my house,

310
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,204
and I'm not taking no
for an answer.

311
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,741
BARNEY:
<i>Dude, this is your chance.</i>

312
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,993
<i>Set me free,</i>

314
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,779
MARSHALL:
<i>This is a tough one.</i>

315
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,748
<i>On the one hand, we might die.</i>

316
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,250
<i>On the other, you're jinxed.</i>

317
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:37,252
BARNEY:
<i>Let me free, Marshall.</i>

318
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:39,421
<i>This guy could be violent.</i>

319
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:42,591
MARSHALL:
<i>Violent... Viola...</i>

320
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,560
<i>Frank Viola.</i>

321
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:49,264
We would love to come
to your house, Daryl!

322
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,350
Yeah!

323
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:53,335
Okay, um...

324
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,971
how often are you
and Barney doing it?

325
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:58,240
That's a strange question,
Robin.

326
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:00,141
You're right.

327
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,910
Maybe I should leave.

328
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:03,478
Yeah, maybe
you should.

329
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,613
You're fired.

330
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:09,418
Wow. Just wow.

331
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,588
Ted Mosby.
I'm a former student of yours.

332
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,290
You know, I actually became
an architect.

333
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,176
Any chance you remember me?

334
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:19,845
Oh, please excuse me, I've been
teaching for over 20 years.

335
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,681
All the faces start
to blend together

336
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:25,834
unless you have a, a weird
mustache or, or something.

337
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:28,470
Junior year I tried
to grow muttonchops,

338
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:31,473
but people kept saying
my face made them nauseous.

339
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:34,109
Well, not people. You.

340
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,312
Anay, I would be honored
if you,

341
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,565
if you took a look
at my building.

342
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:43,986
This...

343
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,655
is hideous.

344
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:48,907
You'll never be an architect.

345
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,542
(echoing):
<i>You'll never be an architect.</i>

346
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:52,995
<i>You'll never be an architect.</i>
<i>You'll</i> never <i>be an architect!</i>

347
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,296
<i>You'll never be an architect.</i>

348
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,965
Wait. I was mistaken.

349
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,334
You most definitely
will be an architect.

350
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,502
Really?

351
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:01,870
These are astonishing,

352
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,840
Handlebar Pete.

353
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,480
So, when you said
"surprise in your house,"

354
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:15,017
what you really meant was
"surprise in the poorly lit

355
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,569
windowless basement
of your house."

356
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:20,239
Oh, you guys are gonna love
what I have to show you.

357
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:24,159
I am so excited, I could just
cry and laugh and scream

358
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,534
and just punch the wall

359
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,622
over and over and over
and over and over!

360
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:29,331
Could we just see it,

361
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,565
like, up in the
living room

362
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:34,870
or anywhere less...
gimp-storagey?

363
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,088
(laughs)
I just realized

364
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,840
I want to take
a picture of this.

365
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:41,293
I want to put your faces
on my mantel like a trophy.

366
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:42,678
Like a trophy!

367
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:48,433
Aah...!
Aah...!

368
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:54,193
(singsongy):
Here I come.

369
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:58,750
And I've got your surprise
right here!

370
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,833
No! We don't want
your surprise, Daryl!

371
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,052
We're not your amigos,

372
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:04,754
we're definitely
not your hackmigos.

373
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,489
And before you murder us,

374
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:08,858
you should know
that we have a child!

375
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,026
He probably has
eight or nine!

376
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:13,195
What? Murder?

377
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:16,148
I wanted to give you a check.

378
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,568
For $100,000...

379
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,705
for coming up with the idea
of the Three Hackmigos with me.

380
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,859
I brought you down here
to show you all my inventory.

381
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,080
Business has really exploded.

382
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:32,548
(laughs)

383
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,533
I mean, I'm sort
of the Mark Zuckerberg

384
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:37,553
of jam-band concert
parking lot athletics.

385
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:38,671
Well, second.

386
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,800
But I'm coming for you,
Devil Stick Ron.

387
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:45,003
(screaming)

388
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,138
Why would you fire me?

389
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,557
Because nobody should be
as happy as you are.

390
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:55,430
And also your cookies...
they're only pretty good.

391
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,816
(gasps)

392
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,487
Robin, is this really about me?

393
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,658
(voice breaking):
No, it's not.

394
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:16,835
The old "fire and bang."
Respect, Scherbatsky.

395
00:16:19,505 --> 00:16:23,258
Pretty good, right?
Right, Handlebar Pete?

396
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,963
Ah, you got it easy with
that sweet, sweet 'stache.

397
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:31,049
Hey, Ted, I see you're holding
a little version of your building

398
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:32,350
and yelling at strangers.

399
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:34,219
So I assume it all worked out?

400
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:37,088
I realized, since I work
in a three-dimensional medium,

401
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,557
the only way to really stick it
to Vinick would be

402
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,443
with a three-dimensional model.

403
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:43,395
Whatever you do,
don't march in there

404
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,397
thinking, "I'm
gonna do the worm.

405
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,448
That'll show 'em!"

406
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,400
Seriously, guys,

407
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:50,869
I can't stress enough
how bad my prom was.

408
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:53,071
Speaking of the past...

409
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:56,374
Wow, we feel like idiots.
We're sorry.

410
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,827
You know, honestly,
it's fine.

411
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:00,545
Look how great I'm doing.

412
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:02,380
Look at what I've built.
I don't need

413
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:03,948
the validation
of some people from college

414
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,166
to feel good about myself.

415
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,419
My life is amazing!

416
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:10,288
I own a timeshare in
St. Barts with P-Funk!

417
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,956
The, the whole band?

418
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,458
Yeah.

419
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,627
Do you guys jam?

420
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:19,130
That's <i>all</i> we do.

421
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:20,398
(all gasp)

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,649
So, you completely rejected

423
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:22,934
the guy who's been obsessing

424
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:26,738
about you for 16 years,
and he was okay with it?

425
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,139
Whoa.

426
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:31,809

adjusted than I am?

455

And I realize shouting that

456

You guys want anything?

459
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:05,120
Spicy beef jerky.

460
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:07,238
Got you loud and clear.

461
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:09,541
(sighs)

462
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:14,512
Oh, my God!
Barney!

463
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:15,880
You unjinxed me!

464
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,432
I'm free! If the bison

465
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,434
on the nickel could hear you
talk about them,

466
00:19:19,436 --> 00:19:21,553
they would diminish their
population even further on purpose.

467
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:24,139
If Lily wants a big wiener in
her mouth, she's got my number.

468
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:26,357
And I'm sorry that you took the
rap for all the farting on

469
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,226
the car ride up here.
That was me! (sighs)

470
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:30,228
The ring!
What's, what's, what's the ring?

471
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,064
Right, the ring. I'm gonna ask
Patrice to marry me.

472
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:34,115
BOTH:
Are you serious?

473
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:35,984
Jinx! Good!

474
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:38,036
I need to say some things
without you interrupting.

475
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:41,873
Yes, I am serious.
I know that if you could talk,

476
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,241
you'd say that I'm crazy

477
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,792
or that I'm overcorrecting
or that I'm moving too fast.

478
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:45,960
But you would be wrong.

479
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:48,663
Look, I have banged my way
through every bimbo

480
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,632
in the tristate area,
and it left me

481
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,750
feeling nothing but, but broken.

482
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:55,753
But now, with Patrice,

483
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:59,357
for the first time in my life,
I feel settled and happy.

484
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,726
I want to feel this way forever.

485
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:04,345
So tomorrow night on the roof

486
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:06,097
of the World Wide News
building--

487
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,398
that's Patrice's favorite spot--

488
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,267
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

489
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:11,502
Ah, poot-tu-tat!
You're jinxed.

490
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:13,655
I'll unjinx you if you'll follow
these two rules:

491
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:15,823
one: you can't try to talk me
out of it,

492
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:20,495
and two: you can't tell anybody.
Agreed?

493
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:25,950
It's a jinx swear,
so if you break it,

494
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:28,152
I get to hit you in the nuts
three times

495
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:29,654
with a Wiffle ball bat.

496
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:34,459
Thank you... Ted.

497
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:39,330
Hey...

498
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,383
Hi, guys!

499
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:43,935
No. But you're jinxed!

500
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:46,354
I tricked Ted
into saying my name.

501
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:47,939
ALL:
Aw, come on, Ted!

502
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,774
Jinx! Jinx!
Ha-ha!

503
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:54,062
The reign of terror
is back! (evil laugh)

504
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:56,614
Hey, if you guys don't want me
to smoke

505
00:20:56,616 --> 00:20:58,349
or fart in here, just speak up.

506
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,867
Nothing? Great.

507
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,204
Thanks for the spicy
beef jerky, dude.

508
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:07,325
Anyway, I think we could
all use a little quiet.

509
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:11,028
Unless you have something
you want to talk about, Ted?

510
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:13,998
No.

511
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,667
(engine starts)

512
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,837

body in liquid form now.

00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,688
where King Kong
shows up to the opening

528
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,406
but refuses to climb
my building

529
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:01,409
because, in his words,
"It's a bit derivative."

530
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:04,045
Oh, stop it, tonight
is gonna be amazing.

531
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,081
And we are definitely gonna be
there to toast you,

532
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,634
but we might have to leave
a little early if that's okay.

533
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:12,837
My dad just gave us the most
amazing Christmas gift ever.

534
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:15,540
Our first night away
since Marvin was born.

535
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,876
24 hours straight without
that little bastard.

536
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,095
ROBIN:
Aw.

537
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:22,097
This will be a nice memory
to share with Marvin

538
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,715
when he's older
and deciding whether or not

539
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,483
to put you in a home.

540
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:26,685
Hey, we need this.

541
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:28,770
We're maximizing
our time away

542
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:31,389
by planning everything
down to the minute.

543
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,741
See?

544
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,409
2:12 p.m.-- guilt Ted

545
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,661
into saying it's okay
if we leave early tonight.

546
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:40,565
It's okay if you leave
early tonight.

547
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,566
Look, I just

548
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,168
appreciate you
showing up at all

549
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,335
on your big night away.

550
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,004
I mean, Barney's not
even gonna be there.

551
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:47,005
What?

552
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:48,707
This is the biggest
night of your career.

553
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,008
Why isn't Barney coming?

554
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,978
I don't know--
he said,

555
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,731
"Legendary" and "Challenge
accepted," and then he winked.

556
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,234
"Wait for it," you know,
all that stuff.

557
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:00,485
That does sound like him.

558
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:02,821
Well, we're your
real friends

559
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:04,856
and we wouldn't miss
it for the world.

560
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:08,042
That is why we will
see you tonight

561
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:10,795
from 7:03 to 7:14.

562
00:23:10,897 --> 00:23:13,631
Bye, guys. Good night.
Bye.

563
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:16,351
Okay, what's the real reason
Barney's not coming?

564
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:20,655
NARRATOR: <i>Here was my chance</i>
<i>to tell Robin about Barney.</i>

565
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:24,826
Yeah, actually, Barney didn't
say what he was doing tonight.

566
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:28,529
Anyway, uh, you know, I'm not
taking anyone to the opening,

567
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:30,832
so you want to be my date?

568
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,917
Sure.

569
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:37,005
Okay, Dad, I-I
made you a list

570
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:39,274
of Marvin's nightly schedule
down to the minute.

571
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:40,875
Okay.

572
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:44,512
Uh, "9:06 p.m.--
put on edible underwear."

573
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:46,714
Wrong list, wrong list.

574
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,050
Come on, relax.

575
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,936
I know this little guy
like the back of my hand.

576
00:23:51,938 --> 00:23:55,006
Dear Lord, what is that?

577
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:58,059
Oh, jam, okay.

578
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,010
Just jam.

579
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:02,030
Oh, I-I forgot
the lullaby.

580
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:03,064
Do you know
Marvin's lullaby?

581
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,565
We sing it
to him every night.

582
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,402

583

00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:02,707
Got it-- load him up
with cough syrup,

598
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,759
watch <i>Breaking Bad</i>
until he conks out.

599
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:06,594
Just kidding.

600
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:09,847
We did it.

601
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,432
Yeah, we did.

602
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:12,550
Now that we're out the door,

603
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,418
I actually don't feel anxious.

604
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
(phone rings)

605
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,687
Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad!

606
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:19,590
Oh, something horrible
happened-- aah!

607
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:21,859
Oh, it's Ted, relax.

608
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,177
Bar, now.

609
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:25,279
What is it?

610
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:26,314
He needs me.

611
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,565
But, baby, what about

612
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,367
our magical romantic night?

613
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,602
In four minutes we're supposed
to be doing hand stuff

614
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:32,987
in the cab.

615
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,039
I'll be quick--
I'm sure it's nothing huge.

616
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,240
That's huge.

617
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:38,292
Yeah, that's why Barney's
not coming tonight.

618
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:39,327
He's getting engaged.

619
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,996
And I knew that
I had to tell Robin.

620
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,131
But?

621
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:45,116
I may have, uh...

622
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:47,284
asked her to be my date instead.

623
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,303
What is wrong with me?

624
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:50,304
Deep down,

625
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:51,923
is there still
some crazy part of me

626
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,591
that thinks I'm gonna
wind up with Robin?

627
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,176
Am I that deluded?

628
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,312
If so, I need to grow up.

629
00:25:58,314 --> 00:26:00,898
Oh, um, by the way,
I'm breaking a jinx swear here,

630
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,967
so don't tell Barney
or he gets to whack me

631
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,902
in the nuts three times
with a Wiffle ball bat.

632
00:26:04,904 --> 00:26:06,354
Sure, pretty standard.

633
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,740
Robin deserves the chance to go
after Barney one last time

634
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,325
if that's what she wants.

635
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
Thanks, buddy.

636
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,078
This helped.

637
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,312
I'm gonna go tell her.

638
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:16,998
One quick thing.
Yeah.

639
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,032
Don't.

640
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:21,202
Wow.

641
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,504
Nice.

642
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:26,507
You know, now that I'm here,
I don't feel that anxious.

643
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:27,925
(phone rings)

644
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:30,094
It's my dad--
something horrible's happened!

645
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:32,964
My husband, relax.

646
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,184
Hey, um, I'm gonna be
a little while, baby.

647
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,269
It's a long story,
but Ted needs my help.

648
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:39,837
Okay, but hurry

649
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,724
or I'm gonna start doing
number 11 on my own.

650
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,028
You can do that by yourself?

651
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,847
Pilates, bitch.

652
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,766
Okay, why shouldn't
I tell Robin?

653
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:54,152
Because deep down
some crazy part of you

654
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,871
still thinks you're gonna
wind up with her, and I agree.

655
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:59,657
Marshall...
I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward.

656
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,375
Always have been,
always will be.

657
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:02,359
Now, listen.

658
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:04,462
I want my best friend
to be happy.

659
00:27:04,464 --> 00:27:06,914
And if Robin could mean
happiness for you,

660
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,834
then, dear God, why help her
go after another man?

661
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,869
Because she might still be
in love with him.

662
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:14,371
To not tell her,
to not give her that chance,

663
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:15,723
it's... it's selfish.

664
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:17,058
So be selfish.

665
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,176
I can't do that.

666
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,045
Tell that to the onion rings
we just "split."

667
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:23,214
(sighs)
Robin is my friend.

668
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:25,733
She's always been more
than that and you know it.

669
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:26,884
Now, as we speak,

670
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:30,104
my wife is in a hotel room
cheating on me...

671
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,105
with herself.

672
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,356
But I'm not
leaving here

673
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:33,691
until you promise not to say

674
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,159
a word about this to Robin.

675
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:37,361
Now repeat after me. "I..."

676
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:41,065
Well, I can do more
at a time than "I."

677
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:44,202
"I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop

678
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,537
"putting everyone else's
interests ahead of my own,

679
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,957
and for once in my life,
do what's best for me."

680
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,627
I...

681
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,546
Sorry, what was
the rest of that?

682
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,848
Hey, Dad, just taking a break

683
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,751
from our amazing night
to check in.

684
00:28:00,753 --> 00:28:05,306
I bet Marvin's pretty devastated
that I'm not there, huh?

685
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,025
Not at all-- I don't think
he even noticed you're gone.

686
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:10,094
It's kind of like Mommy who?
(laughs)

687
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:12,029
Oh... oh, good.

688
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:15,149
But I should probably sing him
his nighttime lullaby

689
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,951
over the phone, just in case.

690
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:19,070
Sang it already-- nailed it.

691
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,438
Did you do the horsie?

692
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,706
Yep.
The birdie?

693
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,007
Yep.
Elephant?

694
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,225
Yep.
Moose.

695
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:25,743
No moose, trick question.

696
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,044
Robot.

697
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:28,129
(robot voice):
Affirmative.

698
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:29,297
Look, I should go.

699
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:31,165
Marvin's asleep in my arms.

700
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,501
Mmm, his head smells like love.

701
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,886
Bye.

702
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,255
(sighs)

703
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,508
NARRATOR: <i>And so, kids,</i>
<i>on that cold December night</i>

704
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,977
<i>I decided to take</i>
<i>your Uncle Marshall's advice</i>

705
00:28:42,979 --> 00:28:44,845
<i>and be a little selfish.</i>

706
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,564
Whoa.

707
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:52,636
Hello... and
hubba-hubba.

708
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:53,688
Aw, thanks.

709
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,440
But tonight is
about my main man Mosby.

710
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:57,525
Really?
Why?

711
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,609
Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit

712
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,494
the huge thing
that's happening tonight.

713
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:03,247
Barney's getting engaged.

714
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:07,084
Ranjit out.

715
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:14,267
Bar-Barney's getting engaged?

716
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:15,685
He asked me to keep it a secret,

717
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,688
but I thought
you deserved to know...

718
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,475
in case you wanted
to do something about it.

719
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:24,077
Do you?

720
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:26,779
RANJIT:
Do you, Robin?

721
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:28,281
Ranjit, a little
privacy, please?

722
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:32,201
Sorry, not listening.

723
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:44,013
Nice, uneven floor
there, Ted.

724
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,915
(sighs)
Lily, are you drunk?

725
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,501
What? I...
I'm on vacation.

726
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:51,104
I may have cracked open
the minibar to celebrate.

727
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:52,889
Who invited the narc?

728
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,507
Hey, listen,
I know that

729
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,442
you miss Marvin, but it's not
like we could've brought him

730
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:57,810
to a black tie event anyway.

731
00:29:57,812 --> 00:30:00,446
I don't think that
they make tuxedo onesies.

732
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,518
I mean, at least not
ones that are in style.

733
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,652
I mean, a bow tie?

734
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:09,188
Is it 1998 already?

735
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,458
Yeah, these parents are
so lame and-and clingy.

736
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,994
Yeah, it's like, cut the cord
already, right, guys?

737
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:17,296
Yeah, yeah,
that baby's not even cute.

738
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:18,581
Super ugly baby.

739
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,633
It's almost
physically repulsive.

740
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,637
Aw....
Aw...

741
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:28,224
Great, I just
started lactating.

742
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,543
Me, too.

743
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:33,346
So, what do you want to do?

744
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,768
Robin, I do not
want to meddle,

745
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,188
but this is like the classic
love song says...

746
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,190
(singing loudly
and high-pitched)

747
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:48,945
Ranjit.

748
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,665
Ranjit, let's just communicate
via text from now on, okay?

749
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:56,085
(singing stops)

750
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,753
I appreciate
what you're doing.

751
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,706
But I'm not chasing
after Barney anymore.

752
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,876
I-I just got done being
crazy about all that.

753
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:07,096
I mean, why would I want to
throw myself back in that pit?

754
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,747
Because you're in love with him.

755
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:10,766
No, I'm not.

756
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,885
I'm happy for him.

757
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:16,439
So, it doesn't bother you that
Barney Stinson's gonna propose

758
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,758
to another woman on top of
the World Wide News building?

759
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
Wait, why the top
of the World Wide News building?

760
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:24,096
I guess it's Patrice's
favorite spot in the city.

761
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:27,066
Damn it, Patrice, that's my
favorite spot in the city!

762
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:30,903
Whoa.
(phone chimes)

763
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,771
Ranjit says, "Whoa."

764
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,657
Okay... (sighs)

765
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:39,111
maybe that one detail stings
a little bit,

766
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,631
but that doesn't mean
I'm in love with Barney.

767
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,882
(phone chimes)

768
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,783
"Sounds like she's
in love with Barney."

769
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:47,303
Okay, is this divider
even slightly soundproof?

770
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,754
(phone chimes)

771
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:49,922
"Yes."

772
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:52,241
With a little
winky face.

773
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,810
Look, I... I hope it goes
well for Barney.

774
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,430
I really do.

775
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,098
But tonight there is
no place I would rather be

776
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,566
than at your building.

777
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:02,401
Celebrating with you.

778
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:04,487
Are you sure?

779
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:09,492
Ranjit, to Teddy Westside's
kick-ass building.

780
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,110
I cannot hear you.

781
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:14,947
We will be there
in five minutes.

782
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:17,816
This kid does not mean
that you're special.

783
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:22,421
It just means that you're
horny and you're easy.

784
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,090
Now, come on,
let me smell his head.

785
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:27,927
Li-Lily, Lily,
no, no, no, no, come on.

786
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,497
Seriously, Ted,
what is up with the floor?

787
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,382
Lily.
What?

788
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,684
Is it harder
than we thought

789
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,502
to be away from
Marvin? Yes.

790
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:39,105
But are we gonna have fun
or are we gonna wallow

791
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:40,506
in the corner like idiots?

792
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:43,526
BOTH (crying):
♪ Night, night, little Marvin

793
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:47,063
♪ Stars twinkle for you

794
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,984
♪ The Dreamland train's
a-chuggin' ♪

795
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:53,953
♪ All your dreams

796
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:57,856
♪ Will come true.

797
00:32:57,858 --> 00:33:00,526
Hey.

798
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:04,530
Do you realize that something
you thought up in your head

799
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:08,701
now exists as a part
of the Manhattan skyline?

800
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:11,053
That's huge.

801
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,422
It's just a building.

802
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,725
I mean, I'm incredibly young
for such an achievement,

803
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,892
but it's just a building.

804
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,394
I mean, <i>Architecture</i>
<i>Vision Weekly</i>

805
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,930
may have dubbed it
"more than just a building,"

806
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,348
but it's just a building.

807
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,716
So let's not get carried...

808
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,318
Okay, you're right, it's huge.

809
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,569
It is huge.

810
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,437
You're the star of the party,
and who knows?

811
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,273
Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby
is gonna be there.

812
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:37,896
Yeah, maybe she will.

813
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:40,916
Oh.

814
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,635
Wait, this isn't your...

815
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:45,838
(sighs)

816
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,073
This is
the World Wide News building.

817
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:51,093
Go get him.

818
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:57,496
I told you,
I am done chasing Barney.

819
00:33:57,851 --> 00:33:59,851
Now can we please go
to your party?

820
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:02,737
Robin, do you want to spend
tonight making small talk

821
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:04,471
with a bunch of bankers

822
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:06,941
in a daring yet refined
contemporary masterpiece

823
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:09,360
King Kong should feel lucky
to climb...

824
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:11,863
...or do you
want to follow your heart?

825
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:15,333
Why do you keep insisting that
I have feelings for Barney?

826
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:17,502
(phone chimes)
Because you do.

827
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:19,921
See, even Ranjit agrees.

828
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:21,689
Oh, he's got to pee.

829
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:24,458
The point is,

830
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,760
you're not over Barney.

831
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:27,328
That's why you freaked out
about him proposing

832
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,163
on the roof
of the World Wide News building.

833
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,132
I did not freak out.

834
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,050
It's just...

835
00:34:33,052 --> 00:34:35,669
a teeny, tiny bit annoying

836
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:37,638
that I am the one

837
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,840
who showed her that roof
in the first place!

838
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:41,008
Damn it, Patrice!

839
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,843
Whoa.

840
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:44,228
(phone chimes)

841
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,864
"Never mind; I found
a soda bottle."

842
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:48,482
Okay, that's disturbing.

843
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:50,368
What do you want me
to do, Ted?

844
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,736
Run up to that roof,

845
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:53,454
knock the ring
out of Barney's hand,

846
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:56,908
and say, "Sorry to interrupt,
but you should be with me"?

847
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,211
Is that what you want?

848
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:02,129
No.

849
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:04,248
I don't.

850
00:35:06,134 --> 00:35:10,087
I can't keep making
an ass of myself.

851
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,540
Well,

852
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:16,427
a word in defense of making
an ass of yourself,

853
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:17,878
it's underrated.

854
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,481
Eight years ago

855
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:23,384
I made an ass
of myself chasing after you,

856
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:25,653
and I've made an ass
of myself chasing after you

857
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,321
a bunch of times since then.

858
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,057
But I have no regrets.

859
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:32,660
Because it led me to something

860
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:34,195
that I wouldn't trade
for the world.

861
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:37,731
It led to you being my friend.

862
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:41,118
So, as your friend

863
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,671
and a leading expert
in the field

864
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:45,406
of making an ass of yourself,

865
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:47,124
I say to you

866
00:35:47,126 --> 00:35:50,511
from the heart,

867
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:54,581
get the hell out of this car.

868
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,268
(exhales)

869
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,688
But, Ted,

870
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,058
your big night.

871
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:09,146
It's just a building.

872
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:21,559
(door closes)

873
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,518
BARNEY:
<i>The Robin.</i>

874
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:51,589
<i>Step one: admit to yourself</i>

875
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:53,557
<i>that you still have feelings</i>
<i>for this girl.</i>

876
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,361
I am hopelessly,
irretrievably in love with her.

877
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:00,164
More than she knows.

878
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,949
<i>Step two:</i>

879
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,001
<i>choose the completely wrong</i>
<i>moment to make a drunken move</i>

880
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:05,086
<i>after hanging out</i>

881
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:08,289
<i>at a strip club</i>

882
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,675
<i>and get shot down on purpose.</i>

883
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:14,378
<i>Step three:</i>

884
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,098
<i>agree that you two don't work,</i>
<i>locking the door</i>

885
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,833
<i>on any future</i>
<i>you could have together.</i>

886
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:20,634
I'm done trying to get you.

887
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:22,970
I can't do it anymore.

888
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,671
<i>Which will drive Robin nuts.</i>

889
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:25,923
Huh.

890
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:28,943
<i>Step four:</i>

891
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:31,145
<i>Robin goes nuts.</i>

892
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:32,997
<i>Step five:</i>

893
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:35,182
<i>find the person</i>
<i>who annoys Robin most</i>

894
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:36,150
<i>in the world...</i>

895
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:39,403
Nobody asked
for your help, Patrice!

896
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:42,673
<i>...and ask for her help.</i>

897
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:44,992
Oh, hi, Barney.

898
00:37:44,994 --> 00:37:46,127
What are you doing here?

899
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,745
Actually, I'm looking for you.

900
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:50,047
This may sound kind of weird,
but I have a proposition...

901
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:52,216
<i>Explain everything to Patrice</i>

902
00:37:52,218 --> 00:37:54,085
<i>and hope she agrees to help.</i>

903
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:55,869
Yay. I love Robin.

904
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,005
Of course I'll help.
(giggles)

905
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,557
Good, good.
(screams)

906
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,759
<i>Step six:</i>
<i>check with your doctor</i>

907
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,877
<i>about possible broken ribs.</i>

908
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:06,680
<i>Step seven:</i>
<i>pretend to be dating Patrice.</i>

909
00:38:06,682 --> 00:38:10,017
Nobody asked you here,
Patrice!

910
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:12,820
Actually, I did.

911
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:14,105
<i>Step eight:</i>

912
00:38:14,107 --> 00:38:16,407
<i>wait until Robin inevitably</i>
<i>breaks into your place</i>

913
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:18,409
<i>to find the Playbook</i>
<i>and show it to Patrice,</i>

914
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:20,694
<i>which you'll monitor</i>
<i>via the hidden cameras</i>

915
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:23,397
<i>you have in your apartment.</i>

916
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:29,069
Patrice, the robin's
in the nest.

917
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:32,673
That means Robin broke
into my apartment

918
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:34,508
Were you even listening
when I explained the codes?

919
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,460
<i>Step nine: after Patrice</i>
<i>finds the Playbook,</i>

920
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:39,597
<i>have your first big fight.</i>

921
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,182
This is going so well.

922
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,416
Thank you so much.

923
00:38:42,418 --> 00:38:45,085
I know, but what the heck
are Lily and Ted doing here?

924
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,104
I don't know.
My friends have no boundaries.

925
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:49,056
(groans)
How can I ever thank you?

926
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:50,941
Will you watch my
cat next weekend?

927
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:52,476
No.

928
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:55,112
Come on, we should probably
go back inside.

929
00:38:55,114 --> 00:38:56,781
<i>Step ten:</i>

930
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:58,282
<i>prove your loyalty to Patrice</i>

931
00:38:58,284 --> 00:38:59,933
<i>by burning the Playbook,</i>

932
00:38:59,935 --> 00:39:01,819
<i>and actually burn it.</i>

933
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:06,157
<i>You don't need it anymore.</i>

934
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:08,775
<i>Step 11:</i>

935
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:10,377
<i>because your friends</i>
<i>have no boundaries,</i>

936
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:11,879
<i>they'll inevitably have</i>

937
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:13,330
<i>an intervention for Robin,</i>

938
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:15,282
<i>which you'll monitor</i>
<i>via the hidden cameras</i>

939
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:16,884
<i>you have in Marshall</i>
<i>and Lily's apartment.</i>

940
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:18,586
<i>Step 12:</i>

941
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:19,887
<i>tell only Ted about your plan</i>

942
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,455
<i>to propose to Patrice.</i>

943
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:23,474
You can't tell anybody.

944
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:25,226
Agreed?

945
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,462
<i>Step 13:</i>

946
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:30,147
<i>wait and see</i>
<i>if Ted tells Robin,</i>

947
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:31,799
<i>and if he does...</i>

948
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,400
Barney's getting engaged.

949
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:35,186
<i>...it means your best bro</i>
<i>in the world</i>

950
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:38,355
<i>has let go of Robin</i>
<i>and has given you his blessing.</i>

951
00:39:38,357 --> 00:39:41,442
<i>Step 14:</i>
<i>Robin arrives</i>

952
00:39:41,444 --> 00:39:43,244
<i>at her favorite spot</i>
<i>in the city</i>

953
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:44,612
<i>and finds the secret final page</i>

954
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:47,414
<i>of the Playbook.</i>

955
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:49,033
<i>The last play</i>

956
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:50,817
<i>you'll ever run.</i>

957
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:53,254
<i>Step 15: Robin realizes</i>

958
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:55,873
<i>she's standing</i>
<i>underneath mistletoe.</i>

959
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:05,799
(sighs)

960
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:07,000
Seriously, Barney?

961
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:09,220
Even you,

962
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:12,806
even someone
as certifiably insane as you

963
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:15,226
must realize
that this is too far.

964
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:17,945
You lied to me,

965
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,730
manipulated me for weeks.

966
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:22,182
Do you really think I could
ever kiss you after that?

967
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:23,350
Do you really think

968
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:25,953
I could ever trust you
after that?

969
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:26,904
This...

970
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:28,489
this is proof

971
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:29,657
of why we don't work,

972
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:31,158
why we'll never work.

973
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,577
So thank you.

974
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:35,696
You've set me free because...

975
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:38,865
how could I be with a man
who thinks that this...

976
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:41,468
trick, this enormous lie

977
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,971
could ever make me want
to date him again?

978
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:46,857
Turn it over.

979
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,042
(sighs)

980
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,384
Robin Scherbatsky...

981
00:40:58,353 --> 00:41:00,554
...will you marry me?

982
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:08,462
Yes.
