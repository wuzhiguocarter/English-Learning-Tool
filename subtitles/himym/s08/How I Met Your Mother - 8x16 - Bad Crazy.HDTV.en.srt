<i>Kids, early in this</i>
<i>story, you may recall me saying</i>

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:06,131
<i>something along</i>
<i>the lines of...</i>

3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,268
Okay, no more dating.

4
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:09,952
I am ready to settle down.

5
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:12,471
<i>And at the time,</i>
<i>I probably thought I meant it.</i>

6
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>But, kids, I'll be honest.</i>

7
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:16,491
<i>Being single's fun.</i>

8
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:19,311
<i>As a young unattached man</i>
<i>in New York City,</i>

9
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:20,712
<i>I had a great time.</i>

10
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:22,981
<i>A great time.</i>

11
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:25,317
<i>What was I saying? Oh, yeah.</i>

12
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:28,186
<i>I had such a great time that</i>
<i>it took someone very special</i>

13
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:30,105
to make me want to settle down.

14
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:32,608
<i>And that someone...</i>

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,277
<i>was Jeanette.</i>

16
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,913
What made Jeanette so special?
<i>Well...</i>

17
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,665
That was a foul!

18
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,751
<i>Jeanette was the last girl</i>
<i>I dated</i>

19
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:44,036
<i>before I met your mother.</i>

20
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,004
<i>The girl who finally got me</i>

21
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,206
No more dating.

22
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,453
I'm ready to settle down.

28
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:11,065
She broke your TV
with a beer bottle?

29
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,434
In her defense,
she was aiming for the window.

30
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:15,403
Dude, you gotta get rid
of this girl.

31
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:17,522
Agreed.
Cray-cray gotta go bye-bye

Oh, really?

34
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:22,610
And are you guys saying this
because you don't want me

35
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:24,712
to be with Jeanette,
or because you want me

36
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:27,398

You know what, Ted?
That reminds me.

46
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:11,959
I just bought this
antique Swiss clock,

47
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,445
but Robin won't let us put it
in the apartment,

48
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:17,114
so I was gonna leave it
at your place.

49
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,416
Only problem? It's broken.

50
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:21,252
So I was just gonna sit here
and try to fix it

51
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,338
while maybe you tell us what you
and Jeanette did last night?

52
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,974
Okay. Well, uh, Jeanette
is a big Marilyn Monroe fan.

53
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:30,761
There you go!
Now it's working!

54
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:32,930
Sorry. Sorry. Go on. Go on.
She's a Marilyn Monroe fan

55
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:34,765
so I guess you watched
one of her movies?

56
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,435
Uh, No, we had a séance.

57
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:40,488
Look at that! Good as new.

58
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,641
Anyway, were you able
to contact Marilyn

59
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,443
in the spirit world?

60
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,912
No. We talked to her cat.

61
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,917
Screw loose!
That's the problem.

62
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,785
Uh-oh.

63
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:55,953
Looks like somebody's
hungry.

64
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:57,538
I'm gonna get
his food ready.

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,007
Robin, can you grab him?

66
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,211
Can I? Try and stop me!

00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:05,163
<i>Now, kids,</i>
<i>what Lily didn't realize--</i>

68
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,698
<i>what none of us realized,</i>
<i>in fact-- was that</i>

69
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,034
in the eight months since your
<i>cousin Marvin was born,</i>

70
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,969
Robin had never once held him.

71
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:15,172
<i>The truth was, the thought</i>
<i>of holding him terrified her,</i>

72
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:18,526
<i>so she had always avoided it,</i>
<i>ever so discreetly.</i>

73
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:19,977
Can you hold...
Oh, shoot! Look at that!

74
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,613
Oh, geez.

75
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:23,948
I got him.

76
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,533
Come here,
you little munchkin.

77
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,017
Aw, man...

78
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,403
Oh, well, I call next.

79
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:32,957
Well, I should go. It's time
for Jeanette's... something.

80
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,743
Time for Jeanette's what, Ted?

81
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:39,747
Uh, we're taking her dog
to an exorcist.

82
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:42,633
Wow, Ted, that sounds...

83
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:49,873
Crap, it's really broken now.

84
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:52,476
Okay, fine. I admit it.
She's crazy.

85
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,594
Obviously.

86
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:56,097
But I'm not in this
for the long haul.

87
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,881
It's just, you know,
it's just fun.

88
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,934
Of course it's fun, <i>at first.</i>

89
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:02,320
But then when she starts calling
out the name of her

90
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:05,055
high school science teacher
in the throes of passion,

91
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:06,574
it's really fun.

92
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:09,660
But then when she starts
bringing knives into bed

93
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:12,496
and making you fear
for your safety?

94
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,248
It's really, <i>really</i> fun.

95
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,118
But then when she starts
unbuttoning your pants

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,238
while you're being forced
to drive blindfolded

97
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,110
down the freeway
with a gun pointed at your...

98
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,596
I'm sorry,
what were we talking about?

99
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,597
Jeanette.

100
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:30,715
Oh, right. That girl's crazy.

101
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,100
You gotta break up with her.
I know.

102
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:35,603
I know. You're right.
I-I have to break up with her.

103
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:37,588
I should do it
in a public place, though,

104
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,023
so she doesn't flip out.

105
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:41,609
<i>So the next night,</i>
<i>I met her in a public place</i>

106
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:42,944
<i>so she wouldn't flip out.</i>

107
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:44,278
I will kill you, ref!

108
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,530
I will kill you in front
of all these people!

109
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:48,282
Oh, boy.
What, you think I won't

110
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:49,951
just 'cause I'm in
a public place?!

111
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:52,936
I'll go to jail for the rest
of my life if I have to!

112
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,492
Listen, before the game starts,
I think we need to talk.

113
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:00,277
I can't believe
Ted's dead.

114
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,545
I know.

115
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,080
What a way to go.

116
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:04,749
Killed by a bazooka.

117
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:08,886
All right, all right,
so I'm not on my game today.

118
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:10,004
Anyway...

119
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:12,340
I gotta hop out for a bit.

120
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:13,557
You guys stay here.

121
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:16,477
Oh, and, um,
if Jeanette comes by,

122
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,629
do not let her into
the apartment.

123
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:20,297
Don't let her in. Got it.

124
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,966
Guys, this is serious.
This girl is like bedbugs.

125
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,603
Once she's in the apartment,
there's no getting her out.

126
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:28,489
Ted, buddy,

127
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,191
how long have we been dealing

128
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:33,244
with Barney's insane
girlfriends? Years.

129
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,246
Nigh on a decade!

130
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:38,449
I had to testify
in five competency hearings.

131
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,785
I think we can handle Jeanette.

132
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:42,370
Okay, okay.

133
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,372
See you soon.

134
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,876
That kid. Am I right?

135
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,963
Now look who forgot his keys.

136
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:56,684
What is it?

137
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:03,190
<i>Meanwhile, Lily and Robin</i>
<i>were out getting lunch,</i>

138
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,559
<i>when disaster struck.</i>

139
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,845
Oh, God, I left his binky
on that bus!

140
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,346
Wait. Don't you have
other binkies?

141
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:11,065
That one's his favorite!
He'll know the difference!

142
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,317
I'm not gonna let
this be the reason

143
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,402
he resents me later in life!

144
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:17,688
If he starts crying,
just pick him up!

145
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,876
What? Uh, uh...

146
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:26,664
Okay, okay.
Yeah,  there, there, there. Okay.

147
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,500
Hey, I'm back.
Did I miss anything?

148
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:30,885
Nope.

149
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:31,869
Did Jeanette come by?

150
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,003
Jeanette? I know
lots of Jeanettes.

151
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:34,922
Um...

152
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:36,691
Guys!
Okay, she came by

153
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,726
because she forgot
her book.

154
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:41,512
So we let her go up
in your room and get it.

155
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,213
And then?

156
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:44,982
And then what?

157
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:47,318
And then she left?

158
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,272
I think she left.

159
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:55,710
Are you sure she left?

160
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:59,413
I am... 90% sure...

161
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,365
that she left.

162
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,502
80 percent.

163
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,171
Actually, I'm gonna
change my answer.

164
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:09,406
I am now starting to
think she never left,

165
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:13,627
and instead she barricaded
herself in your room.

166
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,379
And I'm never coming out!

167
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:18,349
A hundred percent.

168
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,398
I cannot believe
you guys!

169
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:27,762
Well, maybe if you had given us
a warning that she was crazy!

170
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,522
Dude, it's okay.

171
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,358
She can't stay
in there forever.

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,911
She'll have to come out
to eat and drink

173
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,579
and go to the bathroom, right?

174
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,498
<i>Now, a few months earlier,</i>

175
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,100
<i>the East Coast had been hit</i>
<i>by a bad storm,</i>

176
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,102
<i>and some intelligent,</i>
<i>forward-thinking</i>

177
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,204
<i>New Yorkers took it</i>
<i>as a wake-up call,</i>

178
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,423
<i>making sure to stock</i>

179
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,674
food and water to last months,

180
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,426
not to mention a portable waste
<i>management system.</i>

181
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,828
<i>It was really</i>
<i>the smart thing to do.</i>

182
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:54,882
You dumbass!

183
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:58,635
Really, Ted. How could you be so
unbelievably stupid?

184
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:01,004
No, no, you guys are the ones
who invited

185
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:03,974
a vampire into my apartment!
This is your fault!

186
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,559
And P.S., if this disaster

187
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:08,028
had been a superstorm
instead of a hot lunatic,

188
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,731
you'd all be begging to eat
my freeze-dried protein paste

189
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,700
and crap in my biohazard bucket.
Just sayin'.

190
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,768
I got it.

191
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,370
It was on the
floor of the bus.

192
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:20,023
I should
probably throw it out. Eh.

193
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,292
Did he give you any problems?

194
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,745
He cried a little,
but then he stopped.

195
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:27,965
Oh, good.
Anything else happen?

196
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,366
Nope.

197
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:31,885
That... is... it.

198
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:35,923
All gone!

199
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,641
We have to do this more often.

200
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,226
Oh, we totally do.

201
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,011
I can't believe Marvin's
in kindergarten.

202
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:42,980
He's growing up so fast.

203
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,566
Can I confess something to you?

204
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:49,236
Remember the day you left
Marvin's binky on the bus

205
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,022
and you left me alone with him?
Yeah.

206
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:55,058
Well, I didn't tell you this
at the time, but...

207
00:08:56,412 --> 00:09:00,447
Okay, okay.
Yeah, there, there, there.

208
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,731
Okay, shh, shh.

209
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:05,568
Oh, no, it looks like
somebody's not happy.

210
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,920
No kidding.
I'm miserable.

211
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,188
Listen to this thing.

212
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,091
He probably just wants
to be held.

213
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,676
I think you're right.

214
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,761
Can you do it?

215
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,597
All right.

216
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,582
Come here, handsome. Oh.
Yeah.

217
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,184
Yes.

218
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,936
Oh.

219
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,422
I let a stranger pick up Marvin.
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,357
It's just, I hadn't actually
picked him up

221
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,226
at that point,
and I was scared, so...

222
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,528
You know what?
It was four years ago.

223
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,865
He's obviously fine.
Don't even worry about it.

224
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,316
Really?
Yeah.

225
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,151
Thank you.

226
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:41,271
I mean, as long as there's
not more to that story.

227
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:45,409
Nope. That... is... it.

228
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,379
Jeanette, you
have to leave!

229
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,414
In a minute!

230
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,582
I still haven't
found that book!

231
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:55,802
Listen, Jeanette,
I didn't want to do this,

232
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,121
but I called the police.
They're on their way.

233
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,806
All units, all units.

234
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,391
Possible 10-90 in progress

235
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,428
at 521 West 82nd,
apartment 15.

236
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,846
Where's that coming from?

237
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:07,297
Is that you, Dolores?

238
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,349
Jeanette?
Hey, girl. How you been?

239
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,902
Oh, you know, I'm just doing me.

240
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,571
Anyway, I'll check out
that 10-90.

241
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,657
Okay, but remember...

242
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,408
I know, no excessive force.

243
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,078
Last thing I need is another
suspension, am I right?

244
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,247
<i>And that, kids,</i>
<i>was how I found out</i>

245
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,216
what Jeanette did for a living.

246
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,168
Wait a second.

247
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,153
Is she a cop?!

248
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:31,204
I think she's a cop!

249
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,873
Did you know
she was a cop?!

250
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,175
I didn't know
she was a <i>cop!</i>

251
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,595
Ted, I'm sorry I have to say
this-- Jeanette lives here now.

252
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,797
This is her place.
You're gonna have to leave.

253
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,798
What?

254
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,849
Why don't you have to leave?

255
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,434
They can stay.

256
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,521
Thank you, Officer Jeanette.
Thank you, Officer Jeanette.

257
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,673
All gone.

258
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,025
We need to do this more often.

259
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,310
We totally do.
I can't believe

260
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:54,811
Marvin's in middle school.

261
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,113
Oh, he's growing up so fast.

262
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:59,282
Can I confess something to you?

263
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,068
Remember that day
you left Marvin's binky

264
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,487
on the bus and I let
that old lady pick him up?

265
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:06,456
I seem to recall
that was the entire story.

266
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,792
There's a little bit more.

267
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,360
There, there, little one.

268
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:13,296
Let's put you back
in your strolly-poo,

269
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,967
so you can drift off
to dreamy-dreamy land.

270
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:20,420
Oh, thank you
so much.

271
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,089
Yeah, this is my first time
alone with him,

272
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,641
and, you know, um, I have this
weird feeling that I'm gonna,

273
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,344
I don't know, like, drop him
or injure him in some way,

274
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:28,979
which is completely insane.

275
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,647
But...
Oh, heavens.

276
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,815
Oh, my God!

277
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,566
Oh, my God.

278
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,484
I know, I'm so sorry.

279
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,902
Well, you know what?

280
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,321
That was what, 12 years ago?

281
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,906
Don't even worry about it.

282
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,158
Really?
Yeah.

283
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,360
Oh, thank you.

284
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:46,113
Just promise me
there's no more to that story.

285
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:50,167
Nope, that is it.

286
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,903
Are you sure
you want to do this?

287
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,088
The girl's a cop.

288
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,009
Yeah, this seems
like a really bad idea.

289
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,410
I don't care.

290
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,679
I am going into
that bedroom

291
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,131
because this is my home

292
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,433
and I have to defend it.

293
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,218
But mostly because

294
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,086
my allergy medication

295
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,422
is in there!

296
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,090
All right, just
be careful, okay?

297
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,809
This girl is
really crazy.

298
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:19,095
Yeah, why can't she just accept
the fact that you guys broke up?

299
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,982
I know, I know, why can't
she just accept that?

300
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,900
Why, it's, like, why?

301
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:29,105
It might be because
we didn't actually break up.

302
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,624
Aw, man.

303
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,577
Jeanette, come on,
that's vintage vinyl.

304
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,184
Ted, did you
or didn't you break up

305
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:41,766
with Jeanette last night?

306
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:44,736
I don't know,
it's kind of confusing.

307
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:47,089
I think we need to talk.

308
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,491
Oh, oh, okay.

309
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,326
I see where this is going.

310
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,328
You're in love with Lily.

311
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,496
That's it, isn't it?

312
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:56,381
What? No, I...

313
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:59,117
Like I should be surprised
with her fancy medical degree

314
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,386
and her sexy Southern drawl.

315
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:02,638
What? She's not...

316
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,256
Don't talk to me,
don't look at me.

317
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:07,142
I hate you and I never
want to see you again!

318
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,145
And then things got crazy

319
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:12,814
and we got thrown out
of the Barclays Center.

320
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:16,068
I don't know, it felt
pretty breakup-y.

321
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,969
Mm.
Anyway,

322
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,656
we parted on pretty
bad terms, so...

323
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,241
I kind of thought maybe
I could...

324
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:24,776
Never contact her again
and hope she'd take

325
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:26,478
the hint and just
leave you alone?

326
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,030
Barney, give me some credit.

327
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,582
Was that the plan?
Yes.

328
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:34,119
All gone.
We need to do this more often.

329
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,253
We totally do.

330
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:36,538
I can't believe Marvin's
in high school.

331
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,655
He's growing up so fast.

332
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,624
Can I confess something to you?
Oh, no. What?

333
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,825
What happened?

334
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,961
Tell me what you did to my son.

335
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,848
This is not going
well at all.

336
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,283
Oh, honey, you are shaking.

337
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,935
Let's get you out
of the cold.

338
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,937
What's open near here?

339
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,772
♪

340
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:58,676
You took my infant child
to a strip club?

341
00:13:58,678 --> 00:13:59,895
It was just topless.

342
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,863
He saw yours
all the time anyway.

343
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:03,799
Okay, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have done that,

344
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,701
but that is all there is.

345
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,402
Okay, there is no more
to the story.

346
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,204
I have now told you everything.

347
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:11,440
<i>All gone.</i>

348
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,992
We need to do this more often.
We totally do.

349
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,660
I can't believe
Marvin's driving.

350
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:16,962
He's growing up so fast.

351
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:18,380
Okay, there's one other thing.

352
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:19,548
What?

353
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,666
Well, I have to go use
the ladies' room.

354
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:23,552
Can you watch him for me?

355
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,702
Of course.

356
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,471
I could just eat you up.

357
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:30,542
You left him
with a complete stranger?

358
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,876
He could've been...

359
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,478
Robin, how could you?
Lily,

360
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,564
please, okay,
it was 16 years ago.

361
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,816
He's fine.

362
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,184
You're right.

363
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:41,219
It's fine.

364
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:45,273
God, it feels so good to have
gotten this off my chest.

365
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,442
Finally it is all on the table.

366
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:50,112
All secrets are exposed
and there is nothing left

367
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:51,663
to be revealed.

368
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,116
All gone.
We need to do this more...

369
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,867
There's more to the story.
Damn it, Robin.

370
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:57,869
What could you possibly
have left out?

371
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:00,422
It's just there's, um,

372
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:05,427
one little detail that
I may have slightly altered.

373
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,546
If he starts crying,
just pick him up.

374
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:13,552
Yeah, there, there.

375
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,470
Come on,
buddy, shh.

376
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:17,522
Looks like
somebody's unhappy.

377
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,191
No kidding, I'm miserable.

378
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,609
Listen to this thing.

379
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:22,110
Maybe he needs to be held.

380
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:24,362
I think you're right.

381
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:26,198
Can you do it?

382
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,566
Sure.

383
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:28,933
Come here, handsome.

384
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:30,485
Come here, come here,
you handsome devil, you.

385
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:31,736
You're such a beautiful...

386
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:33,205
Aw, you're such
a cool dude.

387
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,874
Oh, look at you, oh.

388
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,576
All right, there, there,
little one, there, there.

389
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,961
Let me put you back
in your strolly-poo

390
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:43,114
so you can drift off
to dreamy-dreamy land.

391
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,083
Okay? All right.

392
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,134
Thank you so much.

393
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:47,219
Hey, don't worry about it.

394
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,336
It's my first time
alone with him,

395
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,554
and I just have
this weird feeling

396
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:50,839
I'm gonna drop him

397
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,007
or injure him in some way.

398
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:53,175
I know it's completely
insane...

399
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:54,392
Oh, heavens, oh,
watch it, no!

400
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:55,760
No!

401
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,431
This is not going well at all.

402
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,767
Oh, hon, you're shaking.

403
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:03,735
Let's get out
of the cold.

404
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,487
Is there anything open
near here?

405
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:08,473
♪

406
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:12,194
Hey, I need to go to the ladies'
room-- can you watch him for me?

407
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,446
Of course.
I could just eat you up.

408
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:16,581
Look at you,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

409
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,869
You waited 17 years to tell me

410
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:24,089
that you met the greatest boxer
of all time?

411
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:28,460
My son was rocked to sleep
by Senator Mike Tyson?

412
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,929
I wanted to tell you, believe me.
How could you...?

413
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:33,098
Okay, this is the
right thing to do.

414
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,884
You got to go up there and
break up with her for real.

415
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,669
And don't worry,
if anything happens,

416
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:39,688
just scream,
we'll come rescue you.

417
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,356
Okay.

418
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,410
Did you guys not hear me
screaming up there?

419
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,629
Aw, I feel so awful.

420
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,797
We went to get subs.

421
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,499
We got you one though.

422
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,551
We didn't get you one.

423
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:12,337
So, Jeanette's squatting
in your room?

424
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,955
What are you guys doing here?

425
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:16,174
We heard you screaming
from three blocks away.

426
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:17,309
Why is she in there?

427
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,261
Lily, there is no reason why.

428
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:21,513
That's like asking
why is the earth round?

429
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:23,381
Why does the sun come up
in the morning?

430
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,849
What do I do for a living?

431
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:27,686
There are some questions we're
not meant to know the answer to.

432
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:30,989
Crazy girls are crazy
because they're crazy.

433
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,191
I-I don't think it's
quite that simple.

434
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:34,359
I was talking

435
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,244
to a friend of mine
about Ted and Jeanette.

436
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,229
Oh, great, what
friend is this?

437
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:42,150
Uh, just this wise
old lady that I know.

438
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:43,485
Here's the thing
about crazy.

439
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,837
When a guy sends mixed
signals to a girl,

440
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,390
it takes a toll on her
psychological well-being.

441
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,926
You want to know why
a girl acts crazy,

442
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,510
look at the guy she's dating.

443
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,412
Then you really see some crazy.

444
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:56,348
Trust me.

445
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,435
Are you Mike Tyson?

446
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:01,469
Now, hold on.

447
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,921
I've dated tons
of crazy girls in my life,

448
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:08,426
and not once have I ever treated
them with anything other than...

449
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,811
Oh, right, I'm a monster.

450
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:13,064
Maybe the old lady
with the face tattoo is right.

451
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,933
Maybe the reason Jeanette's
acting this way

452
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,202
is Ted.

453
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:19,154
Me? How is this my fault?

454
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:21,456
Yeah, come on, this is Ted
we're talking about.

455
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,575
I'm sure he didn't do anything
to lead her on

456
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:26,077
or send mixed signals,
right, Ted?

457
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:29,247
Don't talk to me,
don't look at me.

458
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:32,250
I hate you and I never
want to see you again!

459
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:39,641
And we got thrown out
of the Barclays Center.

460
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:41,259
Okay, that's disappointing.

461
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,927
So disappointing.

462
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,897
Seriously.

463
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:47,899
But that was last night.
I mean, it's not like...

464
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,186
Listen, Jeanette, we really need

465
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:52,854
to have a serious talk
about our...

466
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:56,274
So, did Lily leave
these boots here

467
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,410
or was it some other bitch?

468
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,649
Marshall, Barney, help me!

469
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:07,118
I don't think they're coming.

470
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,937
I guess not.

471
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:15,159
It's those red boots.

472
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:17,128
They just look sexy
on everyone.

473
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,681
Okay, Ted,
what is with the red boots?

474
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:21,883
You're a smart guy,
you've got some taste,

475
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:23,385
you got a visual sense, I mean,

476
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,169
you're an architect
for Pete's sakes.

477
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,055
How can you look at
those boots and think...

478
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,507
Oh, my God, I'm holding it,
I'm holding the baby.

479
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,942
What, you've never
held him before?

480
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,677
Uh, tons of times.

481
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,613
This-this is not a
big moment for me.

482
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,115
This is exhilarating.

483
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:41,653
Look, yes, I know what
you're gonna say.

484
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:43,705
I have to break up with her.
No,

485
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:45,857
I was actually gonna
say the opposite.

486
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,293
I think you need to be
with Jeanette right now.

487
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,194
Because she's the one.

488
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:51,379
No. What? No.

489
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,331
She's insane.

490
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,167
But I think you are also
a little insane right now.

491
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,536
So I think
you need to go

492
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:01,556
be with your crazy girl for a
while and when it all goes down

493
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,758
in flames-- and I don't mean
that figuratively,

494
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,810
I expect there
to be actual flames...

495
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,679
<i>And there were.</i>

496
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,065
...we'll be here for you
because we love you.

497
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,721
Jeanette I just want
to say that, uh,

498
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:19,240
you going through
my stuff like that...

499
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,695
You are really
something special.

500
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:28,199
I'm gonna send Lily
a dead animal in the mail.

501
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,419
I think I'm falling for you.

502
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,289
I think we should have
a three-way with my therapist.

503
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,924
He's 70.

504
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:38,676
What is your ring size?

505
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,656
Robin.

506
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:50,646
It's 3:00 in the morning.

507
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:51,563
Really?

508
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:53,347
Yeah, you sure you
don't want to just

509
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,484
put him in the crib and,
you know, go home?

510
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:58,319
No, I'm good.

511
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,321
Okay.

512
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,406
Good night.

513
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:02,690
Good night.
