My dad made the funniest joke.

22
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:47,498
He said that since you're
the reason I left the wedding,

23

you owe him the $70,000
he paid for it,

sitting at home planning

I keep reassuring Lily
that this is all hypothetical.

90
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,099
Relatively speaking,
New York City is very safe.

91
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:55,385
Please, faulty elevators,

it in a mugging gone wrong.

00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,695
There was a double hommy
on your block like a week ago.

Anyway,

101
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:16,456
then we got to the section
about picking a guardian.

102
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,826
Sometimes couples choose one
of their parents as a guardian.

103
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:21,745
That makes it simple.

104
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:22,946
My mom.

105
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:24,447
Your mom?

106
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:25,999
What's wrong with my mom?

107
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,067

108
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,006
Fine. All right.

109
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:35,842
Marvin won't go
to my loving mother.

110
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:37,010
But he's got to go to somebody.

111
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:38,628
Fine.

112
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,796
What about my mom?

113
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,231

114
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,816

116
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:53,493

117
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:54,494

118
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:56,063

119
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:57,480
Okay, yeah, he's out.

120
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:00,117
Wait a minute.
You know who could be good?

121
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,568
My brother Marcus.

122
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,587
He's like a great dad.

123
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:04,821
Do you remember
his Christmas card?

124
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:12,179
Questionable denim choices
aside, Marcus is a good dad.

125
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:15,682
I guess if Marvin has to go
to anyone, it should be family.

126
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:17,467
Okay, great.

127
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:18,969

00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:23,223
Pretty freaking sweet, buttwipe.

130
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:27,077

"See ya" to Sarah and the kids;

131
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,979

133
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:33,633

142
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,423

to inspect your bundle of joy,

179
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:52,205
you can inspect
their bundles of joy.

180
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:53,840
The Broller.

181
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,542
God, I come up
with a lot of good stuff.

182
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,010
Hey, guys, hey...

183
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,011
Hey.

184
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,829
Lily and I need you
to come upstairs.

185
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:01,348
This is an important decision

186
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,350
and we can't have you
constantly interrupting us

187
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:05,435
with this childish competition.

188
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:08,638
Which is why
we're going to make it

189
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,341
an official competition!

190
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:13,676
We're going to play
<i>Who Wants to Be a Godparent?</i>

191
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:16,496
Right after this word
from our sponsors.

192
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:20,867
Why is he talking
to the wall?

193
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,525
Wait, this is how you're going
to choose a guardian for Marvin?

194
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,142
I mean, why don't
you just put us

195
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,677
in a three-way cage match and
go with whoever's left standing?

196
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,964
We talked about that, but it
gave Robin an unfair advantage.

197
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:38,066
Yeah, you see,
guys, we were

198
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,052
really struggling
with this decision.

199
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:42,137
♪ All through the town. ♪

200
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,974
Babe, I know
these guys have been

201
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:48,527
- a little over the top lately.
- A little?

202
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,564
But we still have to pick
a guardian just in case.

203
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,665
In case of what?

204
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,200
Don't make me say it.

205
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,585
Say it. I can handle it.

206
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:57,586
Say it.

207
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:59,588
In case we die.

208
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,527
How can you even say it?

209
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,045
<i>And then I thought</i>
<i>what do you do</i>

210
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,964
<i>if you got</i> <i>a wife</i>
<i>who won't stop crying,</i>

211
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,716
<i>three idiots</i>
<i>who won't stop bribing you,</i>

212
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,337
<i>and a universally beloved</i>
<i>skill for gamesmanship?</i>

213
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,472
You take a bunch
of guardianship scenarios,

214
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,691
throw them on a wheel,
buy your wife an expensive dress

215
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:20,675
so she'll participate.

216
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:22,227
I'm pretty again.

217
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,845
Bottom line is
I just wanted

218
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:26,148
to make the idea
of me and Lily dying...

219
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,849
fun.
Oh.

220
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,734
Now, if you'll step behind
your podiums, we'll get started.

221
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,756
Contestants,

222
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:35,874
here's how the game works.

223
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,243
Lily will spin that wheel.
Not yet.

224
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,162
When it lands
on a parenting issue,

225
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:43,965
you'll each describe how
you would handle it with Marvin.

226
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:45,750
The contestant with the
highest score gets to be

227
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,968
his godparent.

228
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,753
Ready to play?
Great. Lily,

229
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,589
spin that wheel!

230
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:57,596
Okay, now, see, um, enthusiasm
will factor into your scores.

231
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,814
So, I say again:

232
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,432
Lily, spin...

233
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,050
Spin that wheel!

234
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:05,887
♪ ♪

235
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,608
Ooh.

236
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,725
Our demise.

237
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,995
Barney, how would you

238
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:18,567
explain to little Marvin
why we're not around anymore?

239
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,902
No.

240
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,622
Easy, all I'd have to do
is change a few words

241
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,891
to one of my classics
with the ladies.

242
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,844
The President of the World
has called your parents away

243
00:10:28,846 --> 00:10:30,846
on a super-secret
space mission.

244
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:34,599
For the sake of the planet,
you will never see them again.

245
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,085
Now pick up your toys
and say good night to Daddy.

246
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,354
What do you know?
That last line stays the same.

247
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,422
Judges?

248
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,141
Okay, Robin,

249
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,693
what would you do, and remember,

250
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:46,528
"President of the World
called parents away

251
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,397
for a super-secret space
mission" has already been taken.

252
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,551
Well, my dad was always upfront
and honest with me,

253
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,486
so that's how I would be.

254
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,405
All right, kid, here's
the deal with the deal.

255
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,623
Your mom and dad are <i>done-ski.</i>

256
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,292
Belly-flopped
off a subway platform.

257
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:02,961
Mom busted open like a piñata.

258
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,647
What was left of your dad
hung around for a few days.

259
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:07,132
Anyway, plug's pulled.
Organs donated.

260
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,968
Long story short: I'm your
new mommy now. (chuckles)

261
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,053
Sah-wish!

262
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:17,292
Well, I was saving these
for the showcase,

263
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:20,011
but here.
Hey, Lily, look, baby,

264
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,513
his-and-her watches.

265
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,882
Ooh.

266
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,369
Ted, the category's all yours.

267
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:29,287
Okay, here's what I would say.

268
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,657
Well, Marvin, explaining
where your parents are

269
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,858
isn't gonna be easy.

270
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,496
Even I-- Lily and Marshall's
best friend

271
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:42,150
for almost 20 years--

272
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:45,754
will have
a hard time doing it.

273
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:50,592
But I do know a guy who's very
good at this sort of thing.

274
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:53,929
Professor Infosaurus!

275
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,298
Hey, there, squirt!

276
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,620
Death is a difficult
yet unfortunate certainty.

277
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:04,172
Good enough!
Ted wins the round!

278
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:05,807
Yes! Yes!
You'll see.

279
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,060
Professor Infosaurus will be
a big, big hit with children.

280
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,281
Isn't that right, kids?

281
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,836
Moving on.

282
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,706
"Discipline."

283
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,359
"How would you handle Marvin

284
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,879
taking another kid's toy?"
Barney?

285
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,681
That's easy.

286
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm calling Child Services.

287
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,404
Wait for it.

288
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:40,141
I'll return your $1,900
alligator-skin belt

289
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:41,893
when you return that toy.

290
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:45,180
Until then, you can wear
this disgusting

291
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:49,384
black-and-brown reversible belt.

292
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,857
Hey, I don't like it
any more than you do!

293
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,994
Ted, how would you discipline
little Marvin?

294
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:01,463
I would be firm.

295
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:04,049
Fair, but firm.

296
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,118
You, sir, just lost
your television privileges.

297
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,790
Okay, you can watch TV,
but nothing violent.

298
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,259
Okay, it can be violent,

299
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,761
but you have
to do the dishes first.

300
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,799
Okay, I'll do the dishes,
you watch TV.

301
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,585
Let's go get some ice cream!
Come on!

302
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:25,170
But no sprinkles.

303
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,172
Robin?

304
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,891
Okay, sprinkles.

305
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,478
Um, I would do what my dad did:
tough love.

306
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,063
You know where
you're headed, chief?

307
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,766
The British Columbia
Military School for Boys.

308
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:41,436
Of course, you're actually a
boy, so at least you won't have

309
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:44,155
to shave off all your hair and
burn your "girlie" clothing in

310
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,124
an old oil drum while
your father stands there

311
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,626
and laughs at you
through the flames!

312
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,846
Oh, my God!

313
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:56,284
I think that Robin wins
this round

314
00:13:56,286 --> 00:14:01,523
because we love her and she's
in a safe space, right, guys?

315
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,474
Robin matters!

316
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,441
Yay! Totally.

317
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,792
Now, that's just
one point, right?

318
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:06,394
Lily.

319
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,963
A spin... that... wheel!

320
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,902
Oh...

321
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:16,738
"Birds and Bees."

322
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,639
Barney, "How would you teach
young Marvin

323
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:20,725
about the facts of life?"

324
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,610
Hmm...

325
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,812
You're gonna love
Amsterdam, little bro.

326
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:33,321
Okay, Barney's out
of this round.

327
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:36,341
Ted, how would you handle
"the talk"?

328
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,327
Well, Marvin would be
a young adult,

329
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,546
so you wouldn't want
to talk down to him.

330
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,217
But that doesn't mean
you can't <i>get</i> down with him.

<i>I'm sorry, don't you need</i>

to actually have had sex
in order to explain it?

338
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,573
Professor Infosaurus also has
a rap about ignoring bullies.

339
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,959
Robin? Birds and bees?

340
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:13,294
Well, I, for one, don't think

341
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,712
you have to teach Marvin
a thing.

342
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:19,250
If he's anything like his dad,
he's a natural-born stud.

343
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,836
Lily got a little braggy

344
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,205
at a cucumber stand once,
big guy.

345
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,307
Robin wins again!

346
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,760
Oh, come on!
That's clearly pandering!

347
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,727
A spin...

348
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,163
that... wheel!

349
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,032
<i>We played long into the night,</i>

350
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,517

I know this hurts,
little buddy,

363
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,379
but you'll love again someday,

364
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,015

a broken heart.

383
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,297
Oh, come on,
if Ted raises him,

384
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:58,650
the poor kid's still gonna
be a virgin when he's 13.

385
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:01,469
I'm the obvious choice.
Hey, look, as the only one of us

386
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:03,771

a natural instinct

387
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,406
for nurturing
and crap like that.

388
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,492
