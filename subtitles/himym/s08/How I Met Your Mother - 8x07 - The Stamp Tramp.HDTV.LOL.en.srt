1
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:03,865
Guys, I'm going through
something kinda hard.

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:06,485
Since Quinn and I broke up,
she's gone back to dancing

3
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:09,704
at The Lusty Leopard,
and it's just really  tough because...

4
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:11,135
'Cause you have to find
a new strip club?

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,758
I have to find a new strip club!

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,626
I've been going to The Lusty Leopard
for seven years.

7
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:18,346
Wow. That's like
49 in perv years.

8
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:20,431
Sixty-nine. Self-five.

9
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,599
Look...

10
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,633
without my open wallet,

11
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:24,335
The Lusty Leopard
would be nothing.

12
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:26,504
Thanks to me, they've
been able to expand

13
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:29,440
and take over that
soup kitchen next door.

14
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:31,342
Now I'm a free agent,

15
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,177
and all the strip
clubs are after me.

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,679
Mr. Stinson, we might not have

17
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,231
the best strippers
at Moneyballs,

18
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,785
but we use sabermetrics to get
you a stripper with a five body,

19
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:44,038
sure, and another with
a butter face, but together,

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,791
with their tireless grinding,
we guarantee

21
00:00:46,793 --> 00:00:49,660
a high on-pants percentage.

22
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,546
I gotta be
honest with you, Fred,

23
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:54,298
I can't really see myself
signing with the Golden Oldies.

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,668
Well, that's what everyone
says... at first.

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,837
But our GILFs have got class.

26
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:01,556
They've got maturity
and experience,

27
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:04,175
and the kind of mind-blowing
flexibility

28
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:07,478
that only comes
from advanced hip dysplasia.

29
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:13,317
Barney, the Lusty Leopard
would be lost without you.

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,603
I think you're really
gonna like a couple of the girls

31
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:17,271
we just pulled up
from the minors.

32
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,973
Don't leave us!

33
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:21,559
Wow, you're like the
LeBron James of strip clubs.

34
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:25,079
Actually, you're probably
tied with LeBron James for that title.

35
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,247
(scoffs) LeBron
isn't all that.

36
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:27,949
The Cavs are doing
great without him.

37
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,700
Yeah!

38
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:33,204
Hey, guys, you will never
believe who I ran into

39
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:34,772
outside of work today.

40
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:36,841
It wasn't the guy
handing out coupons

41
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:38,909
in the hot dog
costume, was it?

42
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,128
Baby, there's no reason
to be scared of him.

43
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm not scared of him.

44
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:46,851
It's totally normal to see
a hot dog with a face.

45
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:49,670
No, it was Brad,
my old law school buddy.

46
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:51,939
I almost didn't recognize him.

47
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:53,307
Marshall?

48
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:55,776
Brad?!

49
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:56,927
Bro!

50
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,429
Oh, hey!

51
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:00,264
What a kick-ass day!

52
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:02,533
I run into you,
some sucker throws away

53
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,368
most of a perfectly good
hot dog...

54
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:06,370
...kick-ass day!

55
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:09,040
You still doing corporate law?

56
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,125
I got downsized two years ago.

57
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,109
It's been rough.

58
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,278
Going through
a little bit of a depresh.

59
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,081
But just today, boom!

60
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,984
Huge job prospect.

61
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:20,801
Here's your application.

62
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:21,969
Just tell them I sent you.

63
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:24,989
I bet you could fit in
the bratwurst.

64
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,141
Bratwurst with a face.

65
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,676
What'd I tell you?

66
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:31,095
Looks like I'm about
to be on a roll.

67
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,264
Sounds like that guy
could use some help.

68
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:34,765
I know!
That's why I said...

69
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,634
You know, I'm at
Honeywell & Cootes,

70
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:38,569
and they're looking
to hire an associate.

71
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:40,404
I could totally recommend you.

72
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:41,556
(all groan)

73
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:43,975
Leave the
wounded behind!

76
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:00,107
'Cause Brad is
an old friend who needs a job.

77
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:01,158
Why shouldn't I give him

78
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,661
the old Marshall Eriksen
Stamp of Approval?

79
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:05,646
Marshall,
you're a stamp tramp.

80
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,481
How dare you!

81
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:09,483
And what is that?!

82
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:12,069
You give your stamp of
approval to everything.

83
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,070
It's become meaningless.

84
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,955
It's like when my
mom likes a movie.

85
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:17,808
It just means Richard
Dreyfuss is in it.

86
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,411
Marshall, you love
everything and everyone.

87
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,246
It's-It's what I love
about you,

88
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:25,783
but it's also why
your stamps are total crap.

89
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:27,117
Give me one example.

90
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,986
How about when
you turned your boss

91
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:31,922
into a fountain
of bodily liquids?

92
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,508
You guys like it?

93
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,261
I'll be waiting for you in hell,
Eriksen.

94
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:38,762
(vomits)

95
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:40,998
(all groaning with disgust)

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,216
In my defense, that restaurant's
health rating had just gone

97
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:44,451
from an "F" to a "D,"
and I wanted to reward that.

98
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,503
Marshall, you're
already on thin ice

99
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,222
with that horrible
Honeywell guy.

100
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:51,008
Don't risk screwing
things up more right before

101
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,192
your biggest case ever.

102
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:53,978
Okay, Honeywell is not horrible,

103
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,729
he just has a bad temper
sometimes.

104
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:57,798
And he holds a grudge.

105
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,434
He's kind of defensive
about his height.

106
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:01,468
And he's cheap.

107
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,887
And he made
those secretaries cry.

108
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:05,589
But, deep down,
he is a great guy.

109
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,024
Heck, he gets my stamp, too.

110
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:08,158
Stamp tramp.

111
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Well, maybe
this isn't the moment

112
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,578
to stick
your neck out for Brad.

113
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,464
Well, that's not how
I was raised.

114
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,250
Back in St. Cloud,
we believe in people,

115
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:20,904
people like Gudren Olsen, the
town wino who became our mayor.

116
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,207
They even wound up naming
a bridge after him.

117
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,776
The one he drove off.

118
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:27,861
Marshall, why can't you be
more like your wife?

119
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:29,013
Lily's stamp is gold.

120
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,547
I'm reading this book
because of her.

121
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:32,816
(bell dings)

122
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,885
I'm drinking this beer
because she recommended it.

123
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:36,437
(bell dings)

124
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,888
I'm even wearing
this bra because

125
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,723
of a lingerie store
Lily told me about.

126
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:41,775
(bell dings twice)

127
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:45,195
Uh, if anyone's got
the golden stamp,

128
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:47,531
it's old Teddy
Westside over here.

129
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:50,751
Please. You're a
piggyback stamper.

130
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:52,419
How dare you!

131
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,038
And what is that?!

132
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,090
Allow us to demonstrate.
Lily?

133
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:59,843
Hey, guys, I just found
a great new sushi restaurant.

134
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:00,794
It's called Katsu...

135
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:02,596
...yoku.
Katsuyoku.

136
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,581
My idea. I'm Ted.

137
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,100
Nailed it.
Totally.

138
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:09,419
Okay, Ted, name one cool
thing you've given

139
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:10,938
your stamp to first...
Dr. Berkowitz.

140
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,440
...that isn't an ear,
nose and throat doctor.

141
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:18,062
Man, these strip clubs
want me so bad.

142
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:21,098
They're sending me T-shirts,
beer cozies.

143
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,767
Sticky's even sent me

144
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,486
a boob-shaped
hand-sanitizer dispenser.

145
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:27,971
It's clean and dirty
at the same time.

146
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:31,542
That's it?
T-shirts and beer cozies?

147
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:32,993
That's disrespect, son!

148
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,128
Here's what you do:

149
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,464
hit a few strip clubs
in Jersey and Long Island.

150
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,616
Jersey? Long Island?

151
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:42,002
Why would I go to
a Third World nation

152
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:43,787
to get my knob wobbled?

153
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:44,755
Well, you wouldn't.

154
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:46,557
But when the clubs in
the city hear

155
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,976
you're sniffing around
across the river,

156
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:50,477
those beer cozies
and T-shirts turn

157
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,130
into Rolexes and fur coats.

158
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,650
Especially from that
strip club, Fur Coats.

159
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:59,486
Wow. That's genius.

160
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:00,971
You're hired.

161
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,089
What do you mean?

162
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,474
I want you to be
my strip club agent.

163
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:06,493
What is wrong with you?

164
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,311
Well, I just figured I'd ask--

165
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:09,496
No, I was talking to myself,

166
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,648
because, for some reason,
I really want to do that!

167
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,083
(laughs)

168
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:15,836
Oh! Oh!
What am I wearing?

169
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:19,206
Just proof of a stamp
I know I gave first,

170
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,175
from a little band called...

171
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:22,760
Dishwalla.

172
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:23,794
Who?

173
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,328
Dishwalla! Come on!

174
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,430
They had that whole,

175
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,398
"Tell Me All Your Thoughts
on God" song.

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,300
ALL:
Oh...

177
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,402
Look, I'm not saying
they're my favorite band,

178
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:33,971
but for a little while
in college,

179
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,974
we were all into that song,
and it was all thanks to me.

180
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,609
But I turned you on
to Dishwalla.

181
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,227
No way! I played them on
my radio show.

182
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,847
I mean, pirate DJ Dr. X
played them on

183
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,315
his beloved radio show.

184
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,201
We all know
you were Dr. X, Ted!

185
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:49,486
And I'm the one
who got us into that song.

186
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:51,371
No! No!
On his beloved radio show,

187
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:54,408
Dr. X pointed out
that the chorus went,

188
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,527
"Tell me all
your thoughts on God"

189
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,863
♪ 'Cause I really want
to meet her. ♪

190
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:02,549
<i>Her.</i> God's a woman.
(mimics explosion)

191
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:03,967
And it blew the minds

192
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:06,136
of everyone listening
to Dr. X that night.

193
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:09,389
Which was pretty much everyone
on campus... including me.

194
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:10,757
I'm not Dr. X.

195
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,426
Oh, so you're saying

196
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:15,896
credit for the stamp goes
to Dr. X then, not you.

197
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,819
(exhales)

198
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,904
Okay... I'm gonna tell you guys
something right now.

199
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:26,190
Take a sip.
Follow my lead.

200
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,992
(exhales)

201
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:30,911
I'm Dr. X.

202
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:34,114
ALL:
No!

203
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:36,233
I hope this
works out, bro.

204
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:38,335
I couldn't even get my leg
in that bratwurst outfit.

205
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:42,289
Don't be nervous.
Honeywell is gonna love you.

206
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,509
Sweet! Freebie
muff-tops!

207
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:49,012
Can I pour you
a pocket of coffee?

208
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:50,881
I didn't say
you were fat.

209
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:53,800
I said that dress makes
you <i>look</i> fat! Idiot!

210
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:55,585
Hey! You must be Brad!

211
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:56,803
I'm excited to meet the man

212
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,355
Eriksen's been talking up
all week.

213
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:01,758
Mr. Honeywell, I have to say,

214
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,393
your environmental
work is amazing.

215
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,695
(bell dings)

216
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:05,863
Come on, it's not like
I'm saving the world.

217
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,565
Oh, wait, yes, I am!

218
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,600
(both laugh)
Great.

219
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:11,785
Marshall tells me you have

220
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:14,604
the big Gruber Pharmaceutical
trial coming up.

221
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:15,822
I'd love to give you my
thoughts on the case,

222
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:18,325
but I can't take full credit.

223
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:19,960
Most of these are
from my psychic.

224
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:21,545
My psychic always

225
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:23,046
pushes for a settlement.

226
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:25,415
But my numerologist says
roll the dice with the jury.

227
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,417
I'm waiting for my
astrologist to weigh in,

228
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,253
but he can be
kind of flaky.

229
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,338
You know, Cancer.

230
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,623
Should know more after
he's back from chemo.

231
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,426
(bell dings)
Good luck, bro!

232
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:44,343
You know the best part about you
challenging me on Dishwalla?

233
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,243
Didn't challenge you, don't care.
It made me

234
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:48,696
dig up my old video diaries
from freshman year.

235
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,781
And somewhere in here
there's gonna be proof

236
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:52,266
that I am not a
piggyback stamper.

237
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,368
I have my own
original ideas.

238
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,437
Didn't you only do
the video diaries

239
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,072
because of Winona Ryder
in <i>Reality Bites?</i>

240
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,473
No.

241
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,125
I don't know what
you're talk-- shut up.

242
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:03,477
Let's just watch.

243
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,546
How do you even know there's
gonna be mention

244
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:06,964
of Dishwalla on those tapes?
I don't.

245
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:09,600
And it may take me days
to go through them all,

246
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:12,519
but that is how committed
I am to the truth.

247
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:16,140
LILY: Hey, you guys should check out
that song by the band Dishwalla.

248
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:18,325
TED: Really?
I've never heard of them.

249
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:20,594
Damn it!

250
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:21,712
So?

251
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:23,113
Bottom line, Vito:
a lot of

252
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:24,648
strip clubs are into my client.

253
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,533
If you want the Melon Patch
to be in the mix,

254
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:28,869
we're gonna need bigger melons
and smaller patches.

255
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:30,537
Otherwise, your establishment
is not where

256
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,539
Barney Stinson
is gonna pitch his tent.

257
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,808
(chuckles)
B-Dawg, Barn Door,

258
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,327
Stinson-natti, Bro-hio!

259
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,712
Talk to me.
How's it hangin'?

260
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:40,664
You are killing it
at this agent thing!

261
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,500
I just got a big box
at Yankee Stadium

262
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,336
from the ladies at The Big Box.

263
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:46,420
Mm-hmm.

264
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,088
One question: Golden Oldies

265
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,791
just sent me a fax machine
and a Charo calendar.

266
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:52,626
Mm-hmm.
Aren't they out of the running?

267
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:54,978
Yeah, but those old bitches
don't need to know that.

268
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,930
Yeah, I just feel kind of bad.

269
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,766
They just spent eight grand

270
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,467
on that wheelchair ramp
up to the stage.

271
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,153
Hey, Larry, how's everything
at the Beaver Dam?

272
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,988
I don't even know
that strip club.

273
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,357
Oh, it's not a club.

274
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,992
My cousin Larry is
a forest ranger in Squamish.

275
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:10,994
Oh, yeah?

276
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:12,312
Then I was fired from

277
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:13,781
Bed Bath & Beyond

278
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:15,165
for telling
inappropriate jokes.

279
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,116
I mean...

280
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,168
get a sense of
humor, LaShonda.

281
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,787
You know how "they" are.

282
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,790
"They" meaning Bed Bath
& Beyond employees, right?

283
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,824
Hmm?

284
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:25,292
No. Women.

285
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,261
That still could have
been worse.

286
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:29,930
Thank God I ran
into Marshall.

287
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,832
This guy's supportive
as balls.

288
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,133
And here I am.

289
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,219
Yes, we both owe Marshall
a debt of gratitude

290
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:37,638
for getting you
this interview.

291
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,605
Eriksen...

292
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:40,674
can I see you outside?
Sure.

293
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:43,444
Good. Try to stay
out there a few minutes.

294
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:47,364
I just cut one, and I can
tell it's gonna be a slow burn.

295
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,233
(clears throat)

296
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:52,619
TED:
What <i>is</i> Generation X?

297
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,355
What does the X in
"Generation X" stand for?

298
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:56,907
What do <i>we</i> stand for?

299
00:10:56,909 --> 00:10:59,877
Why aren't people on campus
talking about this?

300
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,162
Maybe you should do
a radio show

301
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:05,031
and call yourself Dr. X.

302
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:06,250
(laughing)

303
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,886
I just had an amazing idea.

304
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:11,705
(groans)

305
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:13,140
Just turn it off!

306
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:14,808
I can't look away.

307
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,844
Oh, God, no.

308
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,896
Oh, God, I'm putting on a beret.

309
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,197
You were there.

310
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,899
Why didn't you tell me
that looked stupid?

311
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,768
LILY:
Ted, that beret looks stupid.

312
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,438
TED (French accent):
I agree to disagree.

313
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,940
Marshall, that man is the human
equivalent of what came out

314
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,909
of my body after eating
that soup you recommended!

315
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:33,110
This guy's your friend?

316
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:36,163
Really more of an
acquaintance than a friend.

317
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,532
(bell dings)
No backpedaling.

318
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,033
You're Marshall Eriksen.

319
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,453
You believe in people.

320
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,421
You know what Brad
hasn't told you?

321
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,507
He was third in our
class at Columbia.

322
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,342
That is impressive.

323
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,761
And I suppose he did warn us
about the fart.

324
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:51,845
He's a great guy.

325
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:55,048
Please... give him
just one more chance.

326
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,801
Two more minutes.

327
00:11:57,803 --> 00:11:59,419
(bell dings)

328
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:00,888
I'm proud of you.

329
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,924
I'm proud of you for
being proud of me.

330
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:06,593
(light ding)

331
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:10,597
You went undergrad
to Holy Cross?

332
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,615
That's my alma mater.

333
00:12:11,617 --> 00:12:13,450
I went there on a basketball
scholarship.

334
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,202
No way. I played center.

335
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,070
(scoffs)
Uh-oh.

336
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:18,539
Why is that so shocking?

337
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,108
'Cause you're, like,
an itty-bitty fella.

338
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:23,827
Hey, uh, fish, huh?

339
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:24,795
Fish are crazy, right?

340
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:25,963
You guys ever think
about fish?

341
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:28,298
I am six-foot one, sir.

342
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,751
Bro, I'm at least
a foot taller than you.

343
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:34,254
Well, then I guess that makes
you a freakish seven-foot one.

344
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,006
What do you call fish
with no eyes?

345
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,091
"Fsh."

346
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:41,512
I am six-feet and one inch,
and I'll prove it.

347
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,146
(snaps fingers)
Eriksen.

348
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,319
How tall are you?

349
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:52,072
Seven feet.

350
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:55,359
So, we've got
a deal somewhere?

351
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:56,643
We sure do.

352
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,195
You are the new face of--

353
00:12:58,197 --> 00:13:01,982
and exclusive customer to...

354
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:04,284
Golden Oldies!

355
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:05,836
What?!

356
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:07,621
I thought we ruled them out!

357
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:09,957
(high-pitched):
I don't remember that!

358
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,758
Now let's go. It is 4:00,

359
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,794
and their dinner show starts
in ten minutes.

360
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:15,679
Wait a minute.

361
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,130
Oh...

362
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,164
Is that a Rolex?

363
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,600
Huh. What do you know?

364
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:20,801
How did that get there?

365
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:24,671
Anyway, uh, so
initial here and...

366
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,974
Where'd you get
the bling, Robin?

367
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,642
Uh...

368
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:30,527
They bribed you.

369
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,779
They bribed you!

370
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:35,449
Why else would you pick a place
where the strippers say

371
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,684
they're trying to put their
grandkids through college?!

372
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,352
Please leave!

373
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:40,988
Barney, I can explain, okay?

374
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,522
Please...

375
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:45,876
leave.

376
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:48,028
Say it, you giant beast!
Say I'm six-one!

377
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,547
Maybe if you stood on top
of that pot of gold

378
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,516
you have at the end
of your rainbow.

379
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:53,967
You know something?!

380
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,469
You're nothing but a...

381
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:56,887
a tree man!

382
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,840
I never want to
see you again, tree man!

383
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:00,974
Fine.

384
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:02,743
I have to go to the
little boys' room.

385
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:04,210
Not your office.

386
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:06,546
I need to take a dump.

387
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:10,183
If that's the type of guy
you vouch for,

388
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:11,518
I can't trust your judgment.

389
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,236
You're off the Gruber
Pharmaceutical case.

390
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,655
No...

391
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:22,234
Oh, good, we're up to the
time I got my ear pierced.

392
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,452
(on video):
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

393
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:25,069
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't, don't.

394
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:27,427
Okay, do it now.
Do, do, do it, do it.

395
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:30,335
Don't, don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't do it!

396
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:34,053
Don't! Yes, you can do this.
You can...

397
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,222
That goes on for 45 minutes.

398
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,976
Hey... how was work, baby?

399
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:43,779
Remember how
I always wanted to know

400
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:46,065
what it was like to be a ghost?

401
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:48,818
Well, I don't want that anymore.

402
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,185
Okay, suppose we lead

403
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:52,822
with the carbon testing
of the residue water.

404
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:55,991
How do we keep
the jury engaged? Anyone?

405
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,578
You could bring up
the survey from

406
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,047
Dr. Pasquesi's testimony.

407
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,165
Anyone?

408
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,669
Anyone who isn't dead to me?

409
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:09,255
Then you have to earn
Honeywell's trust back.

410
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:10,723
Just start small.

411
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,174
Put your stamp on little things

412
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:13,976
that have nothing
to do with work.

413
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,060
Like a funny video.

414
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:18,230
I, uh, I may have something.

415
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:23,051
TED: Don't think, Mosby! Do it now!
Oh, my God, I'm doing it!

416
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:24,720
Wow, he's a real bleeder!

417
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,405
(bell dings)

418
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:29,391
LILY: <i>And then you build to something</i>
<i>else small, like a tasty snack.</i>

419
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,393
Don't sleep on the popcorn.

420
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:34,530
Try mixing the caramel
and the cheese.

421
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:35,998
It shouldn't work,

422
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,666
but... it... does.

423
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:40,419
There's no way caramel
and cheese... That's good!

424
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,304
That is good. Oh!

425
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:43,706
(bell dings)

426
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,875
LILY: <i>And when Honeywell starts</i>
<i>trusting your stamp again,</i>

427
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,177
<i>he'll seek out</i>
<i>your opinion on things.</i>

428
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:49,261
Be honest, Eriksen.

429
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:51,046
Is this deep-V working?

430
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:53,265
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>you lie your ass off.</i>

431
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:54,850
Sir...

432
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:57,019
I think you could
go even deeper.

433
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,104
(bell dings)

434
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:01,390
<i>And before you know it...</i>

435
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:02,591
Eriksen, get in here.

436
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:05,561
<i>...you're back on the case.</i>

437
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,533
Ted, why are you
torturing yourself?

438
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:12,618
None of us were
our best in college.

439
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,971
Oh, my God, I love
my hair there!

440
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:19,992
I always thought I was this kid
from suburban Ohio

441
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:22,828
who had this innate sense
of judgment and taste

442
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,382
and just showed up to college
and wowed everyone.

443
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,418
Now I have concrete proof
that I wasn't.

444
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,637
I was a total gomer.

445
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,806
Maybe I still am.

446
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,558
Wait-- that's
the giant suit

447
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,460
Marshall wore on
our third date.

448
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:39,678
TED (on video):
So...

449
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,096
Marshall Eriksen,

450
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:44,733
you just came back from
your third date with Lily.

451
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:45,768
How was it?

452
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,186
Great, yeah.

453
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:52,491
I just... I think I'm falling
for this girl pretty hard.

454
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:54,410
But is everything
happening too fast?

455
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:56,495
I mean, maybe I should
see other people.

456
00:16:56,497 --> 00:16:57,913
Whoa, dude, no!

457
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:01,149
Lily Aldrin is special.
You hold on to that girl.

458
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,768
MARSHALL:
She is.

459
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,869
I'm only 18 and...

460
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:06,205
Marshall, you being 18
isn't a bad thing.

461
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:09,658
It just means you get to spend
even more of your life with her.

462
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,044
I mean, I'm probably
not gonna meet my wife

463
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,380
until I'm, like, 23.

464
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,099
You're right.

465
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:20,502
What am I thinking?

466
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,505
I'm in love
with this girl.

467
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,674
Ted, oh, my God.

468
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:28,844
You gave me
the ultimate stamp.

469
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:33,449
And in my whole life,
this life...

470
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:36,735
it all goes back to that moment.

471
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:41,824
TED (on video): I mean, maybe take
a month off, bang a couple chicks.

472
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:43,692
Lily's not going anywhere.

473
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,181
Hey, Barney.
Hey.

474
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:51,800
Um, look, I'm sorry about the
whole skimming-off-the-top-

475
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,003
of-the-strip-club-swag thing.

476
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,888
Hey, it happens to everybody.

477
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,673
Really? Because even
as I said those words,

478
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,709
they did not feel
like a real thing.

479
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:03,729
Hey, look, wherever you end up,
can I have the dubious honor

480
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:05,431
of buying you
your first lap dance?

481
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,215
It's a date.

482
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:12,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for "The Decision."

483
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,889
(boombox plays fanfare)

484
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,157
Yeah.

485
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,328
Ladies, my bro-dium?

486
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,996
Yeah. (chuckles)

487
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:22,197
Look at this!

488
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:25,334
Man, this whole
free agent experience,

489
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:28,320
it's been an unbelievable
experience,

490
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:31,239
a real humbling experience.

491
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:34,259
First of all, The Lusty Leopard
is where I developed my game.

492
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:35,844
Oh...

493
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:40,015
(voice breaks): I have nothing
but the utmost respect for you skanks.

494
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,750
He's just gonna stay
at The Lusty Leopard.

495
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:43,251
They have loyalty
and heart.

496
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,586
I bet you
he rewards that.

497
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:47,222
LeBron moved on, Ted.
So should you.

498
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:51,193
But Barney Stinson has
to do what's right

499
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,278
for Barney Stinson's penis.

500
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,083
In this fall... This is tough.

501
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,736
Um... in this fall I'm going

502
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,772
to take my talents
to Mouth Beach.

503
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,131
NARRATOR: <i>The next day, Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>went to court</i>

504
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,916
<i>for the biggest case</i>
<i>of his life.</i>

505
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,585
Hey, Marshall!
Bilbo!

506
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:18,470
Brad? What are you...?

507
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:20,989
Did you just get hired

508
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,658
by Gruber Pharmaceutical's
legal team?

509
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,626
Oh, not just.

510
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,428
I've been working
for them for two years.

511
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,631
<i>I heard about the job opening</i>
<i>at Honeywell & Cootes</i>

512
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:32,818
<i>and knew that if I hung out</i>
<i>in front of your office</i>

513
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,021
<i>and pretended to be down on</i>
<i>my luck, you'd take pity on me,</i>

514
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:37,139
<i>get me an interview...</i>

515
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,774
Try to stay out there
a few minutes.

516
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:42,861
I just cut one, and I can tell
it's gonna be a slow burn.

517
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:45,998
<i>...and buy some alone time</i>
<i>in the conference room.</i>

518
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:55,040
I got your firm's strategy
for the case.

519
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,042
Muchas gracias, bro-migo.

520
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:01,680
He's really more of an
acquaintance than a bro-migo.

521
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,682
Win this case
or you're fired, Eriksen.

522
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:06,635
NARRATOR: <i>And so began the trial that</i>
<i>would change the course</i>

523
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:07,703

00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:10,806
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

525
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:15,010
Oh, you see?! This is what
I miss about being single:

526
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:17,012
cutting loose
at a strip club,

527
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,565
drinkin' some beers,
seein' some boobs,

528
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,367
getting thrown out
for being "too handsy."

529
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,037
You were a little
out of control tonight.

530
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,205
You know,
I really thought

531
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:29,708
that that bouncer was
bluffing with the Taser.

532
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,711
Man, everything's gonna taste
like pennies for a week.

533
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:34,580
I had a fun time
tonight, though.

534
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:36,131
Me, too.

535
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,499
I always have fun with you.

536
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,717
(chuckles)

537
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:48,043
Whoa, whoa.

538
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:51,847
I-I've got to... um...

539
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:54,233
We can't, we can't
do this.

540
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:55,517
(stammers)

541
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,569
This, this can't happen.

542
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:02,122
Uh, I've got to go.
What...?
