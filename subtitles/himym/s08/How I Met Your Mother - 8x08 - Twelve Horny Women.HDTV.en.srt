00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:04,544
<i>Kids, this a story about</i>
<i>the time your Uncle Marshall</i>

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:07,530
<i>went before the New York State</i>
<i>Judiciary Committee,</i>

3
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:10,666
<i>a panel that would decide</i>
<i>the fate of his career.</i>

4
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:12,801
<i>He thought he'd open</i>
<i>with an icebreaker.</i>

5
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:17,106
By the way, did I mention
those robes really do you all...

6
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:18,724
justice?

7
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:23,111
I'm just saying
that you're all guilty...

8
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:25,080
of looking sharp.

9
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:26,148
Mr. Eriksen, please.

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,249
You're here to discuss

11
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:29,117
your conduct in court

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,388
during the week
of November 19, 2012.

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,455
Of course, Your Honor.

14
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:34,490
It all

15
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,624
started when...

16
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:38,060
<i>a so-called friend</i>
<i>from law school</i>

17
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:39,094
<i>conned me into believing</i>

18
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:40,679
<i>that he needed my help</i>
<i>getting a job,</i>

19
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:43,315
<i>when in reality,</i>
<i>he stole my firm's strategy</i>

20
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:45,100
<i>for our upcoming trial against</i>

21
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:48,136
<i>Gruber Pharmaceuticals, who'd</i>
<i>been polluting a lake upstate.</i>

22
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,873
<i>Turns out,</i>
<i>he was representing Gruber.</i>

23
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,325
Win this case
or you're fired, Eriksen.

24
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:55,344
How could you trick me
like that?

25
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,145
This is the biggest trial
in my career.

26
00:00:57,147 --> 00:00:58,330
Mine too, brobeans.

27
00:00:58,332 --> 00:00:59,832
When I win this trial,

28
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,367
I'm gonna buy a new car.

29
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,484
Thinking Lambo.

30
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,152
Awesome. I mean, no!

31
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:05,621
What happened to you?

32
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,673
You used to be, like,
the nicest guy ever.

33
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,124
We were bros.

34
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,626
More than bros.

35
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:12,428
We ate brunch together.

36
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,713
And I'll always cherish that.

37
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:15,798
But after Kara

38
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,882
broke my heart again

39
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:17,967
for the millionth time,

40
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:19,351
I said screw being nice,

41
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:22,137
suited up and started lying
to get what I want.

42
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:23,355
That does happen.

43
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:25,441
But you used to want to fight
for the little guy.

44
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:27,676
Little guys pay
with little checks.

45
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:29,628
But... you already know that.

46
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,613
You're in
environmental law.

47
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:33,399
Marshall, you have a kid.

48
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:34,450
How are you
gonna provide

49
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,318
for the little dude's futche?

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,238
I'm worried
about Planet Earth's futche!

51
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,955
That's why
I'm gonna

52
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:41,323
kick your ass in this trial.

53
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:43,993
Sure, you may have swiped our
entire strategy for this case,

54
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:45,961
but I still got
some tricks up my sleeve

55
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:48,213
that you know
absolutely nothing about.

56
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:48,831
Really?

57
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:49,665
No.

Hey!

Hey!

66
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:14,023
How are you?

67
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:14,940
Great. You?

68
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:15,991
Good, so good.

69
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:17,726
Oh, great. Good to see you!
You, too!

70
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,428
<i>They pretended</i>
<i>it never happened.</i>

71
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,596
All right, guys,

72
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,247
this is the biggest case
of Marshall's career.

73
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,365
That is why it's so great

74
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,084
that we all called in sick
to work tomorrow,

75
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,902
so we could be in that
courtroom to support him.

76
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:27,870
I didn't call in sick.

77
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:29,088
I called in
for all of us.

78
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,255
Uh, I have strep throat.

79
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,290
Robin, bronchitis.

80
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,708
Barney, massive
hemorrhoids.

81
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,710
Why'd you have
to say "massive"?

82
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,211
Well, if you're gonna
miss work for hemorrhoids,

83
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:37,913
they kind of have
to be massive.

84
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:40,248
I don't want to sit
in a courtroom all day.

85
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,601
I bet you don't want to sit
anywhere with those hemorrhoids.

86
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:44,937
I don't have... Shut up.

87
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,522
Look, you guys
wouldn't understand,

88
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:49,441
but when you have a rap sheet
as long as mine,

89
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:50,776
the last place
you want to spend

90
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:51,760
a day is in court.

91
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,362
Rap sheet?

92
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:54,697
That's right.

93
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,665
When I was a teenager, Lily,

94
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,701
I was a total badass.
Pfft.

95
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:01,269
You want to talk
about teenage badasses?

96
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,390
I was like John Gotti
in a training bra.

97
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,875
I'm serious.

98
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:09,144
In high school, before
I started dating Scooter,

99
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,063
even he was afraid of me.

100
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:21,256
Lily coming!

101
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,425
Lily coming!

102
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:29,098
You look okay.

103
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,400
Want to hang out?

104
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:33,786
Uh, my mom says I'm only allowed
three friends, so...

105
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:36,688
Your mom don't make the rules
no more, Scooter.

106
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,107
My name's Jeff.

107
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,475
Not no more it ain't.

108
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:44,079
The one part of
that story I believe

109
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,781
is that Scooter only
had three friends.

110
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:46,782
Ah!

111
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:47,983
Here he is.

112
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:49,218
The pride of St. Cloud,

113
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,419
the environmental lawyer

114
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,620
we've come
to know and love.

115
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:52,921
He's mean. He's green.

116
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,506
He's not wearing the tie
I bought him for the trial,

117
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:55,841
but I'm not gonna
mention it...

118
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:59,128
Marshall "I Was Gonna
Say 'Nice Tie'" Eriksen!

119
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:01,329
How you feeling,

120
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,664
Counselor?

121
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,882
Well, uh, I mean,
at first

122
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,300
that Brad thing
had me rattled,

123
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:06,969
but now I feel
pretty good.

124
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,303
I mean, for one thing,

125
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:10,172
I don't have massive
hemorrhoids. Sorry, buddy.

126
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,023
I don't have ma...

127
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,474
And more importantly,
unlike Brad,

128
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:15,010
I actually have something
to fight for.

129
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,146
Pop, because of
your precedent-setting

130
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:18,847
legal victory 14 years ago,

131
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:20,699
kids like me can fish
in clean lakes

132
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:22,868
all over the world.

133
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,903
They sure can, champ.

134
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:27,956
Because when you
do one good deed...

135
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:32,961
...it creates
a ripple effect.

136
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:35,164
One good deed

137
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,916
leads to another and another.

138
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,869
Man, you're wise.

139
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,205
That's probably why I never
have felt the need to do drugs

140
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:44,556
or rebel in any way.

141
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:50,212
Anyhoo...

142
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:53,065
<i>The next day, we all headed</i>
<i>down to court</i>

143
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,850
<i>to support Uncle Marshall.</i>

144
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,251
Yeah.

145
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:58,487
Want to know what
I looked like at age 15?

146
00:04:58,489 --> 00:04:59,771
There it is.

147
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:01,607
I don't get it.
That guy wasn't masturbating.

148
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,659
Yeah, and the waistband
of his undies wasn't pulled up

149
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:06,161
to his Cub Scouts neckerchief.

150
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:08,363
Ted,

151
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,199
you were never a badass.

152
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,233
<i>Au contraire.</i>

153
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:12,618
Off to a good start...

154
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,619
I was locked up

155
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:15,403
plenty of times
as a teenager.

156
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,421
Let's just say

157
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:18,373
Johnny Law was not a fan

158
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,292
of Teddy Westside.

159
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:22,261
Make sure you get
my good side...

160
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,463
Princess.

161
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,583
You guys want to talk

162
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:30,702
about hassling
the fuzz?

163
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:32,888
Finish that, Scoots.

164
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,090
Okay,

165
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:36,725
let's see some IDs.

166
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,111
Scooter, do you
smell bacon?

167
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:42,281
Laugh, bitch.

168
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:43,532
Ha!

169
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:44,599
Ha ha!

170
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,435
ID now, both of you.

171
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:50,405
Which one of you

172
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,790
is Yuki Hakutani?

173
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,608
Right here.

174
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,246
So, Yuki, you're 6'1"
and you were born in 1947?

175
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:00,115
Congratulations.
You can read.

176
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,505
Barney Stinson?

177
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:09,558
Well, if it isn't
Warren Frankel.

178
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,726
<i>Bailiff</i>

179
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:11,977
Warren Frankel,

180
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:14,429
- who knows me.
- You know,

181
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:16,398
I almost didn't recognize you
without handcuffs on.

182
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,517
Yeah, I've matured quite
a bit since the old days.

183
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,468
The only time I'm wearing
handcuffs now is, uh,

184
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,570
in the bedroom.

185
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,471
Bondage. I get it.

186
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:24,656
Well,

187
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:25,941
I have to run.

188
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,192
Stay out of trouble.

189
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:32,147
Badass.

190
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,685
In summary, I will prove
that Gruber Pharmaceuticals

191
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,788
wantonly and knowingly
polluted Frog Lake

192
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,674
and therefore must pay
restitution of no less

193
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:45,344
than $25 million.

194
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:47,329
Thank you.

195
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:51,183
How's this for a fact:

196
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:52,968
Frog Lake is home

197
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,304
to a buttload of frogs
and birds.

198
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,672
If it's so polluted,

199
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,058
why don't all those birds fly
to a cleaner lake?

200
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,561
And why don't the frogs
just be like,

201
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:05,314
"Hey, birds, can I catch
a ride, ribbit?"

202
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:08,317
Marshall's gonna wipe
the floor with this ding-dong.

203
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:10,518
Oops.

204
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,187
I seem to have dropped my pen.

205
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:23,865
Objection, Your Honor.

206
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,084
Nobody needs this long
to pick up a pen.

207
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:29,371
I'll allow it.

208
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:36,585
The biggest case of my life
and I'd already lost the jury.

209
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:37,905
I mean,

210
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,858
I've heard of <i>Twelve Angry Men,</i>

211
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,028
but this was more
like <i>Twelve Horny Women.</i>

212
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,363
Stay on topic.

213
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:48,116
I can't compete
with Brad.

214
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:49,817
The jury is
in love with him.

215
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,537
During recess, one of those
ladies raced across the hall

216
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,738
to see if she could
get a divorce.

217
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,707
And I'm pretty sure
there was some funny business

218
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,577
going on under
that judge's robe.

219
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,329
What you guys saw
Brad do was nothing.

220
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,681
He's taken it to a
whole other level.

221
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,183
Ladies and...

222
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,052
ladies of the jury,

223
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,753
I'm sorry if I seem down.

224
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,771
My girlfriend

225
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,256
Kara...

226
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,192
broke up with me last night.

227
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,776
Aww...

228
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,928
She said I listen too much,

229
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,981
whatever that means.

230
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:21,649
Aww...
Aww...

231
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:25,570
Can you believe this guy?

232
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,991
Really?

233
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,426
Do I even want to see
what I look like?

234
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:38,049
Wow.

235
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,117
That's, like, super mean.

236
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:44,788
Next, Brad brought out
his "expert witness."

237
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,725
So, Dr. Bedrosian,
you're saying

238
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,028
that even if Gruber
Pharmaceuticals'

239
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,016
industry-leading drugs
somehow seeped into Frog Lake,

240
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:58,152
they could actually be
helping the otter population

241
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,521
grow <i>thicker</i> coats of fur?

242
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,241
Absolutely.

243
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,193
And for the older
birds, who...

244
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:08,613
maybe don't perform as well
in the bedroom as they used to,

245
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,498
could actually
be having

246
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,149
healthier sex lives?

247
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,368
In my expert opinion...

248
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,536
yes...?

249
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,821
Yes.

250
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,707
So Gruber...

251
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:22,026
is giving these animals
free medicine.

252
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,731
Medicine that you or I would
have to pay a fortune for if...

253
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,883
we needed help
in the bedroom...

254
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,218
which I don't.

255
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,339
You're so bad.

256
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,557
But I realized,

257
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,144
if Brad could call a quack
as his star witness,

258
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,647
then so could I.

259
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,650
You'll get that in a second.

260
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,151
Meet Paddles,

261
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,619
the duckling.

262
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,203
"Quack."

263
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,238
Continue.

264
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,690
Little Paddles here just spent

265
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,858
three months being nursed
back to health.

266
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,494
Why?

267
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,496
Well, because he was found
in Frog Lake

268
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,865
suffering
from acute dermatitis...

269
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,637
...a painful full-body rash,
caused by who?

270
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,839
Gruber Pharmaceuticals.

271
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,892
For a brief, shining moment,

272
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:14,562
it looked like I might
just win this thing.

273
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:15,980
But then...

274
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:20,084
I took a field trip to this
so-called "polluted" lake.

275
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,485
If you'll indulge me,

276
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,238
I'd like to share my experience.

277
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,109
Frog Lake.

278
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,561
Behold...

279
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,613
nature's beauty.

Those jive-ass turkeys

Well, they're
pretty swamped

299
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,813
arresting 1970s pimps
like yourself.

300
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:40,848
Lily, let it go.

301
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,267
I didn't want to brag,
but I think

302
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,468
it's time to acknowledge

303
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,439
that <i>I</i> was the ultimate
teenage badass of this group.

304
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,609
You were a teen
pop star in Canada.

305
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,245
You sang songs about the mall.
Hey.

306
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,164
There is a dark side
to being a rocker on the road

307
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,582
north of the 49th.

308
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,319
Mm, thanks.

309
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:05,745
Hey.

310
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,959
We've received
some noise complaints, eh?

311
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,094
Can you please lower the music?

312
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,596
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

313
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,831
Sure.

314
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,333
How aboot, uh,
I lower the TV, too,

315
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,635
yeah?

316
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,510
Three hours later,
I was arrested

317
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,864
drunk, naked,
and driving a Zamboni.

318
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:33,284
Man, that DUI drove my insurance
through the roof.

319
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,704
Please be seated.

320
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,490
Mr. Morris,
good seeing you this morning.

321
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,242
Mr. Eriksen...

322
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,042
you're here.

323
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:43,544
Any, uh,

324
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:44,745
final witnesses?

325
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,164
Well, Your Honor, um...

326
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,384
Um...

327
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,039
Actually, Your Honor,
uh, I'm afraid...

328
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,843
Mr. Eriksen?

329
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,898
Your Honor,
I call Brad Morris

330
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,015
to the stand.

331
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,600
Mr. Eriksen, this is

332
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,051
highly irregular.
I would like

333
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,820
Mr. Morris to remove his shirt.

334
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,406
I'll allow it.
Objection, Your Honor,

335
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,057
on grounds that this is ridonk!

336
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,860
Overruled. Take it off.

337
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,008
Acute...

338
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,010
dermatitis,

339
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,763
courtesy of Frog Lake

340
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,715
and Gruber
Pharmaceuticals.

341
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:42,019
That was badass.

342
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,537
So, in the end,

343
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,891
one might say you were forced
to do something...

344
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,275
rash?

345
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:51,228
Rash!

346
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,114
You know, I had that one,
but Lily told me to cut it.

347
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:55,616
Um, anyway...

348
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:58,101
all that was left
was the verdict.

349
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:04,041
"We, the jury,
find Gruber Pharmaceuticals...

350
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,376
guilty."

351
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,411
Yes!

352
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,131
$25 million.

353
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:14,752
That tie is not only
tasteful; it's lucky!

354
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:19,122
I hereby fine Gruber
in the amount of $25,000.

355
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,925
Court is adjourned.

356
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,241
Your Honor, $25,000?
What just happened?

357
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,844
Son, yes, Gruber Pharmaceuticals
probably polluted that lake,

358
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:36,679
but I'm not gonna ruin
an important company

359
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:38,531
just because they gave
some bird a rash.

360
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,899
No, but it's thousands of birds,

361
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:42,085
and fish and otters and turtles...
Look, Eriksen,

362
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:43,503
I hate to cut you short,

363
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,421
but I got tickets to <i>Annie</i>
and my wife is waiting.

364
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:47,040
You have a wi...

365
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:49,292
won-wonderful show to see?

366
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:50,877
Guilty. Ciao.

367
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,766
You'd best get
your mind right, son!

368
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:59,102
The game is the game,
and there ain't no winners.

369
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:01,771
How many retired
gangbangers you know?

370
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:03,756
Exactly.

371
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:09,696
Barney...

372
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:11,297
check it out.

373
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:12,815
I found my scrapbook
from the old days.

374
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,367
We're kind of busy
right now, Warren.

375
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:15,485
We're scaring kids
straight, so...

376
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:16,736
No, no.
Barney was

377
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:18,905
the youngest member
of our Magic Enthusiasts Club

378
00:15:18,907 --> 00:15:19,956
years back.

379
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,107
Famous for

380
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,408
escaping from handcuffs.

381
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,292
Handcuffs, huh?

382
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,627
Very tiny hands.

383
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,829
That was his secret.

384
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,499
See you around, baby hands.

385
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:33,972
So, you don't know the bailiff
because you were a badass.

386
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,225
You knew him because you guys
were in a nerd club together.

387
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,146
Where you dazzled audiences
with your sleight-of-tiny-hand.

388
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,282
So I was a late hand bloomer!

389
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:46,151
Go ahead, laugh,

390
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,636
laugh like all the others,

391
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:50,622
but those magicians pulled off
the greatest trick of all:

392
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:53,658
they accepted me.

393
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:57,195
Okay, well,
to be fair,

394
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:59,831
I... may have
slightly exaggerated

395
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,083
my badass story, too.

396
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:05,587
Oh, sorry. Uh, no,
thank you, housekeeping.

397
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,239
I've already made my bed.

398
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:10,342
And I only used
one washcloth, so it's...

399
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,395
Congratulations,
Miss Sparkles.

400
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:14,579
On behalf

401
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:15,981
of the Manitoba Hotel

402
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:18,350
and Curling Rink Association,
we'd like to thank you

403
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,103
for being the nicest, most
well-behaved hotel guest ever.

404
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:24,222
Oh, yippee!

405
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,024
What a loser!

406
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,059
Your story's not true,
either, is it, Ted?

407
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,361
Not at all.

408
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,731
Make sure you get
my good side, Princess!

409
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,869
I left the courthouse that day

410
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,789
questioning what
I was even doing with my life...

411
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,675
and then that night,
I had a dream.

412
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:45,744
Sorry I failed, son.

413
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,629
What about your
Pebble Theory, Dad?

414
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,132
One good deed ripples out
and makes another and another?

415
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,018
Yeah.

416
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,919
This is what really happens

417
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:59,024
when you throw a pebble
into Frog Lake.

418
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,562
The truth is,
you can fight

419
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:07,932
your whole life to do good
and still get nowhere.

420
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,100
You're wrong.

421
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:11,453
Some good's gonna ripple
out of this, Dad.

422
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:13,204
I promise.

423
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,794
Great, I've angered
the Frog King.

424
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:23,614
Later that night,
some good did ripple out.

425
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,918
Hey.

426
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,070
What, are you
here to gloat?

427
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:32,474
No. Came here to thank you.

428
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:33,508
For reminding me

429
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,810
of why I got into law
in the first place:

430
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:37,479
to fight for the little guy.

431
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:38,513
Which is why

432
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,298
I said <i>"Hasta Lucia"</i> to my firm,

433
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,467
and took a job
at your firm, brobeans.

434
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,135
Don't "brobeans" me.

435
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:47,939
My boss would never hire you
after the way you lied to us.

436
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,492
I told him I'd take every
last bit of manipulation,

437
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:52,410
deception, and accidental
pen-dropping

438
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:56,197
I used against you guys and
put it towards saving the world.

439
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,499
Even if that's true,

440
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,251
I'm still not sure
that I can forgive you.

441
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:04,122
Would you object to
an 11:15 brunch rezzy for two

442
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,591
tomorrow at the Popover Pantry?

443
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,845
I'll allow it.

444
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,514
Yes! The Brunch Bros are back!

445
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:16,851
And thank God we were,
because...

446
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:18,436
well, what he said next

447
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:21,139
is the reason that
I'm sitting in this chair.

448
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,440
Seriously,

449
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:25,676
thanks-- for giving my soul
a little redempsh.

450
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:28,613
And B-T-dubs,
that judge was an idiot.

451
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:29,864
It's people
like you,

452
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:33,701
people with hope
and vision and integ,

453
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:36,687
that should be behind that bench
making the calls.

454
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,959
And that's when I realized
I wanted to be a judge.

455
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:42,193
Because judges

456
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:44,379
are the ones who
can effect real change.

457
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:45,696
And that's why I'm here,

458
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,967
before the New York State
Judiciary Committee.

459
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,719
I hope that you will consider me

460
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:55,056
for an appointment
to a judgeship.

461
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:56,274
Thank you,
Mr. Eriksen.

462
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,643
The panel will take this
under advisement.

463
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:01,262
Take your time.

464
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:04,766
It could be a few months.

465
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:09,020
Better tell my wife
I won't be home for dinner.

466
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,054
Get out.

467
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:15,893
Hey.

468
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:16,894
Hey.

469
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:18,413
How are you?
Uh, great. You?

470
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,365
So gr...

471
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,067
Can we talk about this
for a second?

472
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,069
Yeah.

473
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:28,456
It is super-weird between us,
and I don't want it to be.

474
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,707
Me, neither.

475
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,709
So let me just say this.

476
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,261
I'm done.

477
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:35,680
You don't have
to worry anymore.

478
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:37,298
What do you mean?

479
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,017
I'm done trying to get you.

480
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,935
I can't do it anymore.

481
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:43,588
I'm sorry it's taken me
this long to figure it out,

482
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,423
but I promise...

483
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:48,426
I'm done making
a fool of myself.

484
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:50,278
Barney, you haven't been making
a fool out of yourself...

485
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:50,980
It's okay.

486
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,113
It's okay.

487
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:54,765
I want it to be okay.

488
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,117
So here's what's
gonna happen.

489
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,570
I'm gonna get us two drinks,

490
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,489
come back and comment
on the likely size and color

491
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,125
of the nipples
on that redhead at the bar,

492
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,077
with the big, dark nipples.

493
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,612
And you're gonna
be grossed out,

494
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:10,565
but you're gonna laugh
a little anyway, and then you'll tell

495
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,334
a funny story about
"that bitch Patrice" at work,

496
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,786
but neither one of us
are gonna say,

497
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:17,955
"Hey, how's it going?"
or "Good to see you!"

498
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:21,142
Because it really will be
good to see you.

499
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:24,795
Think we can swing that?

500
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:27,315
Yeah, I do.

501
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,068
Badass.

502
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:43,481
Huh.

503
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:51,013
Thanks for your support, guys.
It means a lot.

504
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,651
We'll call in sick anytime
you have a problem.

505
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:00,724
Lily coming!

506
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,459
Lily coming!

507
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:06,329
Badass.
