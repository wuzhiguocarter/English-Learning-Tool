1
00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:05,820
Well, it's come to this-- we're
drinking with our baby in a bar.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,393
It is not a bar.

3
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:10,178
It's a restaurant that
happens to have a bar.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,547
Ergo, we are good parents.

5
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:14,383
Unrelated: I'm getting
faced right now.

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:15,750
Papa needs a grease coat.

7
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:17,185
While it is
heartwarming to watch

8
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:19,421
your firstborn teethe
on a jalapeño popper,

9
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:21,189
wasn't Mickey
gonna watch him today?

10
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:22,190
My dad's out all week.

11
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:23,308
He's got the sniffles.

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,327
For someone who's survived
numerous beatings

13
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,812
from loan sharks, he has

14
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:29,764
a surprisingly
delicate constitution.

15
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:30,983
Well, my semester's over

16
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:32,734
and the GNB building
is finally done.

17
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:34,936
If you guys want,
I'm free to watch Marvin.

18
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:35,988
I'm meeting
with a headhunter

19
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,239
next week to line up

20
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:39,324
my next project,
but until then, what the hell?

21
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:42,461
Ted, although a "what
the hell" attitude is

22
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:44,579
incredibly sought
after in a babysitter,

23
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:46,214
I think that Lily
and Marshall...

24
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:47,466
You're hired.

25
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:49,117
Now that we've been

26
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,385
parents for awhile,
we realize

27
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:52,554
that pretty much any moron
can take care of a baby.

28
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:54,306
Thank you.

29
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:56,591
Mine!

30
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:57,625
Ow.

31
00:00:57,627 --> 00:00:59,144
Delicious and mine.

32
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:03,682
They do look yummy
yum-yum, mister.

33
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,821
No. No!

34
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:11,306
What have I done?!

35
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:14,359
I am so sorry, Cornelius.

36
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,695
You deserve
a better end than this!

37
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:18,813
You got ketchup
on a red tie.

38
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:20,115
You can't even see it.

39
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:26,788
Clear!

40
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,875
I'm going in.

41
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:35,297
Oh, my...

42
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,965
Damn it, guys,
we lost him.

43
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,017
And he was so close
to retirement.

44
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:41,219
Just this morning
he said to me,

45
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,889
"I'm getting too old
for this shirt."

46
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:48,176
I know, dude.

47
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,069
Oh, my God.

48
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:00,522
You are such
a good folder.

49
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:02,457
That's, like, The Gap good.

50
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,294
Robin...

51
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,881
...let's go hit the bar.

52
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:11,133
At this restaurant.

53
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:13,051
I think they have a bar here.

54
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:18,873
Okay, what was that?
What was what?

55
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,510
The "dumb cheerleader flirting
with the quarterback" thing.

56
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:22,644
You looked like
you were gonna

57
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:23,845
chase Barney down with

58
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,647
a sixer of watermelon
wine coolers.

59
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:28,400
First of all, those bad girls
come in fourskis.

60
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,987
And second, why would I
be flirting with Barney?

61
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,824
I'm not interested in him,
and I made that very clear.

62
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:38,076
With something that I did.

63
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,194
Recently.

64
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:40,395
Just spill it.

65
00:02:40,397 --> 00:02:42,781
<i>The other week,</i>
<i>Barney made a move,</i>

66
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,732
<i>but I turned him down.</i>

67
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:47,119
<i>I felt awful for closing</i>
<i>the door in his face,</i>

68
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:48,837
<i>but he realized I was right.</i>

69
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,672
I'm done trying to get you.

70
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:52,924
I can't do it anymore.

71
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,909
And now I get it.
Get what?

72
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:57,512
You may have closed the door
on Barney, but he locked it.

73
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,746
What? No, he didn't.

74
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,015
Yeah, he got the last word,

75
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:01,216
and now you want

76
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:03,251
what you can't have,
like you always do.

77
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:06,188
It's the classic
lobster situation.

78
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,973
I'm afraid
you're allergic to lobster.

79
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:11,926
You can never, ever, ever
have it.

80
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:22,770
Oh, this... is... delicious.

81
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,789
Once you learned
you couldn't have lobster,

82
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,324
you became obsessed.

83
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:27,325
Barney's the same thing.

84
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:29,411
And this is gonna
blow up in your face,

85
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,613
just like the lobster
blew up your face.

86
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:34,216
Wrong.
This is nothing like lobster.

87
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:35,617
Okay.

88
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,452
Just remember, you can never
hook up with Barney again.

89
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:38,720
That's fine.
Never.

90
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:44,476
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

93
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:59,774
Oh, no.

94
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:01,576
Marshall, Lily and
Ted can't make it,

95
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,328
for viable reasons
I just learned

96
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,014
via this text message
I accidentally deleted.

97
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,200
Guess it's just gonna be
you and me.

98
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:09,150
Fine by me.

99
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:11,486
Me, too. Totally.

100
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:12,587
Supafine.

101
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:16,291
<i>Hey there, Scherbats,</i>
<i>your voice of reason here.</i>

102
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:17,375
<i>What you doing?</i>

103
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:18,660
I hope you don't mind,

104
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,962
but I was hungry, so I ordered
MacLaren's new special.

105
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:24,499
I couldn't eat lunch at work
because they ordered

106
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,051
Thai food.

107
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:28,002
I miss you, Cornelius!

108
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:30,138
Oh, my God.

109
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,439
You're so sensitive.

110
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:32,691
And deep.

111
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,477
<i>No. You're better than this.</i>

112
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,113
<i>Barney is not like lobster.</i>

113
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,848
<i>Okay, that's unfortunate,</i>
<i>but it doesn't mean</i>

114
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,016
<i>you have to hook up</i>
<i>with Barney.</i>

115
00:04:42,018 --> 00:04:42,867
Whoa!

116
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,352
<i>God, you said that out loud!</i>

117
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:45,570
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

118
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:47,322
<i>How would you know?</i>
<i>You're out of control.</i>

119
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,242
<i>Oh, you think you're so smart,</i>
<i>don't you, bitch?</i>

120
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:53,411
Um, billion-dollar idea alert.

121
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:56,131
Why should bibs
only be socially acceptable

122
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,132
when you're eating lobster?

123
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,866
If we could wear them
all the time,

124
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,468
then Corny would still be

125
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,254
with us right now.

126
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:03,972
I miss...

127
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:08,143
Picture a bib
that looks like your suit:

128
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:10,345
a collar, a tie, a jacket.

129
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,263
Mm-hmm.

130
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,214
<i>Atta girl. Keep it cool.</i>

131
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:16,217
I could call them Brobibs!

132
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,719
That's interesting.

133
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,604
<i>Yeah, you got this.</i>

134
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,107
<i>I'm sorry I called you a bitch.</i>

135
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:23,191
What do you think?

136
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:26,161
Oh, that idea's amazeballs!

137
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:28,580
<i>That's it. I'm out of here.</i>

138
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:33,985
I'm out of control.

139
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:35,003
I came this close

140
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:36,338
to telling Barney
that I wanted him.

141
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,441
Robin, as your friend,
I got to be honest.

142
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:42,711
I think this Brobibs thing
is a frickin' gold mine.

143
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:43,745
What? No.

144
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,513
Lily, I really need advice.

145
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,514
Okay.

146
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:47,799
Invest now.

147
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:50,719
Seriously, it's like Apple
at ten dollars a share.

148
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,720
Lily, please.

149
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,221
Okay, I'm sorry.

150
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,806
I'm just,
I'm a little distracted.

151
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:56,224
I-I got to get upstairs

152
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:58,259
and check on
Ted and Marvin.

153
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:02,063
Can we please just talk about
this Brobib thing another time?

154
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:06,034
How was your day?

155
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,102
Good, although I think
I just saw a woman

156
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,071
with a full beard outside.

157
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:11,373
Marvin crawled!

158
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,440
What?

159
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:13,775
He's never done that before.

160
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:15,026
I know!

161
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:18,112
I think I just saw a guy
with breasts outside.

162
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,831
Marvin crawled.

163
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,449
I can't believe it.
Believe it.

164
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,634
I took a video for you.

165
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:25,253
You're doing it, Marvin.

166
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,455
Go, go, go, go, go.

167
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:28,923
Oh!

168
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:31,593
Your Uncle Ted is so proud.

169
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:32,644
Whoops.

170
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,062
Guess I had the camera flipped.

171
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,682
I use it to
check my teeth for debris.

172
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,937
Ooh, sounds like
somebody's "crawling" me.

173
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,493
Oh, sweetie, oh, come on.

174
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,196
Lil, listen, so we missed
the first time he crawled.

175
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,530
So what?

176
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:54,499
We'll see it the
next time, I promise.

177
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,117
Oh, my God,
he just did it again!

178
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,379
Guys, get in here!
Marvin can't stop crawling!

179
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,811
He's Holden Crawl-field!

180
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:10,648
Get in here right now--
nope, nope, it's over.

181
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,485
Okay, hey, I know.

182
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,254
Baby, I know, I know.

183
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:19,090
But, listen, there will be
plenty of other Marvin firsts.

184
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:20,258
His first day
at school,

185
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,327
his first trip to meet Santa,

186
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:24,129
his first
touchdown pass for

187
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,381
the 2032 Super Bowl champion
Vikings-- no pressure.

188
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:29,184
I'll love him even if he runs
the ball into the end zone.

189
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:32,503
So can we please just let
this crawling thing go?

190
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:33,889
Yeah, okay. You're right.

191
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,640
I mean, I'm being nuts.

192
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:37,275
We'll see it when we see it.

193
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:38,310
Yeah.

194
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:39,744
Do it.

195
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:41,846
If you ever want to
see these boobs again,

196
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,815
crawl, you son of a me.

197
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,450
Come on, Lil.

198
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:49,371
You know what they say:
a watched tot never crawls.

199
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:53,158
Or calls you later in life,

200
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,126
after it sees
this disturbing footage.

201
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:58,129
Hey, Lily, Marshall.

202
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:59,664
Uh, Lily, we need to talk.

203
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,666
Oh, that sounds serious!

204
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:02,901
Oh, you guys should
talk about it

205
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:04,920
down at the bar
until after Marvin's asleep.

206
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,371
And if you want to
stay down there until

207
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:07,639
after SportsCenter's over,
that's fine, too.

208
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,842
Ooh.

209
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:11,843
Keep shooting.

210
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:14,012
If you miss it,
I'm leaving you.

211
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:22,871
Yeah, that seems
about right.

212
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:24,990
Sorry if I'm
bad company.

213
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,274
I'm not sure anything is gonna

214
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:29,160
take my mind off of missing
Marvin's first crawl.

215
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:31,529
Lily, I've had a revelation.

216
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:32,948
Brobibs for women.

217
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,332
Bitchbibs!

218
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,566
You know Barney's gonna sue us,

219
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,285
but damn it,
let's just go for it.

220
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,569
No, Lily, this is serious.

221
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:41,039
When that doctor told me
I couldn't eat lobster

222
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,291
and I did it anyway,
it almost killed me.

223
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,509
But here's the thing:

224
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:46,911
I never wanted lobster again.

225
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:48,346
So the solution is obvious.

226
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,682
The only way to get
Barney out of my system

227
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:54,803
is to get him into my system,
one last time.

228
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,221
It's brilliant, right?

229
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:57,422
Not brilliant at all.

230
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,391
Thanks for being on board.
Not on board.

231
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:01,026
It means a lot.
Big mistake.

232
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:02,894
You're my girl.

233
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:07,198
Now it's just a question
of how to get him...

234
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:11,653
Hey, Robin,
I just got your text.

235
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:12,871
What's the big emergency?

236
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:13,872
Hi, Barney!

237
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,407
You seem like you run fast.

238
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,442
Do you want me to fan you
with my <i>US</i> magazine?

239
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:19,210
He's fine.
Thanks, Patrice.

240
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,964
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

241
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,883
I just got this
new printer,

242
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,418
and I need somebody
big and strong

243
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,003
to take it to my office for me.

244
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:30,588
I promise to repay you.

245
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,290
We'll do it
for you, Robin!

246
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:35,393
Don't you have a late-breaking
weather story to cover, Brandi?

247
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:37,128
Oh, I did it already.

248
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,129
It rained.

249
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,631
Oh, I got to jump on

250
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,267
a big Brobibs
conference call.

251
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:45,820
The lawyer from Dude Aprons
is really busting my balls.

252
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:46,988
See ya.

253
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:51,476
Nobody asked
for your help, Patrice!

254
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:54,779
You either, Brandi!

255
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,316
Stop it.

256
00:09:58,318 --> 00:09:59,534
Hey, hey.

257
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:02,287
What are you guys doing
slobbering all over my friend?

258
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,539
Oh, Barney, don't be jealous.

259
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,009
If you're gonna drool,
do it in style!

260
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:11,463
Just go to Brobibs.com.

261
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,848
We've got every look
in the book.

262
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,135
The Business Casual.

263
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:19,270
The Preppy.

264
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:23,274
The Robin Williams.

265
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:27,779
Bib up!

266
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,280
Brobibs is in no way
affiliated with,

267
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:31,616
inspired by or derivative of
Dude Aprons.

268
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,289
Hey, there.

269
00:10:39,158 --> 00:10:40,392
Hey!

270
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:43,461
It is so good to see you.

271
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,464
Thanks, Robin.

272
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:49,000
This game affects my
league score.

273
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:54,589
Look, I don't agree
with your lobster quest,

274
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,509
but I can't stand watching you
make a fool of yourself.

275
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,044
You want the fix?
I got the fix.

276
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:01,679
Back in college...

277
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:04,399
<i>it was love at first sight</i>

278

♪

282
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:18,580
Let's get
out of here.

283
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,867
You just need a girl
who, I don't know,

284
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:25,170
gets a few drinks in her
and wants to have fun

285
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:26,621
and put on a show.
Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:29,240
And it drives guys crazy,
'cause you both

287
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:30,592
don't even care.

288
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,877
It's just stupid and fun.

289
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,913
Lily, that sounds perfect.
Thank you.

290
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:38,349
Mm. Just stupid.

291
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:40,585
Stupid and fun.

292
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,194
Who the hell is that?

293
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,545
Hey, guys.

294
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:53,882
Barney, this is Brandi,
my fun friend from work,

295
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:55,766
who just doesn't even care.

296
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:58,069
Hello, Brandi.

297
00:11:58,071 --> 00:12:00,071
Congratulations on the gig.

298
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,105
Aw, thank you!

299
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:03,241
World Wide News is
an amazing place to work.

300
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:06,578
Not that gig, sweetheart.

301
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,152
Marshall!

302
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:16,971
What? Ow.

303
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,089
It's late.

304
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:19,924
I'm so tipsy.

305
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,794
It is late.
We should get out of here.

306
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:29,818
So, Brandi, ever sneak
into the studio

307
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
and do it in front of
the weather map?

308
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,605
No. Why do you ask?

309
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,073
No reason.

310
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:40,144
Someone is about to get
unseasonably banged.

311
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,165
Damn it!

312
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:45,583
What did I do wrong?

313
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:48,486
Nothing. It was awesome.
Oh, Marshall, let's go!

314
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,843
Hey.
Hey, Lilypad!

315
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,344
So, don't be upset.

316
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:57,345
Ted...

317
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:59,347
took Marvin shopping

318
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:01,966
and sort of bought him...

319
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,935
all his winter clothes.

320
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,937
Get ready

321
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:07,455
for our star runway model--

322
00:13:07,457 --> 00:13:10,425
or should I say,
our star <i>crawlway</i> model.

323
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:12,060
He's doing it again, guys!
Get in here!

324
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:14,362
N-No-no, it's over.

325
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:16,281
That's it. Ted's fired.

326
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,400
Fired? No, c-come on, Lily,
he's helping us out.

327
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:20,785
Plus, next week,
your dad'll be back,

328
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:22,954
and Ted has the meeting
with that headhunter.

329
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:24,689
Let's just stay cool.

330
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:26,824
Starting at quarterback,

331
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:29,077
the pride of Cleveland...

332
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,196
Marvin Eriksen!
Right?

333
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:34,966
Right, guys? He's gonna be
a little Browns fan.

334
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:39,170
Oh, by the way, I cancelled that
meeting with the headhunter,

335
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:41,205
so I can take care
of Marvin next week.

336
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,541
What? No, no, my dad'll
be better by then.

337
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,143
Oh, I gave Mickey the month off.

338
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:48,012
It's supposed to snow, and, uh,
Uncle Ted doesn't want to miss

339
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:49,681
Marvin's first sleigh ride.

340
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:51,182
You're fired.
You're fired.

341
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:01,415
Marvin has a bib with little...
little dinosaurs on it.

342
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,250
Maybe you should
make one like that.

343
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,920
Brobibs are for grown men
wearing bibs, Ted.

344
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:08,389
I don't want them
looking like idiots.

345
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,127
Lily, Marshall, you know you
can't keep him away from me.

346
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:14,595
He's gonna start
asking questions.

347
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:15,729
Calm down, Ted.

348
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,297
We-we just wanted
to apologize.

349
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,816
We overreacted before.

350
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:19,967
Mm-hmm.

351
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:21,352
Meet us

352
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:24,304
at the swim class you
apparently signed Marvin up for.

353
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:25,940
Bubble Buddies?
I'd love t...

354
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,359
I mean, I'll have
to check my skedge.

355
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:30,477
Sorry. When I'm excited,

356
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:31,662
I abbreviate words I shouldn't.

357
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:32,913
Come on, Ted,

358
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,031
what do you say?

359
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,416
Fab. Perf.

360
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:36,200
Sorry.

361
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:37,651
See you at B-Buds.

362
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:39,319
Bubble Buddies. Sorry.

363
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,591
Augie. Jayden.

364
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,211
Dylan. Girl Dylan.

365
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,596
Hey, Ted.
Hey. Where's Marvin?

366
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,182
Does Coach Amber have him
warming up in the Jacooz?

367
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,550
Sorry again.

368
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:56,971
Aw, hey, buddy, listen,
we wanted to talk to you

369
00:14:56,973 --> 00:15:00,140
about how you've kind of been
overdoing it with Marvin.

370
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:01,642
I haven't been overdoing it.

371
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:03,827
Ted, we're in
a baby swim class,

372
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,696
and clearly you've
done something extreme

373
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,449
to get the naming rights
to that lollipop bin.

374
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:11,518
But I-I think that we've

375
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,186
figured out what's
going on with you.

376
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:14,788
See, after we
let you go...

377
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,490
What is <i>this?</i>

378
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:18,709
<i>Marvin's</i> <i>Book of Firsts?</i>

379
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,639
Ted took Marvin
to see Santa?!

380
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,475
Oh, I am gonna
take this book

381
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,643
and I'm gonna shove it
so far up his...

382
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,512
The point is,
it made us remember

383
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,213
another scrapbook you made.

384
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,060
That project really
was your baby,

385
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,396
and now it's over, and
you're scared to move on.

386
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:59,700
I poured my blood, sweat
and tears into that building.

387
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:01,568
Though, to be fair,
a lot of that happened

388
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,787
the day I accidentally fell
down the elevator shaft.

389
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:04,788
Mm.

390
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,906
The point is,

391
00:16:05,908 --> 00:16:07,257
it's just really hard to let go.

392
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,510
Especially when that building's
my biggest accomplishment.

393
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:10,711
I mean,

394
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:13,097
maybe if I was where
you guys are at in life,

395
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:15,349
with all you have
to be proud of...

396
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,220
We get it, okay?

397
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:22,556
You're always gonna be
Uncle Ted.

398
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:23,941
But if Marvin

399
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,509
can't be your next project,

400
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,444
you need one of your own,

401
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,647
and so we rescheduled
your meeting with that headhunter.

402
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,117
He's over there.

403
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,653
Which one is he?

404
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,239
Thanks, guys.

405
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,041
Marvin and I are lucky
you're our parents.

406
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,493
Aw.

407
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,411
Oh, hey, Ted?

408
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,163
It's kind of a big,
professional meeting--

409
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:48,248
you might want to trade out
that lollipop

410
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,950
for a shirt.
Yeah.

411
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:52,619
I'll just give it to one of these kids.
Oh, buddy.

412
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:53,921
What?
You're half naked,

413
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,957
you're not a parent to
any of these children--

414
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,892
don't offer 'em candy.

415
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,563
I can't believe Barney
went home with Brandi.

416
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:05,099
I should have asked <i>you</i>
to do that play with me.

417
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,484
Well, it's too late now,
isn't it?

418
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,302
There he is. Straddle me.
Start grinding.

419
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,521
Nothing's off-limits.

420
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,657
So, last night

421
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,193
Brandi and I got
to the WWN studios,

422
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:18,278
and my high-pressure system

423
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,281
was ready to slam
into her warm front.

424
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,950
The studio's unlocked,

425
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,118
the weather map's up--

426
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,753
ready to do it in 17
different states at once?

427
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,823
Um, actually...

428
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:32,209
I don't think I want that.

429
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:34,845
I'm sorry.

430
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,996
I'm-I'm...

431
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:37,631
I'm gonna go.

432
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,601
Wait, you didn't
sleep with her?

433
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:41,685
Nope.

434
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,520
I spent the night
thinking about

435
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:46,723
how everything I've done
since Quinn and I broke up

436
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,809
has been a cry for help.

437
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,694
Dressing a dog up like me,

438
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,396
hooking up with
all those nannies...

439
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:54,615
Brobibs?
No, those are solid.

440
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:55,616
I still want in.

441
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:58,852
And I realized that...
I'm searching,

442
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:01,655
searching for what
I really want in life,

443
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:03,040
and you know what?

444
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,960
I have absolutely
no idea what that is.

445
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,213
Wow.

446
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:11,364
Barney...
But...

447
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:13,634
I'm going
to figure it out.

448
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:15,469
I have to.

449
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,838
Good night, guys.

450
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,726
God, I feel awful.

451
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:23,594
Barney is

452
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:24,978
going through something big,

453
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,898
and I've been obsessing
about one stupid final hookup

454
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,067
to get him out of my system.

455
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,886
He needs space...

456
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,055
and time to figure things out.

457
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:37,057
And I have to give it to him.

458
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,578
Robin? What are you doing here?
It's okay

459
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,498
if you don't know
what you want in life...

460
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,286
...as long as you know
what you want...

461
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,405
tonight.

462
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:54,291
Well...

463
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:56,760
I do know what I want.

464
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,747
Hi, Robin!

465
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:04,084
Nobody asked you
here, Patrice!

466
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,721
Actually, I did.

467
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:09,389
Last night.

468
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,475
Let me go see if
the studio's open.

469
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,760
All right.

470
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,431
Oh, hi, Barney.

471
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm working late.

472
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:21,568
What are you doing here?

473
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,705
I'm...

474
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:27,791
I don't know what
I'm doing... here.

475
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,828
Barney... I don't know
you that well, but...

476
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,580
are you okay?

477
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,782
Yeah. What do you mean?

478
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:37,167
Well, whenever I see
someone unhappy,

479
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,086
I get the urge
to give them cookies,

480
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:41,638
and I really want
to give you cookies right now.

481
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,092
Cookie?

482
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:47,794
Lame. No, thanks.

483
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:49,629
You sure?
They're heart-shaped.

484
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,932
Sorry, a couple
of them are broken.

485
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:55,468
I know how they feel.
I'd love one.

486
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,470
After that,
I sent Brandi packing,

487
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,823
and Patrice and I
talked all night.

488
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:00,857
We're...

489
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:03,860
kind of on a
date right now.

490
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:06,163
But if you'd like
to throw on some clothes

491
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:07,497
and join us for Crazy Eights...

492
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,782
I can deal you in!

493
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,817
My deck has puppies on it!

494
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:12,202
Arf-arf!

495
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,323
Um...

496
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,875
I...

497
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:20,877
got to go.

498
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:27,775
Look, I still feel bad
I went too far

499
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,210
with all the Marvin firsts--
the Santa thing, especially.

500
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:32,707
I mean,
I should've known.

501
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,275
Are you sure
you guys forgive me?

502
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,444
Absolutely.
Don't worry, no grudges.

503
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,529
Great.
Next round's on me.

504
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,617
Coming, honey!

505
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,203
Okay, you guys have
all the numbers-- my cell,

506
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:47,505
the restaurant,
Center for Disease Control?

507
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,924
She's with her Aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall.

508
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:51,959
Nothing's gonna happen.

509
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,044
You're right.

510
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:54,045
You're totally right.

511
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:55,546
Okay...

512
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:56,580
Bye, sweetie.

513
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:57,849
Here, you...

514
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,051
Mm...

515
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:04,105
Get out of here, ya crazy.
Would you get out of here already.

516
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,629
Who's ready to meet Santa?
