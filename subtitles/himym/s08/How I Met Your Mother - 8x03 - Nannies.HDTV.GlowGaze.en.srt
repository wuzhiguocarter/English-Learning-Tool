1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,837
<i>Robin:
So, the hairdresser shows up</i>

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,538
At 2:00 on Sunday.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,007
Great, and while you do that,

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,174
I'll check in
on the ring bear.

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,110
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,947
You're saying
"ring bearer," right?

7
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,382
Ring bear.

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,051
Okay, look into my eyes and say,
"I promise that I'm not bringing

9
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,686
A dangerous wild animal
to our wedding."

10
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,156
I...

11
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,059
Oh, that's the shuttle

12
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,994
With our elderly relatives
pulling up.

13
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,397
There's nine steps between
the bus and that front door,

14
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,998
Which means we've only got
about 45 minutes

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,233
Until they get inside.

16
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,368
We won't have a
moment to ourselves

17
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,004
Once those old bastards
latch onto us like leeches,

18
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,572
But they're family
and I love them.

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,808
living link to history.

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,076
Oh, god.

21
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,310
This is gonna be rough.

22
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,745
My great-grandparents

23
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,814
Never stop bickering,
but I guess that's

24
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,983
What happens when you've
been married for 60 years.

25
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,818
60 years.

26
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,087
Man, when was the last time
you think they had sex?

27
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,924
Probably not since the
maple leafs won the cup.

28
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,193
1967.

29
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,996
That's not gonna be us, right?

30
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:08,067
Like, when we get married,
it's not all fighting, no sex?

31
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,035
What? No way.

32
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,938
It's us, r-train and b-nasty.

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,908
That will never happen.

34
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,113
Both:
We have to have sex right now.

35
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,082
Aw.

36
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,764
<i>Narrator: Kids, as you
recall, uncle marshall</i>

37
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,066
<i>Had gotten kicked off
his flight home from minnesota</i>

38
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,635
<i>And was now high-tailing it
across the country</i>

39
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,071
<i>With another stranded traveler
named daphne.</i>

40
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,072
How's it going, baby?

41
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,073
Fine.

42
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,775
Except the flames of lucifer

43
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,777
Keep singeing our back bumper
as we drive

44
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,147
Through this hellish,
cheese-infested wasteland.

45
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,416
Wisconsin?
Wisconsin!

46
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,984
Packers country.

47
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,419
But don't worry,

48
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,921
The eriksen men are repping
the purple and gold

49
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,456
Like two bosses.

50
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,659
Go, vikings!

51
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,097
And how are you doing, daphne?

52
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,500
Not bad, considering
marshall's been spouting

53
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,568
Vikings trivia
for the last hour.

54
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,970
Do you know
"I don't care"

55
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,005
Led the league last year

56
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,574
In "dumb sports stuff"?

57
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,575
Marshall:
Anyways, listen,

58
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,643
I should be back in time

59
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,978
For the rehearsal dinner
tomorrow.

60
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,412
Oh, the rehearsal dinner.

61
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,282
Daphne, you should have seen
the dress I was gonna wear.

62
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,751
Up top,
it packed the gals together

63
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,354
<i>Like opening night
of a sex and the city movie.</i>

64
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,923
And down south,
it made mama look like a dream

65
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,926
Sir mix-a-lot would never want
to wake up from.

66
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,762
Ooh, what happened
to that dress?

67
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,603
The drunks at the dry cleaners
destroyed it.

68
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,041
Thank you, linus.

69
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,476
Okay, lily, I have to go.

70
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:00,145
I have to alert the villagers
that there is

71
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,980
A viking amongst them.

72
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,615
Oh...

73
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,120
Marshall's driving
through wisconsin? Yep.

74
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,023
Ooh, is that
your toast?

75
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,891
Uh... Yeah.
Yeah, I'm just

76
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,993
Gonna wing mine.
'cause if you get up there

77
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,562
And speak from the heart...

78
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,497
Things good...

79
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,165
Mouth words...

80
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,300
Memory

81
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,301
Times.

82
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,902
Can I take a peek
at your speech?

83
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,504
Uh, no. I...

84
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:29,341
"have a drink
with my favorite students,

85
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,010
See one last sunset
over the hudson."

86
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,712
Ted, your speech sucks.

87
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,049
Well, it's no "mouth words,
memory times."

88
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,085
But if you must know,
it's, uh... It's not a speech.

89
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,221
What is it, then?

90
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,923
<i>Narrator: A week before the
wedding, I realized I couldn't stay</i>

91
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,725
<i>In new york any longer.</i>

92
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,995
<i>So I decided to start fresh
in chicago.</i>

93
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,830
It's a list of all the things

94
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,599
I want to do
before I leave new york.

95
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,667
Okay, I don't know
which I hate more:

96
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,236
The fact that you're moving away

97
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,738
Or the fact that I'm the only
one that knows about it.

98
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,406
Why won't you tell anyone?

99
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,776
You don't drop a bombshell like
that this close to a wedding.

100
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,713
No, that's an excuse. You have
been avoiding barney and robin

101
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,081
Since the carousel.

102
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,282
And now
on Monday,

103
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,884
You're running away to chicago.

104
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,119
I'm not running away.

105
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:15,787
I'm moving on.

106
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,191
This list isn't written by
someone who's ready to move on.

107
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,027
It's written by someone
who loves new york.

108
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,530
I mean, "fix graffiti
on 96th and amsterdam"?

109
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,633
I hated looking at it.

110
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,109
"buy the whole bar
a round of drinks."

111
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,110
Mm-hmm.

112
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,411
Hey, everyone.

113
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,912
Next round's on me!

114
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,916
Yeah!

115
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,018
Ted?

116
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,620
Hey, everyone.

117
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,289
Next round's on me!

118
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,924
Can I have a double bourbon...

119
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,494
No doubles!

120
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,297
"say good-bye
to the empire state building."

121
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,965
Bro.

122
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,400
What?

123
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,168
Sometimes I go...

124
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,771
Talk to her about life.

125
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,406
Ted:
And I just hate the thought

126
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,808
Of leaving you, empy,

127
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,811
But my gut tells me
my future's in chicago.

128
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,613
What do you think?

129
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,148
You need to move.

130
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,749
Oh, my god, r-really?

131
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,950
Are-are you sure?

132
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,152
Yeah, I'm sure.

133
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,920
You can't just
stand there talking

134
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,989
To a building and petting it.

135
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,425
Wait, are you one
of those freaks

136
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,660
Who's sexually attracted
to buildings?

137
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,095
An objectophiliac?

138
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,164
No way.

139
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,599
Then why do you know
what they're called?

140
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,902
Why do you know
what they're called?

141
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Wait. Wait, wait. You know
what would really prove

142
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,809
We're not some old married couple? Mmm.

143
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,111
Doing it somewhere
we're not supposed to.

144
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,679
no, not what I mean.

145
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,548
Oh. Like the elevator
or the pool cabana.

146
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,116
Uh, how about the roof?
Oh...

147
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,121
Man:
Who gets married this far away?

148
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,789
Woman:
And the humidity.

149
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,157
Both
They're here.

150
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,094
What do you say we make
this bang a home game? Yes.

151
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,663
We're locked out.

152
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,031
I guess we could try
the back door.

153
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,632
of our suite.

154
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:08,867
Oh.
There's a back door.

155
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,868
No, I locked it.

156
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,902
okay, it's fine.

157
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,070
We'll race down
to the front desk

158
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,238
And get a key
before anyone notices us.

159
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,676
Too late. It's like we're
in a zombie movie.

160
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,877
Seriously.

161
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,145
They move at
a slow shuffle,

162
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,646
They moan a lot and,
if given the chance,

163
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,014
They chew your ear off.

164
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,583
But they're family
and I love 'em.

165
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,917
Their wisdom is priceless.

166
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,920
"finally tell
my upstairs neighbor

167
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,690
How I've been feeling
all this time."

168
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,091
Yeah.

169
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,895
Hi. Um, I live
downstairs,

170
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,698
And, well, I've always wanted
to say this to you, but...

171
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,199
I've never had the guts.

172
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,236
So here goes.

173
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,838
Are your shoes made of lead?!

174
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,008
Because you are the loudest
upstairs neighbor in history!

175
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,778
Oh, oh, and you suck
at the bongos! But, hey...

176
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,579
keep practicing!

177
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,081
In the middle of the night!

178
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,983
Before any important interview
I've ever had!

179
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,687
"come clean about April 26."

180
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,223
What happened April 26?

181
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,526
Uh...

182
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,028
Can you believe people used to
actually swim in those things?

183
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,730
"meet me at coney island, see?

184
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,132
"I'll be doing the charleston
atop my giant-wheeled bicycle

185
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,735
In an era where folks
inexplicably talked like this."

186
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,706
Ted.

187
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,444
Whoa.
hey.

188
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,446
Hey, bud, I was just
about to take, uh,

189
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,481
Lily's rehearsal dinner dress
to the dry cleaner.

190
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,916
Oh, that's too bad.

191
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,251
<i>Because, uh, I was just watching
the princess bride</i>

192
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,053
When something occurred to me.

193
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,889
How, at the end, andre the giant
hooks 'em up with those horses

194
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,157
And then inigo montoya is like,

195
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,928
"fezzik, you did something
right." and it's like,

196
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,398
"bro, andre's been doing
stuff right the whole movie:

197
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,067
"knocking out serpents,
busting down castle doors,

198
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,903
"basically carrying your
revenge-and-sangria-soaked ass,

199
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,972
"so instead of being
a patronizing jerk,

200
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,907
"how about a simple,

201
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,910
'hey, thanks
for the horses, bro.'"

202
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,112
That's totally
what you were thinking, right?

203
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,015
No, I... No, I came over...

204
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,984
God, that's a really good point.

205
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,185
Yeah.

206
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,921
But here's my point.

207
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,490
And your point.

208
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:15,093
why haven't we done this
in forever?

209
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,829
Ted, you know damn well
why we haven't.

210
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,371
Sorry, lily.
Sorry, lily.

211
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,006
I almost killed my wife, ted!

212
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,675
I almost killed my wife!

213
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,010
I almost...

214
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,147
Yah!

215
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,148
"hello!

216
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,617
My name is inigo montoya!"

217
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,985
"you killed my father."

218
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,987
"prepare to die!"
"prepare to die!"

219
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,629
Ted:
Whoa.

220
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,964
You son of a bitch.

221
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,139
I loved that dress
you cut in half.

222
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:06,011
It was the perfect combination
of slutty and classy.

223
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,412
Well, what about
your backup dress?

224
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,181
Oh, it's just classy, ted!

225
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,019
Thank you, linus.

226
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,487
Look, I'm really sorry.

227
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,721
No, it's not good enough.

228
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,056
Since I'm being

229
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,425
Forced to wear something
I don't want to,

230
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,029
You should have to wear
something you don't

231
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,064
Want to.

232
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,770
Why am I the only one
being punished?

233
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,672
Marshall's just as responsible
for your dress as I am.

234
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,673
Yeah, but he's

235
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,907
In the middle of wisconsin.

236
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,577
How am I gonna punish...

237
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,312
Daphne:
Say cheese!

238
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,982
Go, pack, go!

239
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,422
I'm sorry, dad.

240
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,058
There's got to be someplace to
bang around here. I'm starving.

241
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,125
I knew we should've hit
the buffet when...

242
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,294
don't say "buffet."

243
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,463
That attracts old people.
Same goes for "coupon,"

244
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,398
<i>"60 minutes"
and "mandy patinkin."</i>

245
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,634
W... Robin,
you're being paranoid.

246
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,636
Old people don't magically
sense it

247
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,038
When you say "mandy patinkin."

248
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,408
Patinkin...

249
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,810
Quick, the ice machine room.

250
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,545
It's too cold for them in there. Oh.

251
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,117
I'll protect you, robin.

252
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,286
You'll always be safe with me.

253
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,155
take her!

254
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,093
You bitches best get out
of my hiding spot.

255
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,962
The only thing not checked off
on this list is

256
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,099
"scotch with barney."
that's the easiest one on here.

257
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,468
<i>You aavoiding him.</i>

258
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,470
I'm not. We've both been busy.

259
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,139
Besides, marshall and I
are saving that scotch

260
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,141
To have a drink with barney
before the rehearsal dinner.

261
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,478
Because it's not just
any bottle.

262
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,115
It's a $600
glen mckenna 30-year.

263
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,084
<i>Narrator: What I didn't
know at the time was...</i>

264
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,789
I told those idiots these
death rods are not welcome here.

265
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,992
What is it with
dudes and swords?

266
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,094
Oh, this is fun.

267
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,097
Oh, yeah, and it's so cool
when I go like this.

268
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,304
Hi. My name is rodrigo degoya.

269
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,472
You killed someone I love!

270
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,374
Prepare to dance!

271
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:20,178
<i>Narrator: Yes, kids, that's what
your aunt lily thought the line was.</i>

272
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,048
Ha! Whoo!

273
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,719
Ha!

274
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,290
We'll switch it with this
cheap bottle of whiskey.

275
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,125
You peel the label
off the glen mckenna.

276
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:34,993
On it!

277
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,895
Then we'll pour the... Robin!

278
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,563
Damn, that's smooth.

279
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,199
Pour it into
the other bottle!

280
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,206
Wait. The color's
not dark enough.

281
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:55,914
Still not right.

282
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,816
I think it was a little redder. Mm-hmm.

283
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,990
Okay, now
the consistency's off.

284
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,363
Yeah.

285
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,232
Looks good.

286
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,102
I mean, look at the color.

287
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,671
It's almost
chocolaty in its richness.

288
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,973
The reddish hue.

289
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,210
Something that looks
sort of clumpy.

290
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,878
Oh, yeah, I-I read about that.

291
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,683
Isn't the highland region
known for its clumps?

292
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,618
Thanks, lily.

293
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,755
I'm very aware
of the highland clumps.

294
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,090
You know what?
I think I'm gonna sneak a taste.

295
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,227
What? But-but marshall's
not even here yet!

296
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,263
Ah, a quick nip won't hurt.

297
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,635
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

298
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,284
She's breathtaking.

299
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,920
You avoiding
the family, too?

300
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,957
I'm gay, I'm black,
and I'm getting a divorce.

301
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,260
Those walking skeletons are
gonna have more questions for me

302
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,295
Than their pharmacist.

303
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,230
But they're family
and I love 'em.

304
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,632
The greatest generation.

305
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,567
Smother me before
I'm that age.

306
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,902
What are you two doing?

307
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,136
Oh, we're trying
to do it

308
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,638
Someplace naughty.

309
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,639
Not what I mean!

310
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,107
That-that is never
what I mean!

311
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,143
We're trying to sneak in
one last bang

312
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,145
'cause we're afraid
that the magic

313
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,281
Might fade
after we get married.

314
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,749
Are we being crazy?

315
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,018
That is what happened
with me and tom.

316
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,988
But it doesn't mean
it's gonna happen to you.

317
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,123
I won't let it.

318
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,625
Whoa-whoa, you can't
go out there.

319
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,093
It's suicide.

320
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,162
Consider it
your early wedding gift.

321
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,002
Why does the brother
always die first?

322
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,406
Aunt muriel!

323
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,049
Aunt muriel!

324
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,118
Aunt muriel?

325
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,119
James!

326
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,120
Where's tom?

327
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,789
I have a gay question for you.

328
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,025
How do you decide
which one...?

329
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,460
No, no...

330
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,495
No! He's gone, barney. He's gone.

331
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,563
James!

332
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,501
Okay, you go check out

333
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,036
The second floor
for open rooms.

334
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,905
I'm gonna go
check out the gym.

335
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,673
No, no, no, that
gym has a sauna!

336
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,343
You know my papa sid can't go
ten minutes without a schvitz!

337
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,410
What about the
gazebo out back?

338
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,845
Next to the lawn bowling court?

339
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,247
Get your head out of your ass.

340
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,182
<i>It looks like they're casting
cocoon three out there.</i>

341
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,150
Oh, what about
the business center?

342
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,186
A room full of computers?
That's perfect.

343
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,223
Technology is their
compression-sock-covered achilles heel!

344
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,559
Whoa.
What?

345
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,594
Stay safe, r-train.
You too, b-nasty.

346
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,695
Mmm...
Mmm...

347
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:58,763
Ah!

348
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,166
Ooh, my, I found waldo.

349
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,971
What's this list?

350
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,379
Whose is this?

351
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,248
<i>Narrator:
I was faced with a tough call:</i>

352
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,783
<i>Come clean about chicago</i>

353
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,052
<i>Or cleverly lie my way
out of it.</i>

354
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:24,789
Oh, well, you see...

355
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,124
Mouth words...

356
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,191
Memory times...

357
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,227
It's mine. It's my list.

358
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,063
It's everything I want to do
before I go to Italy.

359
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,300
Oh. You want to say good-bye
to the empire state building?

360
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,804
Sometimes I go
and I talk to empy.

361
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,872
That's kind of weird.

362
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:42,073
Is "weird" the right word?

363
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,875
Seems pretty
reasonable to me.

364
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,110
Maybe even kind of cool.

365
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,546
"have a drink
with my favorite students."

366
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,248
Lily, you taught kindergarten.

367
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,051
That does seem
pretty irresponsible.

368
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,720
"come clean about April 26."

369
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,822
You told ted
about our sword fight?

370
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,490
Wait- you-you guys
had a sword fight?

371
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,625
Maybe a tiny one.

372
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,094
I was pretending
to be mandy patinkin.

373
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,563
Patinkin.

374
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,572
But it was no big deal.

375
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,007
No big deal?

376
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,009
We destroyed
their 30-year glen mckenna

377
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,278
And replaced it with cheap
booze, ketchup and hand sanny.

378
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,279
I knew it!

379
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,280
You knew nothing!

380
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,316
Hello.

381
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,019
The third floor's a ghost town,
tons of empty rooms to bang in.

382
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,187
Hurry. I've started without you.

383
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,989
I mean, I love you.

384
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:31,956
Got to go.

385
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,524
Bye.

386
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:36,928
We made it.

387
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,966
Muriel:
Remind me to put

388
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:45,269
A five-dollar bill in
barney's wedding card,

389
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,338
You know,
to get 'em started.

390
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,811
Man:
No, elizabeth.

391
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,947
Leave the dentures in.

392
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,515
Woman:
Mmm!

393
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,019
Both:
I never want to have sex again.

394
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,121
Aw.

395
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,692
They broke our $600
bottle of scotch?

396
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,595
Well, I'm not wearing
this abomination anymore.

397
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,932
Put it back on.

398
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,078
I can't believe my great-
grandparents still do that.

399
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,746
I never imagined
a walker being used

400
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,915
For anything
other than walking.

401
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,885
Plus, how about those balls
dragging all over the ground?

402
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,053
Barney.

403
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,189
No, the tennis balls
on the bottom of the walker.

404
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,024
Oh.

405
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:44,195
Plus, his testicles were
swinging like a broken yo-yo.

406
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,364
Still, when you
think about it:

407
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,932
Married for 60 years

408
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,767
And they still want to
jump each other's bones.

409
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:54,038
I mean... It's
kind of sweet.

410
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,041
In 60 years,
that'll be us, right?

411
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,911
Yeah, it will.

412
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,116
So, what do you think, hmm?

413
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,918
On the count of three?

414
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,919
Hmm, okay.

415
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,420
Okay.

416
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,590
Both:
One, two, three.

417
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,659
Mandy patinkin.

418
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,629
Oh, wow.
Look at you.

419
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,064
Thank you for
making it...

420
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,033
We got lucky.

421
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:25,970
The farhampton liquor store
is actually pretty high-end.

422
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,539
Oh. And their security is a total joke.

423
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,710
Thanks.

424
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,115
And thanks for not telling robin
the list was mine.

425
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,050
But I don't get it.

426
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,451
You're so against me moving.

427
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,053
Why'd you help me out?

428
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:46,791
For a guy who loves new york
this much,

429
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:51,762
To leave it,
you must really need to go, huh?

430
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,999
Yeah, I really do.

431
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:59,437
Okay, but there's still
one item left on this list.

432
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,905
Time to check it off.

433
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,140
Yeah, I should
probably wait

434
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,341
For marshall.

435
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,377
Well, we both know
he may not get here in time.

436
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,081
Be honest.

437
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,150
Have you been avoiding barney?

438
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,753
Maybe a little.

439
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,190
This is the biggest weekend
of his life,

440
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,058
And you're his best bro.

441
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,095
No matter how awkward you feel,

442
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:28,799
I- if you're not there for him,
you will always regret it.

443
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,604
Okay.

444
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,439
Hey, ted.
Yeah.

445
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,678
You wrote down all these things
to say good-bye to,

446
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,881
But so many of them
are good things.

447
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,150
Why not just...

448
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,252
Say good-bye
to the bad things?

449
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,857
<i>Say good-bye to all the times
you felt lost.</i>

450
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,526
<i>To all the times</i>

451
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,629
<i>It was a no instead of a yes.</i>

452
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,534
To all the scrapes and bruises,

453
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,369
<i>To all the heartache.</i>

454
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,539
<i>Say good-bye to everything
you really want</i>

455
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,375
<i>To do for the last time,</i>

456
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,979
But don't go have
one last scotch with barney.

457
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:19,016
Have the first scotch
toasting barney's new life

458
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,051
Because that's
a good thing,

459
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,320
And the good things

460
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,089
Will always be here
waiting for you.

461
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,226
What?

462
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,628
Turn the page.

463
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,734
"get one last life lecture
from lily."

464
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,703
Well, you're dreaming

465
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,671
If you think
that's the last one of those.

466
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,088
Ah.

467
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,090
Been waiting for the
perfect time for this,

468
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,691
And, my friend,
that time is...

469
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,760
I saw you and robin
at the carousel.

470
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:10,197
