00:00:01,946 --> 00:00:05,795
<i>Kids, the summer of 2012</i>
<i>was the Summer of Love.</i>

2
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:07,677
<i>Barney and Quinn,</i>

3
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:09,861
<i>me and Victoria,</i>

4
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:12,146
<i>Robin and Nick,</i>

5
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:15,433
<i>Lily, Marshall and Marvin.</i>

6
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:17,452
<i>Everyone was happy as can be.</i>

7
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:21,789
<i>Which means there are</i>
<i>absolutely no good stories.</i>

8
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,791
<i>Let's skip ahead...</i>

9
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:26,544
<i>...to October 2012,</i>

10
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:28,279
<i>the official kick-off</i>

11
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:29,464
<i>of what came to be known as</i>

12
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:31,466
<i>the Autumn of Breakups.</i>

13
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:34,102
<i>It all started when Barney</i>
<i>got a little friendly advice</i>

14
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:35,403
<i>from a coworker.</i>

15
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,622
Get a prenup,
or I'll neuter you

16
00:00:37,624 --> 00:00:39,390
before she ever
has a chance!

17
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:42,226
First of all,
if you have an onion bagel,

18
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,512
you don't need
scallion cream cheese.

19
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:48,983
Secondly, Quinn
is a great girl.

20
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:50,234
I trust her.

21
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:51,969
Oh, Darlene was
a great girl.

22
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,137
I trusted her.

23
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:55,173
And then she took everything!

24
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,742
My house, my car...

25
00:00:57,744 --> 00:00:59,077
my dog Tugboat.

26
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,979
I even lost out
with the kids.

27
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,498
Full custody!

28
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,667
I got full custody
of those kids!

29
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:08,319
Your kids are horrible.

30
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,704
The worst.

31
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:12,490
Barney, I watched as Darlene cut
everything good out of my life

32
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:15,760
like a deranged surgeon
hacking out organs,

33
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:17,828
and that's not a metaphor.

34
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,847
She got one of my kidneys.

35
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:23,968
That's her ringtone.

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,305
I have nothing left
to give you, Darlene!

37

39
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:45,072
You won't believe
what Barney did today.

40
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,673
You won't believe
what Quinn did today.

41
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:49,959
Hey, you ready for lunch?

42
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,177
Hey, there she is.

43
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,963
The future
Mrs. Barney Stinson.

44
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:55,898
You better enjoy signing
your name "Quinn Garvey"

45
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,100
while you still can, right?

46
00:01:58,102 --> 00:01:59,852
Like, I don't know...

47
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:03,139
here, here, here,
initial here...

48
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:04,273
What is this?

49
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:06,976
Oh, this is our prenup.

50
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:09,094
Black or blue?
Totally up to you.

51
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,230
Um, can I read it first?

52
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,865
Can you believe that?

53
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,600
He wants me to sign a prenup!

54
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,951
Can you believe that?

55
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:18,788
She wants to read it first!

56
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,822
Just go ahead and sign.

57
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:21,407
It's all pretty standard.

58
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,243
"In the event of divorce,

59
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:27,079
"Mr. Stinson is granted
weekly visitation rights

60
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,315
to Ann, Sarah and Molly."

61
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,250
You named our future kids?

62
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,586
That's actually pretty sweet.

63
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:37,189
Those are Mr. Stinson's names
for your lady parts.

64
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,258
It's important for the girls

65
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,627
to maintain a relationship
with their daddy.

66
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,281
You named her lady parts?

67
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,017
Everyone does that.

68
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,735
So... Lily?

69
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,737
Snap, Crackle, Pop.

70
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,775
Solid.
Wait.

71
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,277
Is this prenup
in any way legit?

72
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,162
I mean, so far,
it sounds a lot like

73
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,698
that bar napkin document you
make one-night stands sign,

74
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,999
promising not to get clingy.

75
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,951
The Pre-Shtup, patent pending.

76
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:08,354
God, I come up with
a lot of good stuff!

77
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,822
Anyway, I realize

78
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:12,424
these aren't just terms
for divorce, so I ask...

79
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,845
Are these rules for how I have
to behave in our marriage?

80
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,463
Rules?

81
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,832
Suggestions.

82
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,134
Rich people and celebrities
put stuff like this

83
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,168
in their prenups all the time.

84
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,971
And those are
the marriages that last.

85
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:31,177
I have to pay $2,000
every time I gain a pound?

86
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,696
Not every time.

87
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:35,865
Just if it shows up
at the weekly weigh-in.

88
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,367
See, you can't do that.

89
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:41,654
"Miss Garvey must invent 12 new
sexual positions per year,

90
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,188
"at least ten of which

91
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,875
involve her doing all
or most of the work."

92
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:48,160
You definitely can't do that.
Hm-mm.

93
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,913
"Miss Garvey's breasts must be
enhanced every five years

94
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:55,167
or 50,000 honka-honkas,
whichever comes first."

95
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,253
That's actually not bad.
I'll allow it.

96
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,355
That's repulsive.

97
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:01,223
And, sidebar:
why do men think

98
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,092
women like to be
honka-honka'd?

99
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,228
What woman wants her breasts
squeezed like a seal horn?

100
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,731
Um... totally.

101
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,934
Lily like-a-like-a
the honka-honka.

102
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:16,822
"All hair below the neck
must be removed weekly."

103
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:19,491
Hey, you're gonna be thanking me
for that hair loss

104
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,560
during the weigh-in.

105
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,913
"Miss Garvey's parents
may stay at our place

106
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,614
as long as they like."

107
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:28,117
Well, at least that one's nice.

108
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,339
"Provided they
each arrive in an urn."

109
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,575
"Wives two through eight will
make a weekly chore wheel."

110
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,928
I'm sorry, I borrowed
a few sections

111
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,547
from a prenup I did
for a Saudi Arabian sultan.

112
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,515
I'll cross out
the extra wives stuff.

113
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,767
Unless...

114
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,969
Cross it out.

115
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,971
My God! What the hell
does Barney think

116
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,089
marriage is going
to be like, anyway?

117
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,859
Just a healthy,
modern-day marriage,

118
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,845
based on mutual respect
between two equals.

119
00:04:56,847 --> 00:05:00,566
Ready for your wake-up
lap dance, Master?

120
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:01,767
Aren't you forgetting something?

121
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,403
Oh, my God, it's 9:00 a.m.

122
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:08,741
Legally mandated morning
pillow fight time!

123
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,762
Best husband ever.

124
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:15,848
Best husband ever.

125
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,000
Best husband ever. Aw.

126
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,585
Best husband e...

127
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,720
Sorry, sorry, we crossed
out the wives

128
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,640
two through eight stuff. Unless...
Nope.

129
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:27,559
Okay.
Don't worry. I crossed it out.

130
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,461
I didn't really cross it out.

131
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,562
I can hear you.

132
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,315
I'll cross it out.

133
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,517
I didn't really cross it out.

134
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,353
Hey, hey...

135
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,438
Hey, guys, what's up?

136
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,973
Oh, Quinn's pissed because
Barney wants her

137
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,658
to sign a crazy prenup.

138
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,360
But is it really crazy?

139
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:46,178
Yes. Well, I'm new to this
but guessing yes.

140
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,280
Okay, look.

141
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,665
Did I go...

142
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,834
a speck of sand,
a fairy eyelash,

143
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:54,319
a unicorn whisper
too far?

144
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,588
Perhaps.

145
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,841
But can you tell me
there's nothing

146
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:01,660
in any of your relationships
you'd want to change?

147
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,296
No behavior you'd
want to outlaw?

148
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,265
No terms you'd
want to renegotiate?

149
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:09,668
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm crazy.

150
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,853
You're crazy.

151
00:06:10,855 --> 00:06:12,771
<i>But a funny thing</i>

152
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,790
<i>happened that night.</i>

153
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,861
Look, I'm not saying
he's right, but

154
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:20,729
Barney does have
a little bit of a point.

155
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,298
But on this one, he may have
a point. I mean, look...

156
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,818
the idea of renegotiating
the terms of the relationship,

157
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,736
that's valid.

158
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:29,571
No.

159
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:30,990
There isn't anything
about you

160
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:33,042
that I'd want to change.

161
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:36,462
Well, okay,
maybe a couple of things.

162
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:37,696
Like what?

163
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,548
<i>And just like that...</i>

164
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,868
<i>one of these four couples</i>
<i>would break up</i>

165
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,388
<i>the very next day.</i>

166
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,557
<i>Okay, it wasn't Lily</i>
<i>and Marshall.</i>

167
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,143
<i>One of these three couples</i>
<i>would break up</i>

168
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,762
<i>the very next day.</i>

169
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:00,767
What happened?
So last night

170
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,001
Nick was all like,
"Barney has a point

171
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:05,504
"about renegotiating the terms
of the blah, blah, blah,

172
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,838
blah, blah, blah."
Yeah, and Marshall

173
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,808
was all like, "Uh, I want
to blah, of the blah,

174
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,727
uh, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah."

175
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,329
If I shut my eyes
it's like they're here.

176
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:15,731
They're just using
Barney's prenup

177
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:18,016
as a way to complain about us.

178
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:20,268
I'm just saying, you've
forbidden certain things

179
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,320
that I might like to revisit.

180
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:25,073
Marshall, you're not going
on a Sasquatch hunt

181
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,659
in Oregon
with a bunch of loonies.

182
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,027
Loonies?

183
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,564
Those brave, bearded men and
women are crypto-zoologists,

184
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:35,667
and they deserve the respect
that title commands.

185
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:39,471
But that's not what
I was thinking of.

186
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,790
You're too precious
with the baby.

187
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,375
<i>Okay,</i>

188
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:45,343
when we first came home
with Marvin,

189
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,579
there was a bad moment.

190
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,631
Welcome home, buddy.

191
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:55,904
<i>Was it really</i> <i>that high?</i>

192
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,440
I don't know. I was hormonal.

193
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:01,810
And suddenly, this primal,
protective mother voice

194
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,111
came out of me.

195
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:05,530
Actually, it was two voices.

196
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:09,534
I seriously think one
was coming from my vagina.

197
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,570
Never do that again!

198
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:14,772
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is the big deal?

199
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,242
My brothers and my dad
used to roughhouse with me

200
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:18,693
all the time.

201
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:20,629
Welcome home,
Marshall.

202
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:24,666
Hi. Boys...

203
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:27,586
go long.

204
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:31,640
Stop!
Not in the house.

205
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:33,191
That's how lamps break.

206
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:36,328
Now go pass
that baby around outside.

207
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:40,515
Oh, fumble!

208
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:42,967
And I turned out
perfectly fine.

209
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,936
Marshall, this morning
you thought a ghost

210
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:46,521
made your toast.

211
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,107
I didn't put
the bread in.

212
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:50,859
You didn't put the bread in.

213
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:53,695
You know what?
I will play with my son

214
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,980
however I see fit.
And you know what else?

215
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:59,484
You can honka-honka
yourself tonight.

216
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:01,319
<i>Barney's prenup</i>

217
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,655
ruined my night, too.

218
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:05,874
Okay, uh, what behavior

219
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,692
of mine don't you like?

220
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,011
I'm talking about the TV thing.

221
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,180
Okay, the TV thing
is an argument

222
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:14,783
from, like,
three weeks ago.

223
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,184
Mmm.

224
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,806
Uh...

225
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:24,175
Oh, I'm sorry.

226
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:26,027
Didn't realize it
takes 42 inches

227
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,195
to keep you satisfied.

228
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:28,513
<i>The TV happened</i>

229
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:30,448
to be on.
I happened to glance at it.

230
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,567
Does that make me so weird?
No.

231
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:36,020
Not at all.
Thank you.

232
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:39,524
I may be a little weird.

233
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:42,210
Mmm.

234
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:45,130
Oh, yeah.

235
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:46,364
I get...

236
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,884
turned on
watching myself

237
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:51,970
do the news during sex.

238
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:54,606
Yeah, that's a little weird.

239
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,808
Look, seeing myself
on TV makes me feel

240
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,393
confident and sexy.

241
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:00,929
And that is nothing to be
ashamed of, right, sisters?

242
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:04,933
Never speak of this.
Ever.

243
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:07,752
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.

244
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:10,355
There's more.

245
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,577
<i>Wait.</i>

246
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,996
So when you're doing the news
live at 7:00,

247
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,864
you wink to future you

248
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:22,217
watching the rebroadcast
at 11:00?

249
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:25,787
Maybe.

250
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,589
Never speak of this.

251
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:28,790
Ever!

252
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,742
You won't believe

253
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,360
what Ted did last night.

254
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:34,713
You said you were
happy to help him out.

255
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:36,681
Well, now
I'm changing my mind.

256
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:38,099
Sorry to interrupt, roomie,
but I am trying

257
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,768
to make sausage.
Where do you keep

258
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,120
your pig intestines?

259
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:44,272
What's your ex-fiancé
doing at Ted's?

260
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:47,142
Klaus came to me
a few weeks ago.

261
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:48,627
Since we broke up,

262
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,612
he lost his job,
he got evicted.

263
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:52,430
He's miserable.

264
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:53,982
I'm so sorry.

265
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:56,067
If I could just take
a quick whore's bath

266
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,770
in your kitchen sink,
then I will skedaddle.

267
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:00,789
Oh, Klaus, I wish that
there was something

268
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,207
I could do to help.

269
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,375
There is,

270
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:06,077
little lady.
I've got a guest room.

271
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,630
You'll stay here
till you're back on your feet.

272
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:09,998
Are you sure?

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,383
This is your apartment.

274
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:13,535
Shh.

275
00:11:13,537 --> 00:11:14,803
Think of this as <i>our</i> apartment.

276
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:16,004
<i>Oh...</i>

277
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,289
Hero Ted.

278
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,657
He loves that move.

279
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,726
Yeah, for about five minutes,
then he gets hero's remorse.

280
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:23,812
<i>Danke schon,</i> roomie.

281
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,230
I will go get my things.

282
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,632
<i>Das</i> is super-duper-duper.

283
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:29,184
My ferrets will be so happy.

284
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,987
They have been living
in an airport locker for weeks.

285
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:33,805
Here comes papa,
children.

286
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,273
<i>I'll admit,</i>

287
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:37,742
there have been a
few awkward moments.

288
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:40,445
You are going to love this.

289
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:42,163
This is the popular
German situational-comedy,

290
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,331
<i>Strange Compatriots.</i>

291
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,317
Here we come.

292
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:49,704
Ooh. Here's the thing
about this show, okay?

293
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:52,123
One of them is very neat

294
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,844
<i>und</i> the other one
is very, very neat.

295
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:59,330
Oh, Fritz,
<i>kommen sie hier.</i>

296
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,549
Ah, Fritz...

297
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:04,001
It's time to give Klaus
"das boot."

298
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,506
Klaus?

299
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,959
Wait, can-can you hear us
through the wall?

300
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,494
Yes, I can hear you.

301
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:15,196
I hear everything.

302
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:17,048
That's it.

303
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,200
Klaus, get in here!

304
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:22,186
For God's sake.

305
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,322
I want you out
of my apartment.

306
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:28,743
You, those ferrets
and all five newborns.

307
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,078
Six and counting.

308
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,546
Mama is still going.

309
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:34,332
It is like a clown car.

310
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,634
Suddenly, it wasn't
<i>our</i> apartment anymore.

311
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,503
I had no say
in the matter.

312
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:40,422
These guys are unbelievable.

313
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:42,540
You know what,
I am gonna go home

314
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:46,344
and watch the news
all by myself.

315
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:47,562
Wait.

316
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,214
I have an idea.

317
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:52,484
You know what?

318
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:54,936
I'm on board
with the whole prenup thing.

319
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:56,087
That's great.

320
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,822
It's here to protect you,
too, sweetie...

321
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:01,242
from becoming unappealing to me.

322
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,862
Actually, I made my own prenup

323
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:05,580
with a little help.

324
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,031
Ladies?

325
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,738
Go ahead and sign.

326
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,006
It's all pretty standard.

327
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:18,877
This might not be the
best time to ask...

328
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,929
I'm sort of getting
back in the game.

329
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,580
The redhead with the baby,

330
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:25,233
what's her situation?

331
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:32,361
"In the event of divorce,
Miss Garvey shall get

332
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,478
full custody
of Mr. Stinson's suits"?

333
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,063
Why?

334
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:38,798
What would you do with them?

335
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,269
Nothing. I'd just sit around
and watch them go out of style.

336
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,571
That is just sick.

337
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,939
Keep reading.

338
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:48,224
"Mr. Stinson
is allowed to attend

339
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,727
any function

340
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,112
Well, at least that's nice.

341
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:56,750
"Provided he arrives in an urn."

342
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:01,154
Gentlemen, just in time.

343
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:02,589
What are you bitches doing here?

344
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,374
Lily.
Oh, he's napping.

345
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,075
It's the only time
I get to go blue.

346
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:08,945
Barney texted us that you
guys were ganging up on him.

347
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,730
So we're just here to ensure

348
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:13,300
he doesn't sign anything
he'll regret.

349
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:14,851
I'm sorry,
I don't think anyone here

350
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,252
other than me is a lawyer.

351
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:20,190
A well-paid,
successful lawyer.

352
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,976
I-I'm a lawyer.

353
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,945
Actually, we worked together
for years.

354
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,613
Back off, stretch,
I saw her first.

355
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,148
Hang on a second.

356
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,784
"A half million dollar fine

357
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,321
"any time Mr. Stinson can't
'rise to the occasion,'

358
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:37,857
cue sad slide whistle sounds"?

359
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,612
Hey, what's this
about a shock collar?

360
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,130
Ah, yes, we'll explain.

361
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,333
Miss Garvey has
many attractive friends

362
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,018
who will come to visit.

363
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,641
May I offer you

364
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:51,777
goat cheese puff
pastries I made, mistress?

365
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,980
As long as you can
do it quietly.

366
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:03,605
<i>Wait, I'm confused.</i>

367
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:06,575
If it's not around my neck,
then where's the shock collar?

368
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:10,045
Oh, God.

369
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:12,864
Oh, God.

370
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,633
It's more
of a shock ring, really.

371
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:16,201
Her idea.

372
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:19,221
Little missy
is packing a brain, too.

373
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,656
Okay, you know what?

374
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,841
Since we're all pitching in,

375
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:24,343
may I suggest a provision?

376
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,727
In the event

377
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:29,147
that you have a son,
Mr. Stinson is free

378
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:31,567
to play with his child
however he sees fit.

379
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:33,602
How about forbidding
your future husband

380
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:36,738
from spiking his child
into his crib?

381
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,991
How about a clause protecting
you from having to engage

382
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:41,910
in a three-way with her
and whatever's on basic cable?

383
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:45,447
Oh, yeah?
How about forbidding...

384
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,449
I got nothing.

385
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,202
How about a provision barring
any nudist German ex-fiancés

386
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:52,454
from slapping his strudel up
and down your sofa?

387
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:54,206
How about pretending
to be a hero,

388
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,759
but then caving the moment
a ferret bite breaks the skin?

389
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,544
The skin of my eyelid.

390
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:00,912
That's how they kiss.

391
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:01,964
Are you serious?

392
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,271
Enough! Enough!

393
00:16:09,273 --> 00:16:10,856
You all have someone
who loves you,

394
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:12,724
and you're screwing it up,
and over what?

395
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,776
Who has the most power?

396
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,261
That's not love.

397
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:18,096
Love is trusting
someone enough

398
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,365
to tell them
what's really bothering you.

399
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:21,599
So that's what we're gonna do.

400
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:22,951
You, start.

401
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,407
When you got scared
about Marvin,

402
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,043
it felt like
you were saying that

403
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:33,745
I'm not as good a parent as you.

404
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,214
You're an amazing mom,

405
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:39,751
and I want to live up to that.

406
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:43,922
Well, I probably have
trust issues

407
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:46,124
because my dad
wasn't there for me.

408
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:50,012
But I know that you'll always
be there to catch Marvin.

409
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,931
You, next.

410
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,703
Having Klaus back in our lives

411
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:01,590
made me scared we're never
gonna escape the past.

412
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:03,692
I only wanted to help Klaus

413
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:07,746
because I feel guilty
about how happy I am with you.

414
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:10,015
Next.

415
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:13,168
I find you so sexy,

416
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,356
it just hurt that you don't
feel the same about me.

417
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:22,711
I get turned on watching myself
do the news during sex.

418
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:24,179
Oh.

419
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,049
Well, that's cool.

420
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:32,854
Look at that,
no legal documents needed.

421
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:34,773
Just honesty and vulnerability.

422
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,007
That's love.

423
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,110
You see, I once loved someone,

424
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:40,195
only I didn't say it enough.

425
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:42,731
Now I wish I could
say it every day.

426
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,015
Hell,

427
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:45,400
I don't care if it's crazy,

428
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:47,452
I-I'm doing it.

429
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,687
Hello, Darlene?

430
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:50,822
Put Tugboat on the line.

431
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:52,991
Hey, buddy.

432
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:55,544
Hey, it's the man.

433
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:57,996
<i>And for a moment,</i>

434
00:17:57,998 --> 00:18:00,465
<i>all felt right with the world.</i>

435
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,866
<i>But that very night,</i>

436
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:04,836
<i>the Autumn of Breakups</i>
<i>would claim its first victims.</i>

437
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:07,422
...wish you a very safe
and pleasant evening.

438
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:09,224
Good night.

439
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,560
Good night.

440
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:16,881
Good night.

441
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:18,600
Good night.

442
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:20,552
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

443
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:21,553
And you too, my babies.

444
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:23,488
Oh, <i>danke</i> for the sweet
eye kisses.

445
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,823
Ow.

446
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:26,491
After you, sir.

447
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:27,859
Ladies first.

448
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:28,994
I insist.

449
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:31,663
I insist.

450
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,832
I'm not throwing mine out first.
I'm not throwing mine out first.

451
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,951
You've slept
with half the women in New York.

452
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:37,369
I'm the one who needs a prenup.

453
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:39,538
You duped me out of
thousands of dollars.

454
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,905
I'm the one who needs a prenup.

455
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:42,707
I just thought
of some more stuff to add.

456
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:43,875
I'm not half finished.

457
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,185
Let's dive in.

458
00:18:57,557 --> 00:19:00,475
It should be simpler than this,
shouldn't it?

459
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:02,194
Yeah.

460
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:05,096
Maybe it should be.

461
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:07,833
Barney, do you trust me?

462
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:13,955
No.

463
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,858
Do you trust me?

464
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,295
No.

465
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:25,250
If we really need something
this complicated

466
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:27,219
to get married...

467
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,974
Yeah.

468
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:38,263
* I was anxious to be found *

469
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:42,350
* You can always go home *

470
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:45,937
* To the safety of your cloud. *

471
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:48,707
I'm sorry, buddy.

472
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,141
Hey, there's always

473
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,976
wives two through eight.

474
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:54,279
They sounded pretty hot
in your fantasy.

475
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:55,864
All but wife seven.

476
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,916
She was just there
'cause her dad was rich.

477
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:02,170
Actually, I'm okay.

478
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:04,822
I found out I'll never trust
someone enough to get married,

479
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,575
and that's fine.

480
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:11,129
My single life is,
and always will be,

481
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:14,216
legen... wait for it...

482
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:17,319
...dary!

483
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:20,689
My wedding
is gonna be legendary.

484
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:22,891
So, prenup?

485
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:25,060
Not this time.

486
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:27,746
Oh, hey you.
Ready for lunch?

487
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:28,947
Totally.

488
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:31,116
Mmm.

489
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:34,152
Thanks.

490
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:36,121
See, Tugboat?

491
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,240
That's love.

492
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,796
Yeah.

493
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:49,270
Okay, you see, Ludwig has
started to polish the doorknobs,

494
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,805
but Wilhelm has
already completed this chore.

495
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:56,642
Yeah.

496
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:59,311
Ahh...

497
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,881
You know,

498
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:03,148
it's big comedy,

499
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,120
but you also really care
about these characters.

500
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,836
Wilhelm!
