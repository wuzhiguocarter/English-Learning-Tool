00:00:01,917 --> 00:00:04,248
<i>Kids, sometimes when</i>
<i>you're about to give up</i>

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,763
<i>on your love life forever</i>
<i>for the 17th time,</i>

3
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:09,156
<i>destiny intervenes.</i>

4
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:12,740
<i>Instead of rushing in,</i>
<i>I took my time</i>

5
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:14,458
<i>to think up the perfect</i>
<i>opening line.</i>

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,912
Wait, no, damn it,
come back! You're really...

7
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:19,998
You're pretty!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,249
And before I could call
out after her,

9
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:22,617
in any kind of embarrassing way

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,836
that a bunch of teenagers made
fun of for the next five stops

11
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,804
while I stared straight ahead
and pretended not to hear them,

12
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:28,056
she was gone.

13
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:31,225
But here's the thing
about Ted Mosby:

14
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,477
he doesn't give up.

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,128
Stalker Ted alert.

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,563
Repeat, Stalker
Ted alert.

17
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:37,649
Already has a yellow
legal pad going.

18
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:39,767
Repeat, already has
a yellow legal pad going.

19
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:41,235
I'm not stalking.

20
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:42,987
I just jotted down
a few details

21
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,155
to help me find her.

22
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:45,490
Uh, like the fact

23
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,358
that her smile was cute,

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,493
but a bit crooked,

25
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:50,311
which can be a sign
of teeth grinding.

26
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:51,996
So I called up
the city's

27
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:53,247
top five TMJ specialists,

28
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:55,667
and here's where it
gets interesting.

29
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:57,168
Not interesting,
Ted, creepy.

30
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,169
Let her go.

31
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,320
No, this is destiny.

32
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:01,673
No, Ted,
this is forcing it.

33
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:05,009
When Lily and I met,
I mean, that was destiny.

34
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:06,827
<i>She could've knocked</i>
<i>on any door</i>

35
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:08,262
<i>to find someone</i>
<i>to fix her stereo,</i>

36
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:09,681
<i>but she knocked on mine.</i>

37
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:14,936
Now hand over
the pad.

38
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,140
Ted...

39
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,509
And the backup pad.

40
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,611
<i>They were right.</i>

41
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,446
<i>You can't force destiny.</i>

42
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:27,014
<i>If it's gonna happen,</i>
<i>it's gonna happen.</i>

43
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:30,234
<i>And funny story, kids...</i>

44
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:31,869
Oh, my God.

45
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:33,154
It's you.

46
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:35,039
<i>...it happened.</i>

00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,111
Subway Girl's
name is Jeanette,

50
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,347
and she does grind her teeth.

51
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,682
I assume that started
the moment she met you?

52
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:58,985
Uh, well,
the fact is

53
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,654
she wanted to find me.

54
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:02,872
The first
thing I did

55
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,324
was list out all the details

56
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:05,625
I remembered about you.

57
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,627
Is... is that
a yellow legal pad?

58
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:08,694
Yeah.

59
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,029
I've even got a backup.

60
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,331
Oh, my God.

61
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,032
You had a tweed blazer

62
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,467
and chalk all over your hands,

63
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,052
so I figured you were
either a professor

64
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,754
or a British gymnast.

65
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:20,723
I'm bloody
good on the pommel 'orse.

66
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,310
Regrettin' this accent.

67
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,179
Can't seem to stop.

68
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,730
So then I asked the lady
at the student center

69
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,182
where I could find
the youngest,

70
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,850
cutest professor on staff.

71
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:31,934
And...?

72
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,403
She sent me to a physics class.

73
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:35,238
Professor Leyborne?

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,523
I wonder if she'd think
Dr. Goodhair was so cute

75
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,076
if she knew he hasn't been
published in over a year?

76
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,327
Then she sent me here,

77
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,612
but the security guard
wouldn't let me in

78
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:43,946
without an ID.

79
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,198
I was about to give up

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,033
when the fire alarm
just sent you out.

81
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:48,701
It was like...

82
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:49,819
Destiny.

83
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,287
Right? Right?

84
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,588
It's a meet-cute.

85
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,673
It's a stalk-crazy.

86
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:54,691
Look...

87
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:55,942
there's a fine line

88
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:58,378
between love and insanity.

89
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,278
It's...

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,547
the Dobler-Dahmer theory.

91
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,932
Oh, no...

92
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,567
- Damn, I always forget the little one.
- All right.

93
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,719
If both people are
into each other,

94
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,805
a big romantic gesture works.

95
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,474
Like Lloyd Dobler holding
up the boom box

96
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:13,643
outside Diane Court's window
in <i>Say Anything.</i>

97
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:14,977
But if
one person

98
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:16,112
isn't into the other,

99
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,648
the same gesture comes off
serial-killer crazy,

100
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,400
or Dahmer.

101
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:21,784
Now, Marshall, the story of

102
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,287
how you asked out Lily
is super sweet.

103
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,273
♪ Lily, how you thrill me

104
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,125
♪ But it may just even kill me

105
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,127

106
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:33,045
♪ To this question

107
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,885
♪ Will you go out with me?

108
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,804
I will-y.

109
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,222
Dobler.

110
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,991
But if Lily wasn't into you?

111
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:47,143
♪ Lily, how you thrill me

112
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,312
♪ But it might
just even kill me ♪

113
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:51,481

♪ Will you go out with me?

116
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,324
Dahmer.

117
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,443
Whether a gesture's
charming or alarming

118
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:05,144
depends on how it's received.

119
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:08,147
And I was charmed
by Jeanette finding me,

120
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:10,082
hence... she's a Dobler.

121
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,151
Don't you think
it's a little convenient

122
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,488
how that fire alarm happened
to randomly go off?

123
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,706
What are you saying?

124
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,508
Ted, does she have
enormous cans?

125
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,376
No.
Then what we're saying is

126
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:21,994
she's a crazy stalker bitch
who pulled that fire alarm

127
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,429
and you should
run screaming.

128
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,380
You know what?

129
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:25,331
I-I don't think

130
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,799
that we should be so cavalier

131
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,217
with the word "stalker."

132
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,303
Why does that word
bother you so much?

133
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,554
Doesn't bother me.

134
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:34,307
Wait... do you
have a stalker?

135
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,893
I don't want to talk
about this.

136
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:37,944
What do you mean?

137
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,278
As your fiancé,
if you have

138
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,314
some psycho stalker out
there, I should know.

139
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:42,615
It was me.

140
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,983
I was a stalker.

141
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,735
It was back
in Canada.

142
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,236
I liked a guy

143
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:50,022
and he didn't
like me, and...

144
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,524
well, I got
a little obsessed.

145
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,293
I'd fill up my journals
all about him,

146
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,462
and eventually
there may have been

147
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,532
a teensy-weensy
50-meter restraining order.

148
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,700
50 meters?

149
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:02,718
That's like...

150
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
four years.

151
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,472
Wow.

152
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,558
You must have been
a total nutbag.

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,542
I wasn't.

154
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:10,543
Ted is right,

155
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:11,677
there is
a fine line.

156
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,596
Anyone can cross it
and get obsessed.

157
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,731
Yeah, if you're
a total nutbag.

158
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,352
Now, uh...
who's the guy?

159
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:20,770
I'm not telling you
until you admit

160
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:22,188
that this can happen
to anybody.

161
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,222
I'm not admitting that.

162
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:24,440
Fine. Forget it.
I'm not telling you.

163
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:25,741
Fine. Forgotten.

164
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>"You are so beautiful.</i>

165
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:38,904
<i>"Why can't you see me?</i>

166
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,457
<i>"Someday, I'll make you see me</i>

167
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,376
<i>"and we'll be together.</i>

168
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:44,794
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>

169
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,797
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>
<i>P.S. I love you.</i>

170
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,549
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>

00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:51,300
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>
<i>P.S. I love you.</i>

172
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:54,420
<i>P.S. I love you, you, you."</i>

173
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,105
<i>This is "ridikilus."</i>

174
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,224
<i>Who cares who she</i>
<i>was obsessed with?</i>

175
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:01,594
<i>What, am I gonna go to Canada</i>
<i>and track this guy down?</i>

176
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,030
<i>Thankfully,</i>

177
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,648
<i>unlike Uncle Barney,</i>
<i>I wasn't the kind of guy</i>

178
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,433
<i>to fixate on</i>
<i>one little detail.</i>

179
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,201
That fire alarm--
did you pull it?

180
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,536
Ugh...

181
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,871
This is embarrassing.

182
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:14,707
I wasn't gonna tell you this,
but...

183
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,075
<i>I'd come so far,</i>

184
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:18,711
<i>only to be sent packing</i>
<i>by that security guard,</i>

185
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,463
<i>and... well...</i>

186
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,884
I'm sorry.

187
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,302
I just couldn't stand the idea

188
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,786
of not meeting you.

189
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,755
<i>Could not</i>

190
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,475
stand the idea

191
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:34,143
of not meeting me.

192
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,511
Was it a little

193
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:37,980
over the top to pull
that fire alarm? Perhaps.

194
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,815
But it charmed me.

195
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,901
Hence... Dobler.

196
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,353
Aha! You see?

197
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:46,022
People don't put fire alarms

198
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:48,658
out in front lobbies
for just anyone to prank pull.

199
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,109
They put smoke detectors

200
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,527
up on the ceiling.

201
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,245
Hold on.

202
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,448
I'm beginning to think
that you guys didn't come here

203
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,999
to see my new lectern.

204
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,619
Are you implying
Jeanette started a fire?

205
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:00,703
Dahmer.

206
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,305
Dobler.

207
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:03,673
She's John Cusack,

208
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:05,041
I'm Ione Skye,

209
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:07,326
and there is nothing
weird about that.

210
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,715
Gordie Bellavoh.

211
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:14,550
Thanks again for
the free donuts, eh?

212
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:17,169
So, you up here
visiting family?

213
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,355
No. I'm not Canadian.

214
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:21,307
Not even a quarter Canadian
on my father's side.

215
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:22,642
Shut up.

216
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,727
We're not talking "aboot" me--

217
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,697
<i>about</i> me. Whoa.

218
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,065
How long did you and Robin date?

219
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,117
Well, it wasn't
really dating.

220
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,285
We'd take a sixer of Labatts
behind the hydro plant

221
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,288
and she'd let me go under
her parka over turtleneck.

222
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,457
Summer love.

223
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,127
Was Robin obsessed with you?

224
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,044
No.

225
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,245
No.

226
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:44,497
Robin was way more into
this guy named...

227
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,415
Turk Grimsby.

228
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:49,001
I hear Robin
was obsessed with you?

229
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,836
No. We only went out
a few times,

230
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:51,804
barely knew each other.

231
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,139
All we talked about

232
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,724
was her relationship
with her mother,

233
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,425
the gnawing feelings
of inadequacy,

234
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:59,011
all the horrible secrets
on that side of the family.

235
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,879
But heck, you're her fiancé.

236
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,214
You know all that, right?

237
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,882
Yeah.

238
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,050
Robin was

239
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,219
way more into this other guy.

240
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:10,072
Can't seem to remember his name.

241
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,190
Though sometimes
a powdered jelly

242
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:12,891
can help get
the old noodle going.

243
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,562
Ah...

244
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,030
His name's...

245
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,665
Simon Tremblay.

246
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,033
I should have known.

247
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,067
Eh.

248
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,252
Thanks for the free donuts.

249
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:24,570
They're just donuts!

250
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,739
Okay? They're like
two for a loonie-- <i>dollar.</i>

251
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:27,923
What's happening?

252
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,743
Oh, somebody moosed down
all the jellies.

253
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,412
Have you been hanging
out with Turk Grimsby?

254
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,432
So how serious
were you and Robin?

255
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:39,268
Well, serious enough
to pop the question.

256
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,386
Wow. Really?

257
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:41,587
Yeah, sure.

258
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,189
Got down on one goalie pad,

259
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,640
I said, "Robin,

260
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:47,643
could we keep dating but I get
to stick it to other babes?"

261
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:48,978
Turned me down.

262
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,896
I'm so sorry.

263
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:51,897
Oh, that's okay.

264
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,983
I really wanted to stick it
to Louise Marsh.

265
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,203
Still, as the years pass,

266
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:59,705
and you take stock of your life,

267
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,941
part of me wishes I could've
kept sticking it to Robin, too.

268
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,212
So are you the one
that Robin stalked?

269
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:09,448
Oh, that story goes back
to the 1996 Grey Cup.

270
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,634
What in God's name is that?

271
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,185
Only Canada's Super Bowl.

272
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,220
Didn't you
ever see

273
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,671
<i>Underneath the Tunes</i>

274
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:16,889
on MuchMusic?

275
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,224
Again, I have to go with:

276
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,810
what in God's name is that?

277
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:23,462
It's only Canada's
VH1 <i>Behind the Music.</i>

278
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:25,464
There's one all about
Robin Sparkles.

279
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,601
Tells you the whole story
from "A" to zed.

280
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,274
Are you gonna
take your...?

281
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:40,418
<i>Kids, relationships</i>

<i>So unlike Uncle Barney,</i>

283
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:43,901
<i>I wasn't gonna keep</i>
<i>digging and digging...</i>

284
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:45,203
Did you start a fire?

285
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:47,188
Ugh...

286
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,190
This is embarrassing.

287
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:51,793
I wasn't gonna tell you this,
but...

288
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,183

I'm sorry.

292
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,397
I just couldn't stand the idea

293
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,399
of not meeting you.

294
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,884
<i>Could not</i>

295
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,919
stand the idea

296
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,338
of not meeting me.

297
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,539
She set a fire, Ted!

298
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,774
Dahmer.

299
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:14,925
You're just jealous 'cause Lily

300
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,093
never burned anything for you.

301
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,811
Clearly you never
tried her pot roast.

302
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:20,097
I actually brought this

303
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,348
for something totally different,

304
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,416
but it worked out, right?

305
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:23,600
Okay, anyway,

306
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:24,501
here's my thing.

307
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:26,103
Ladies and gentlemen,

308
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,138
I have in my back pocket

309
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,857
the answer to the question

310
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,459
"Who was Robin obsessed with?"

311
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:34,395
Hang on tight.

312
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:37,147
It's Robin Sparkles 4, y'all!

313
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,679
<i>With her jelly bracelets,</i>
<i>graffiti coat,</i>

314
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,380
<i>and totally rad robot, no one</i>

315

<i>in Canada like Robin Sparkles.</i>

316
00:10:57,336 --> 00:11:00,454
<i>But as we'd all learn one</i>
<i>heartbreaking Grey Cup Sunday,</i>

317
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:03,057
<i>Canada's sweetheart</i>
<i>had a dark side.</i>

318
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,808
I'll never forget that moment.

319
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,261
A little piece of Canada
died that day.

320
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:09,029
To see her
throw her life away like that...

321
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,433
...it was heartbreaking.

322
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:14,084
I am so happy right now.

323
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:16,828
I want to see her throw
her life away so badly.

324
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:17,777
Yeah.

325
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,378
We're all terrible people--
turn it up.

326
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,831
<i>Sparkles' hit records...</i>

327
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,352
...both went maple with "Mall"
<i>eventually going double maple.</i>

328
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,089
I never admitted this till now,
but before a big game,

329
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,391
<i>I'd listen to</i>
"Sand Castles in the Sand"

330
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,143
<i>and get a good cry on.</i>

331
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,415
I'm not ashamed.

332
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:41,353
<i>But after endless touring,</i>
<i>Robin started to crack.</i>

333
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,288

00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:49,661
I can't do this.

336
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:52,831

The whole stadium went silent.

378

Right then, I knew something
terrible was gonna happen.
