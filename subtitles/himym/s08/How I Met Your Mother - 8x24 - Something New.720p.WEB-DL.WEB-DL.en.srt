1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:03,869
Kids, in the spring of 2013,

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,772
We were all tying up loose ends
before the big wedding.

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,340
<i>I was right here</i>
<i>in this very room,</i>

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,942
<i>Putting the finishing touches</i>
<i>on the house.</i>

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:17,149
Oh, come on!

6
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,318
Narrator: <i>Barney and robin</i>
<i>were wrapping up rehearsal</i>

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,319
<i>For their first dance.</i>

8
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,788
That was amazing.
We can do better.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,989
Back to one, everyone!

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,159
Reload the cannons,
we'll go again right away.

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,495
(sighs)

12
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:30,896
Narrator: <i>And lily and marshall</i>
<i>were packing</i>

13
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,898
<i>For their year in Italy.</i>

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,166
(phone rings)

15
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,168
Hello.

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,037
How's my favorite
daughter-in-law?

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,038
Oh, things are

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,339
A bit crazy here.

19
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,341
We've got this big move to rome
coming up,

20
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,909
And I, I just can't shake
the feeling

21
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,178
That I'm forgetting something,
you know.

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,881
I know, I know,
I'm being crazy, right?

23
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,582
Right, judy?

24
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,583
Right,
judy?

25
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,153
You're moving to rome?!

26
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,188
(whispering):
Is that my mom?

27
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,824
Don't mention rome.

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,240
You didn't tell
your mom about rome?

29
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,241
It didn't feel right.

30
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,910
This isn't
over-the-phone news.

31
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,178
This is face-to-face news.

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,047
I was gonna tell her
when we see her at christmas.

33
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,348
You were gonna wait and tell her

34
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,951
After we had already been living
there for six months?

35
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,587
That... Was a great plan.

36
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,655
Damn it.

37
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,425
Hey, mom, it's marshall.

38
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,127
If you're moving to rome,

39
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:39,131
I at least need to see
my grandson before you go!

40
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,600
Of course, and that is why
we would love

41
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,869
For you to come visit us
for a week.

42
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,904
No.

43
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,639
The place will be all packed up.

44
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,309
Oh, oh, uh, okay, hey, mom,
better idea:

45
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,778
How about we all come visit you
for a week?

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,413
I can't go to minnesota
for a week.

47
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,615
I have a job.

48
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,118
Okay, mom, here's the plan:
Um, lily has to work,

49
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,888
So marvin and I will come visit
you for a whole week,

50
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,490
And I-I'll see if I can
get a last-minute flight.

51
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,994
You are going to take
my infant son

52
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,296
Away from me for a whole week?

53
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,333
Whoo!

54
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,668
So, what do you want
to do tonight--

55
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,937
Drink ourselves blind,
set a car on fire?

56
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,573
(gasps) ooh, watch a movie
that doesn't start

57
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,176
With a desk lamp jumping
on top of a capital "I"?

58
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,745
I'm all yours, teddy westside.

59
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,181
Actually, tonight
it's teddy westchester.

60
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,450
Got to head up to the house,
take care of some stuff.

61
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,819
Oh, yeah,
how's the restoration going?

62
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,421
Actually, done.

63
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,422
You finished the house?

64
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,258
Well, I want to see it.

65
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,026
Marshall already canceled
the cable, huh?

66
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,327
And the wi-fi.
It's like <i>little house</i>

67
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,595
<i>On the freaking prairie</i>
<i>up there.</i>

68
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,696
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,934
Well, the wedding
planning is done,

70
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,504
So tonight is all about relaxing
and celebrating

71
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,473
Everything that makes us
awesome,

72
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,307
Which is why

73
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,643
I requested our favorite table.

74
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,678
The one by the window.

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,148
Where we were sitting the night
we saw those two bums fighting.

76
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,983
Both:
Over a sandwich.

77
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,519
(both laughing)

78
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,154
We almost called the cops.
(sighs)

79
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,323
And then we realized
they weren't fighting at all.

80
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,724
They were making love.

81
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:13,492
(sighs)

82
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,127
Over a sandwich.

83
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,496
Oh, I almost forgot.

84
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,997
(gasps)

85
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,065
Ha-ha, yeah.
No way,
is that...?

86
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,334
El piramide.

87
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,037
The first cigar
we ever smoked together.

88
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,638
Aw, barney.

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,339
(chuckles)

90
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,907
Woman:
Excuse me.

91
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,075
Hi.

92
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,743
Could you not?
Thanks.

93
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,978
Uh...

94
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,179
Dude, I'm not gonna
light 'em up in here.

95
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,148
I'm just looking
at 'em.

96
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,016
Right, but even
when they're unlit,

97
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,219
The smell-- it's very...

98
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,220
Pungent.

99
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,188
Exactly--
thank you.

100
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,725
It's a very pungent smell.

101
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,994
So, could you not?

102
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,062
Thanks.

103
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,066
Okay.

104
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,501
(sighs)

105
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,739
I'm sorry, can you also
put the bag away?

106
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:05,844
It-it's just really
unappetizing to look at.

107
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,379
You're unappetizing to look at.

108
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,915
You know what?
Um, I'll put them away, okay?

109
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,083
Enjoy your night.

110
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,185
We'll try.

111
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,855
Did those two just become
our archenemies?

112
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,090
No, robin, they've
always been

113
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,057
Our archenemies.

114
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,461
They've only just
revealed themselves.

115
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,695
Hi, kristen?

116
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,864
Everyone pronounces it wrong.
(groans)

117
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,899
The "r" is
after the "I."

118
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:28,934
Kirsten.

119
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,369
And before the "I."

120
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,238
(sighs)
it's krirsten.

121
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,706
Your table's ready.

122
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,211
Wow, they're "trerrible."

123
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,212
You know what?

124
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,114
Don't even think
about them, okay?

125
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,283
Tonight is about
celebrating us.
You're right,
you're right.

126
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,052
We shouldn't let
a couple...
Man:
Nope, nope.

127
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,487
I'm a self-diagnosed
claustrophobic.

128
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,889
I have to sit
next to the window.

129
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,591
No, that's our table,
that's our table,

130
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,293
That's our table,
that's our table,
that's our table,

131
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,894
That's our table.

132
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,796
(groans)

133
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,064
You know what?

134
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,166
Screw celebrating us.
You know what we're gonna do?

135
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,169
Both:
Make those smug,
obnoxious sons of bitches pay.

136
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,604
Aw...

137
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:07,739
(both giggle)

138
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,941
Narrator:
<i>So aunt lily and I drove up</i>
<i>to westchester.</i>

139
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:10,942
(phone rings)

140
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,178
Hey, baby,

141
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,179
How's minnesota?

142
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,947
Marshall:
It is so much fun.

143
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,285
Marshall, I made you this
welcome-home ice cream sundae.

144
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,988
But I can't remember,
do you like crushed nuts?

145
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,989
Marshall:
I love

146
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,090
Crushed nuts.

147
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,558
Oh!

148
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,029
Anyway, it's,
it's great to be home.

149
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,464
How's judy doing?

150
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,598
Oh, she's great.

151
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,866
It's cute, you know,
she keeps joking

152
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,601
About how she's not
gonna let us leave.

153
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,969
I'm really not.

154
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,604
It's not a joke.

155
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,605
(laughing)

156
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,976
(all laughing)

157
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,812
Judy's going to talk him
out of going to rome.

158
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,947
I knew something was going
to screw up our plans,

159
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,349
And this is it.

160
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,818
She is going to convince him
never to leave the country.

161
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,786
I think
you're imagining things.

162
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,989
Oh, yeah? Well, check out
what's already on facebook.

163
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,624
Inconclusive.

164
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,460
Oh, really?

165
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,730
It's getting
conclusiver.

166
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:05,731
Hey, lily.

167
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,033
What?
Come on.

168
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,969
Okay, open 'em.

169
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,405
Your eyes-- sorry,
they should have been closed.

170
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,406
That one's on me.

171
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:15,407
Let's try again.

172
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,575
Wow.

173
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,978
Ted, you did this
all yourself?

174
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,981
Just like ryan gosling
in   <i>the notebook.</i>

175
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,016
I was pretty manly
till I mentioned

176
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,018
Ryan gosling
in <i>the notebook,</i> huh?

177
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,587
Even I haven't seen it, ted.

178
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,323
Just think, this is the house

179
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,091
Your kids are going
to grow up in.

180
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,927
They are going to
roast marshmallows

181
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,763
In this fireplace.

182
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,764
They're gonna
experiment

183
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,999
With recreational drugs

184
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,167
On that porch.

185
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,435
They're gonna sit
on a couch right here

186
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,170
And listen to your
boring stories about...

187
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,173
"for sale" sign?

188
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,076
Are you selling this place?

189
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,044
Yeah.

190
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,479
Why?

191
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:59,451
Because I'm moving to chicago.

192
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,026
Ow.

193
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,060
So, what are
we gonna do--

194
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,295
Put something in their food,

195
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,431
Key their car?
Ooh,

196
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,032
Do either
of those cigars explode?

197
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,202
Hold on, wile e. Coyote,
I think I got something.

198
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,539
He's checking
out the hostess.

199
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,075
Now, a guy who's happily in
a relationship sees a girl

200
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,513
Like that, he'll check her out
maybe 14, 15 times, tops.

201
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,116
16 times, tops.

202
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,920
So krirsten's more invested
in the relationship

203
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,055
Than her fella is.

204
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,090
That could spell trouble.

205
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,859
Challenge accepted.

206
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,995
Hey, do you think it's bad luck
for a bride

207
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,998
To break up two strangers
a week before her wedding?

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,336
I'd say it's very bad luck...
For krirsten.

209
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,371
(both laughing)

210
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,311
Ow, I hate this table so much!

211
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,512
Why would you move

212
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,147
To chicago?

213
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,949
Because it's the perfect town
for me.

214
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,017
I-it's like a clevelandy
new york,

215
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,619
And-- don't act like
you haven't noticed--

216
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,988
My hair excels in the wind.

217
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,122
Besides,

218
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,190
You're moving to rome.

219
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah, for a year,
a-and when we get back,

220
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,928
We need you to be here waiting
for us,

221
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,699
Hopefully living in this house
with your future bride.

222
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,968
Wha... What future bride?

223
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,969
The girl.

224
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,136
She's out there

225
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,138
Walking around new york city
right now,

226
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,608
Probably in a pair
of really cute boots

227
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,443
That she's gonna let me borrow
whenever I want

228
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,777
Because we're the same size.

229
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,379
She is out there, ted.

230
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,982
Is she, really?
Because I've looked.

231
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,016
I have looked high

232
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,318
And low for someone I can love

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,888
And adore and cook waffles for.

234
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,322
The closest I've come is
marshall.

235
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,490
He does love your waffles.

236
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,625
It's the
cinnamon.

237
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,193
I add cinnamon.

238
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,029
She's not in new york.

239
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,631
Maybe she's in chicago.
(phone rings)

240
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,400
Okay, you are being ridiculous.

241
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,036
You are going to find someone
here in new york

242
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,138
That you love
just as much as I love marshall.

243
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,506
And you,

244
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,577
If you let judy talk you out
of going to Italy, so help me,

245
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,247
I will never let you stuff
my ravioli again.

246
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,982
I'm gonna take you
off speaker.

247
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,384
Lily, you got to relax.

248
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,487
Okay, my mom is psyched
about Italy.

249
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,088
She keeps making jokes
about how she's gonna

250
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,659
Come live with us in rome
and sleep on the couch

251
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,027
And cook every meal for us

252
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,995
So we never have to go
to a restaurant

253
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,163
The whole year we're there.

254
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:25,997
It's not a joke.

255
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,032
By not saying no

256
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,100
To me right now,
you are giving me

257
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,202
Your full consent
for that to happen.

258
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,571
(laughs)

259
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,073
(laughing and mumbling)

260
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,107
(forced laugh)

261
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,676
I got to go.

262
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,744
Barney:
"I'm probably saying
some political stuff

263
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,912
Right now to sound smart."

264
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,448
"I'm probably referring
to some snooty podcast

265
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,517
To sound even smarter."

266
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,052
"I'm probably saying
something in french."

267
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,053
Aah!

268
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,054
My god...

269
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,956
Ow.

270
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,957
Okay,

271
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:52,958
You want to break them up?

272
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,259
I got a plan.

273
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,394
It's something I know has worked
in the past,

274
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,929
But it-it's, it's risky,

275
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,398
So it's, it's not too late
to call it off.

276
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,034
No way, I'm in.
Good, 'cause it's too late
to call it off.

277
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,936
Observe.

278
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,104
And that is
why the senate

279
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,606
Can't push anything through.

280
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,474
And doug mand said
the same thing in his podcast.
It's like,

281
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,810
"après moi le déluge!"

282
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,044
(laughing)

283
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,482
Ooh.

284
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,583
Oh, my gosh.

285
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,985
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

286
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,253
Yes, yes, yes.

287
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,421
Yes!

288
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,222
Man:
What?

289
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,457
Krirsten:
Yes!

290
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,293
(chuckles) even though
a ring in a champagne glass

291
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,128
Is a total cliché
and this is a cushion cut.

292
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,130
And how long have I been hinting
that I want a princess cut?

293
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,164
But yes!

294
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,799
That's a mistake.
That's not from me.

295
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,801
It's not?

296
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,138
We've only been together
seven years.

297
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,008
Now it becomes clear.
Here we go.

298
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,410
You want commitment the same way
you want my brother

299
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,979
To work for you.
I'm sorry I didn't put an
engagement ring in your drink.

300
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,316
The way you chug booze,
I'm surprised you even noticed.

301
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,518
So, when are you leaving?

302
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,153
Day after the wedding.

303
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,154
What?

304
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,323
You can't miss the day
after the wedding.

305
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,693
That's when we sit around
all hungover, drinking mimosas

306
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,862
And talking smack
about who looked fat.

307
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,930
That's my christmas.

308
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,900
Why are you in such a rush
to get out of there?

309
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,871
Oh.

310
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,306
Of course.

311
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,375
You're not leaving
because you think

312
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,611
The love of your life
isn't in new york.

313
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,680
You're leaving because
you think she is.

314
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,114
And this time next week,

315
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,051
She'll be married
to your best friend.

316
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,019
(phone rings)

317
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,554
(sighs) baby!

318
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,955
I am in the middle

319
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,959
But real quick: If you let judy
come to rome with us,

320
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,028
You are going to have
to find someone else

321
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,064
To do your laundry
and massage your feet.

322
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,966
Oh, my gosh, she's going to do
all that, won't she?

323
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,135
Lily, you have to stop
freaking out.

324
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,337
Nothing is going to screw up
the plan.

325
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,972
We're doing this.

326
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,240
I love you.

327
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,975
I love you, baby. Bye.

328
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,512
(phone rings)

329
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,914
Hello?

330
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,248
Hi. Marshall eriksen?

331
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,318
I'm calling from the new york
state judiciary committee.

332
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,887
Uh, you applied for a judgeship
a few months ago, remember?

333
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,422
Uh, of... Of course.

334
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,857
Well, I have good news.

335
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,059
We have a last-minute opening
on the bench.

336
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,028
What are you saying to me
right now?

337
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,529
I'm saying congratulations.

338
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,598
We want you to be a judge.

339
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,073
So, you want me to be a judge?
Yes.

340
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,942
And I would start a week
from Tuesday?
Yes.

341
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,111
Could I maybe start
a year from Tuesday?
No.

342
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,946
Got to be a week from Tuesday?
Yes.

343
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,414
And I'd be a real judge?
Yes.

344
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,381
With a robe?
Yes.

345
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:31,416
Gavel?
Yes.

346
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,118
Wacky southern accent?
No.

347
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,352
(bad southern accent):
Now, counselor,

348
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,754
Are you absolutely sure?

349
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,455
Yes.
And I have to be
in new york for this?

350
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,090
Yes.
I can't telecommute?

351
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,192
No.
I couldn't be the crazy
speakerphone judge?

352
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,927
No.
Could I be a hologram?

353
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,629
No.
Animatronic robot

354
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,765
Like abe lincoln
from the hall of presidents

355
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,601
That I control from afar
with a joystick?
No.

356
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,970
Do you remember the giant
jor-el head from <i>superman?</i>

357
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,071
Yes.
Well, what if I...?

358
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,773
No.
Is there any way

359
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,374
That I could do this

360
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,444
And also spend
the next year of my life

361
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,279
In Italy with my wife?
No.

362
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,281
This is such a big decision.

363
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,717
I-I'm not good at big decisions.

364
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,153
Are you sure you want
to be a judge?

365
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,057
Wow. Now that we've broken up
a seven-year relationship

366
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,926
Just 'cause they
stole our table,

367
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,761
I feel kind of...
Awesome?

368
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,164
I was going to say horny,
but yeah, awesome, too.

369
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,266
(both laughing)

370
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,467
No way.

371
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,102
Are you kidding me?
What?

372
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,069
Barney:
Whoa. Is there
going to be a fight?

373
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,404
Okay, here's the play.

374
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,339
You take the girl, and
the guy and I will watch.

375
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,975
Hello. Just the people
we want to see.

376
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,646
We got in a pretty big fight
because of you guys.

377
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,281
We had to call our
therapists after hours.

378
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,283
Not cool.

379
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,118
Anyway, it got us
to where we are now.

380
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,519
We're getting married!

381
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,788
And I'm taking
her last name.

382
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,290
You should think
about doing the same thing.

383
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,925
Well, good night.
Good night.

384
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,693
Good night.
Congratulations.

385
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,129
Yes, definitely.

386
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,164
That was us.

387
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,000
We made that happen.

388
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,002
We're pretty cool.

389
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,371
And, you know,
a week from today,

390
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,842
We are going to be legend...
Wait for it...

391
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,943
Married.

392
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,811
Legend-married.
Legend-married.

393
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,047
(both laughing)

394
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,150
Robin scherbatsky,
I love you so damn much.

395
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,786
I love you, too,
barney scherbatsky.

396
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,454
That sounds good.

397
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,989
Shh.
Think about it.

398
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,524
Ted:
<i>They're happy.</i>

399
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,359
<i>And I'm happy for them.</i>

400
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,062
I want them to have an amazing
life together. I just...

401
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,030
I just think it would
be best for everyone

402
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:31,002
Did something happen recently
between you and robin?

403
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,704
No.

404
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,205
Where's the poop, ted?

405
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,576
She called me up the other day.

406
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,411
<i>She was trying</i>
<i>to dig up this locket</i>

407
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,347
<i>She had buried behind</i>
<i>the central park carousel,</i>

408
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,216
<i>And I blew off that</i>
<i>big interview to go help her.</i>

409
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,120
And then... It started raining.

410
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,392
I'll, uh...

411
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,727
I'll see you
at the wedding.

412
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,395
Yeah.

413
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,397
Ted: <i>Even now,</i>
<i>after all these years,</i>

414
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,866
There's still just
this part of me where,

415
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,368
If there's even
the slightest chance

416
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,203
Something I do
could make robin smile,

417
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,239
I don't even think about it--
I just do it.

418
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,607
I mean, if I could make

419
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,442
That locket magically appear,
I would.

420
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,544
I would open a vein in my arm

421
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,747
If I could bleed
that locket out,

422
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,815
Just to make her happy.

423
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,086
That's just
a really sucky way to feel

424
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,355
About your best friend's
fiancée.

425
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,460
So I'm going to come
to the wedding, and, uh,

426
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,196
You know, I'll have a good time,
but after that, I...

427
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,499
What?

428
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,037
(sighs)
I know where the locket is.

429
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,438
What?

430
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,607
I know where the locket is.

431
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,642
It-it was a few years ago,

432
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,244
<i>Right before you were</i>
<i>supposed to marry stella.</i>

433
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,046
<i>I went down to the bar</i>
<i>one night</i>

434
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,881
<i>To get a drink,</i>
<i>and what should I see?</i>

435
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,982
Lily!

436
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,750
Hey, girl.

437
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,452
I got a question for you.

438
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,089
Why isn't ted marrying me?

439
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,457
Whoa...

440
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,559
I'm sorry. Oh, god.

441
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,927
I'm sorry.

442
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,397
I just... I-I should
be happy for him,

443
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,466
And yet here I am,

444
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,170
Moving off to japan just
to get away from him.

445
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,272
And-and I guess
to see those...

446
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,008
Those terra-cotta warriors
and the great wall.

447
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,743
Well, that's china.

448
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,011
What? This?

449
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,312
No, it's just a paper plate.

450
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,314
(plate shatters)

451
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,849
Uh, we should
get out of here.

452
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,150
Come on. Come on.
Oh, totally.

453
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,586
I know just where we should go.

454
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,024
Man, you're fast
when you're drunk.

455
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,094
But at least you're still
making good decisions.

456
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,962
Central park,
around midnight,

457
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,931
Digging a hole
with a spoon.

458
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,099
Solid.

459
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,134
Jackpot. (sighs)

460
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,168
What is that?

461
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,371
My something old.

462
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,977
This locket was my grandma's.

463
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,814
She kept it hidden in her butt
all through world war ii.

464
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,116
What? Where was she?

465
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,618
Winnipeg.

466
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,986
(laughing)

467
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:02,954
Oh, come on.

468
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,289
Lily, it's a joke.

469
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,291
Yeah, I was
going to wear this

470
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,493
When I married ted.

471
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,961
I guess that's not
going to happen.

472
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:13,398
So I am taking it
with me to japan.

473
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,968
Okay, lily, help me put
this locket in my butt.

474
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,736
Okay. Uh, you know what?

475
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:23,074
Why don't we put it
in this pencil box instead?

476
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:27,011
Oh, and then I will take the
pencil box with me to japan.

477
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,814
Okay. Hey, lily?

478
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:33,017
Help me put this
pencil box in my butt.

479
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,118
(laughing)

480
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,188
Wait!

481
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,824
There's one other thing
I have to do.

482
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,592
Lily, it's very important.

483
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,995
It's something
that needs to happen

484
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,364
Right now.
Yeah?

485
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,032
Then she barfed in my face.

486
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,167
It was a lovely night.

487
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,071
Wait. You put the locket
in the race car pencil box?

488
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,040
Yep. And then robin
took it to japan.

489
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,242
No, she didn't.

490
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:03,381
It's sitting on my desk
at home right now.

491
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,716
It's been with me all along.

492
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,419
Ted.
The locket is in
the pencil box.

493
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,121
This is awesome.

494
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,556
Ted.

495
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:12,957
No, I just... I just mean,

This is going to be
the best wedding gift ever.

497

00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,600

(yells in pain)

535
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,027
Hey, I don't want to draw
focus from the wedding, so...

536
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,995
Don't tell anyone
about chicago.

537
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,831
It's a major city
with a bunch of sports teams

538
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,133
And some pretty good pizza.

539
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,035
I think people know
about chicago.

540
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,805
What time do you
leave on Monday?

541
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,006
Early.

542
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,642
Gonna have to head back
to the city Sunday night.

543
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,077
How are you
going to get back?

544
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,147
Guess I'll take the train.
