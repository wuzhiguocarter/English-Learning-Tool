Uncle Barney is a bit of a dog,

<i>and even though he loved me,</i>

<i>a wingman who was</i>
<i>a bit of a dog, too.</i>

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,822
<i>And in the fall of 2012...</i>

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,458
<i>...he found one.</i>

00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,826
Respect.

Hey, guys, thanks again
for a great night last night.

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,086
I say again,

11
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,067
great night.

12
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:54,803
Ted, honey, it was
not a great night.

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,859
Ted,

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,078
Lily and I noticed
some things last night.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,530
Hey, Ted, can you
pass me a cracker?

16
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:01,478
Yeah.
It's the least

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,729
you can do,
considering I left

18
00:01:02,764 --> 00:01:03,979
a guy at the
altar for you.

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,697
Right, right?

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,352
Oh, come on, that was a joke.

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,160
Women over 30 don't joke
when it comes to commitment.

22
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:17,661
Victoria is happy
we're taking things slow.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,264
Oh, oh, honeysweetiebaby,

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,419
no 32-year-old woman

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,300
is happy taking things slow.

26
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,466
Mm.

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,804
Trust me, Victoria has got
friends from high school

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,226
posting pictures
of second babies on Facebook.

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,279
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,359
And you think
girlfriend's

31
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:33,473
all like, "Oh,
let's just bone a bunch

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,680
so I'm another year older
and still single"?

33
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:38,498
Bitch, please.
Mm.

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,586
Guys, I've got a new bro...

35
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:45,020
a bro that puts
all other bros to shame.

36
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,352
The bitches love him.

37
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,741
He buries bones

38
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,689
all day.

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,966
Whoo!

40
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,048
No one chases
tail like him.

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,437
Why aren't you
guys laughing?

42
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,536
Oh, wait, I probably
should have led with this:

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,690
he's a dog.

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,803
I've named him

45
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,351
Brover.

46
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:05,892
I'll go...

47
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,933
...fetch him.

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,897
Okay, I'm worried about Barney.

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,102
That breakup with Quinn messed
him up more than he let on.

50
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,674
I think he's lonely.

51
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,239
Dude seems fine to me.

52
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,328
I love you so much, Brover.

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,165
Seriously, based on last night,

54
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,728
you and Victoria
are headed for trouble.

55
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:34,287
So I got this kind of
interesting job offer

56
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,239
to run a bakery in Denver.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,925
But that's too crazy,
though, right?

58
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,929
Right?

59
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,296
Uh, yeah.

60
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,800
The high altitude would affect
the density of the pastries.

61
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:44,749
I mean,

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,433
talk about half-baked.

63
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,705
Man, this is
a great night.

64
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,974
That was Victoria asking you
to move to Denver with her.

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,159
What?

66
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,440
Then, why wouldn't
she just come right out

67
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,813
and say what she wants?

68
00:02:57,848 --> 00:02:59,226
Men.

69
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,430
It's like, if there weren't
pickle jars to open

70
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:02,780
and spiders
to kill

71
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,153
and computers to back up,
what would be their point?

72
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:07,367
Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,126
Okay, when did Marshall become
a slightly more feminine you?

74
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,421
Look, Ted, it gets exhausting
constantly giving people

75
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:18,712
advice they haven't asked for,
so I'm training Marshall.

76
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,581
My goal is
to eventually say things

77
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,555
that are so sassy
and wise,

78
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,007
that there is
no possible response

79
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,228
other than "mm"
or "mm-hmm."

80
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,262
And if this is a place where
we can share our dreams...

81
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:33,977
I like to think
that it is...

82
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,149
I hope someday
to earn a...

83
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,316
"testify."

84
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,236
Look,

85
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,906
Victoria and I are
five months in

86
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,625
and we're
right where we should be.

87
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,677
All right, we-we're cosigning
birthday cards,

88
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:48,694
w-we got toothbrushes
at each other's places,

89
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,116
foreplay's out the window.

90
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,687
I'm in, I'm out,
I'm sleeping, it's great.

91
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,087
It's more than
five months.

92
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:56,954
You guys dated before;
that time counts.

93
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,956
The clock doesn't
reset to zero.

94
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,923
It un-pauses from
where you left off.

95
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,879
No way,

96
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,297
no way, the clock resets.

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,146
Wait,

98
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:07,262
so this is what you guys do?

99
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,601
You invite other couples
over for dinner

100
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:10,516
to judge them and feel superior?

101
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,967
Oh, grow up, Ted,

102
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:16,352
that's why any couple
invites anyone over ever.

103
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,325
Two Scotches, both neat,

104
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,694
and if you've got some, uh,
nuts, this guy lost a couple.

105
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,697
Ha-ha.

106
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,813
Take the hit, just take the hit.

107
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,359
Okay, this is

108
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:28,899
a cry for help.

109
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,151
Can we invite Barney over
for dinner tonight?

110
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,510
But I was going to make you
a special meal to celebrate

111
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:35,860
my show getting nominated
for a Local Area Media Award.

112
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:37,443
<i>Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention,</i>

113
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,318
<i>Nick had</i>
<i>a cable access cooking show.</i>

114
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,185
<i>Chef Nick Podarutti uses</i>

115
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,700
<i>all fresh,</i>
<i>locally grown ingredients,</i>

116
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,417
<i>but don't think for a second</i>

117
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,704
<i>that means he's not a bad boy.</i>

118
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,261
She runs on corn.

119
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,264
♪ Nick the Bad Boy

120
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,735
♪ Chef...

121
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,269
I'm gonna invite him over
for dinner.

122
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,323
Okay, fine, but you'd better
make sure he has a ticket.

123
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,699
'Cause it's all aboard
the Chow-Chow Train!

124
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,118
Honey, I know
it's hard coming up

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,254
with a signature
cooking catchphrase,

126
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,338
but I don't think that's it.

127
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,954
I know, but how do you compete
with "Bam!"?

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,177
It just says it all.

129
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,216
Hey, you.

130
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:32,417
Hey, can I ask you
something?

131
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,635
Um, Lily and Marshall think

132
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,437
I'm missing all these hints
you're dropping

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,524
that you want
a deeper commitment.

134
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,942
I mean, you'd just come
right out and tell me, right?

135
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,256
Totally.

136
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,644
I-I think I can be a little
bit more direct than that.

137
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,599
Thank you.

138
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,200
Oh, hey, I was cleaning
my apartment today

139
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:54,101
and I dug this up.

140
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,039
Should I keep

141
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:56,870
this wedding dress,
or do you think

142
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,664
I'll never, ever need it again?

143
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,761
So Lily and Marshall
were right?

144
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,993
Of course they're right.

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,167
When a girl jumps in your
car in a wedding dress,

146
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,519
you can't act
surprised to find out

147
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,782
she wants to get married.

148
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:10,745
Besides,

149
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,867
we dated before, and
that time counts.

150
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,537
We just hit pause
on the clock.

151
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,905
See, a lot
of really smart people

152
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,475
would argue the clock resets.

153
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,877
It un-pauses,
everybody knows that.

154
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,079
You know, Barney's
a little late.

155
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,296
I hope he's okay.

156
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,581
Ah, he's fine, and
I still don't think

157
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,929
he's crying out for help.

158
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,364
Well...

159
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,685
Sorry we're late.

160
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,137
We just came from the tailor.

161
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,640
Brover couldn't settle on a tie,
so I just bought them all.

162
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:38,640
You say no to that face.

163
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,531
There's a reason
that you're not

164
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,803
a hundred percent in
this with me, Ted.

165
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:49,451
Something's holding us back.

166
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,626
Well, what is it?

167
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,877
I think we've established
I'm not great

168
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,129
at picking up on clues...
well, in this situation.

169
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,329
As a kid, I was known
as a bit of a detective.

170
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:00,580
In fact,
when my friend's retainer

171
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,686
went missing,

172
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,004
the Mosby Boys were put
on the case, and it was...

173
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,688
The retainer was
in the garbage.

174
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,670
The Mosby Boys were
you, your sister,

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,445
and a neighborhood squirrel
you thought you had tamed.

176
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,461
I can't believe Squirrel-lock
Holmes turned on us like that.

177
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:15,227
Eight weeks of training
down the drain.

178
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,263
You know how I
know that, Ted?

179
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,487
Because we covered it in the
"getting to know you" part

180
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,806
of the relationship
six years ago.

181
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,804
Six years.

182
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,480
Then...
what's holding us back?

183
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,717
Call in the
Mosby Boys, Ted,

184
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,317
let me know if they
crack the case.

185
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,925
Guys,

186
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,260
Brover is not only
the best bro I've ever had,

187
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:49,327
he's amazing with the ladies.

188
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,996
I'm sorry, don't you think
it's a little pathetic

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,767
to use a dog to pick up chicks?

190
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,388
Sir, wingmanship is
a two-way street.

191
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,725
<i>If Brover meets a cutie,</i>
<i>I'll take the hit</i>

192
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,181
<i>and chat up</i>
<i>the chubby lady friend.</i>

193
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,568
<i>Sometimes I'll be the jerk...</i>

194
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,288
<i>...so Brover can swoop in</i>
<i>and be the hero.</i>

195
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,374
<i>And like any good wingman,</i>

196
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>I gather as much intel</i>
<i>as I can right up front.</i>

197
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,539
How old's your dog?

198
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:20,579
She's five.
Oh.

199
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,914
What's that in dog years?

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,236
Like, 35.

201
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,004
We're done here.

202
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,239
Well, you were right.

203
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,140
Victoria says something's
holding us back,

204
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:32,373
and I don't have
any idea what it is.

205
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,147
Any brilliant insights, Oprah?

206
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,346
Steadman?

207
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,547
Um, try Gayle.

208
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,888
Marshall, I want you
to take this one.

209
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,415
You're ready.

210
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,940
Oh, I don't know.

211
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,241
Although I do hear this little
voice in the back of my head

212
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:50,973
trying to tell
me something.

213
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,638
That's your inner goddess.

214
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:56,297
Listen to her,
channel her.

215
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,896
If Victoria quenches your

216
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,000
thirst like a tall glass

217
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,343
of sweet tea on
a hot July day...

218
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:05,676
Marshall, why is she Southern?

219
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,843
Don't let him break
the connection.

220
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,073
...well,
you got to make

221
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
an honest woman
out of her.

222
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:10,742
Okay, I'm leaving.

223
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,565
But, but,

224
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,352
if not, well,
then, sugar...

225
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,017
...you got to let
that nightingale

226
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,306
spread her
wings and soar

227
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,592
to her own

228
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,150
beautiful tomorrow.

229
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:29,317
Testify.

230
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,454
You guys are the worst.

231
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,949
Where am I?

232
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,719
Sorry.

233
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,970
Uh, go for Barney.

234
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,588
Uh-huh.

235
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,105
I see.

236
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,957
Totally understood.

237
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,777
I'll do that.

238
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,929
Great.

239
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,946
Thank <i>you.</i>

240
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,180
That was Brover's owner.

241
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,289
I guess,
while she was

242
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,807
out of town, he ran
away from his kennel,

243
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,061
and now that she's back,
I have to return him.

244
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,640
Oh, Barney, I'm so sorry.

245
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:14,773
Oh, it's all good.

246
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,647
Um, excuse me for one moment.

247
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,291
Hey,

248
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,633
Barney.

249
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,881
No, no.
No, no!

250
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,222
Oh.

251
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,141
Wha...

252
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,847
Victoria.

253
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,285
Will you marry me?

254
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,956
Yes, of course.

255
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,303
There's just one thing.

256
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,277
Anything. You name it.

257
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,631
You can't be friends with Robin.

258
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,684
You won't marry me

259
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,140
if I'm still friends with Robin?

260
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,636
Wait. She's

261
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,905
the thing that's been
holding us back?

262
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,122
There-There's just too much
history there.

263
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:28,304
I mean, Robin's the reason
that we broke up

264
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,844
the first time around.
Robin's our roadblock.

265
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,628
Robin's the deep, dark pit

266
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:34,744
where our relationship
goes to die.

267
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,134
But nicest girl in the world.
Salt of the earth.

268
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,605
But she's with Nick now.

269
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,421
I mean, sure,
his cooking show is lousy

270
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:43,820
with awkward
catchphrase attempts.

271
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,353
Oh, my gosh,
who's ready to nosh?

272
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:48,876
Who's popping a chub
for some grub?

273
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,397
I offer my deepest apologies

274
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,267
to anyone who was offended
by my "popping a chub" remark.

275
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,303
I can and will do better.

276
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,906
Won't happen again.

277
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:02,191
And now who's ready
to eat my meat?

278
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,547
Oh, come on.

279
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,731
But Robin's happy with Nick,

280
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:10,081
and I'm happy with you.

281
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,089
Look, I,

282
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,005
I just asked you to be my wife.

283
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,258
Isn't that proof there's nothing
between me and Robin?

284
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,676
Well, maybe today there isn't,

285
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,379
but what about tomorrow?

286
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,129
Or next week
or 15 years from now?

287
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:23,213
I'll always

288
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,769
be wondering.

289
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,969
I never wanted

290
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,888
to be that girl who says

291
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,472
it's Robin or it's me,

292
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:33,805
but, well...

293
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,560
It's Robin or it's you.

294
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,368
You've been
a hell of a wingman.

295
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,651
And even though I think
it's kind of gross

296
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,483
when you
pleasure yourself orally,

297
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,619
don't ever think

298
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:48,284
that means I'm not impressed.

299
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,878
Hey...

300
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,579
do you think that Barney's
gonna be okay

301
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,828
bringing Brover back?

302
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,076
Yeah, he'll be fine.

303
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,612
It's not just the ability

304
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,417
to go to town on yourself,

305
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,502
but you do it with
such joie de vivre.

306
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,509
I really think
that I should go with him.

307
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,226
No, but you got
to eat these crêpes

308
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,355
as soon as
they're flambéed.

309
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,480
They're gonna be
bon appe-sweet!

310
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,229
No.
Damn.

311
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,513
We'll work on it
when I get back.

312
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,816
No, I get it.
You know,

313
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:18,399
I only spent all night
working on these,

314
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,016
but, hey, Barney's
more important.

315
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,571
Nick...
It's fine. Go.

316
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,578
Anyway, let's not make
a big deal of it.

317
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,479
We hung out for a few days,

318
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,213
had some fun...

319
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:30,947
No big woof.

320
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,483
I don't know who I am
without you.

321
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,535
This is crazy.

322
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,670
Victoria is being
completely unreasonable

323
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,977
about Robin,

324
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:45,160
and my snap sister
is gonna back me up.

325
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,838
I say again...

326
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,340
I kind of see Victoria's point.

327
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,756
Come again for Ms. Fudge?

328
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,517
Ted and Robin have
so much history.

329
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:01,274
Exactly. History.
Ancient history.

330
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,848
Ted, you said "I love you"
to her earlier this year.

331
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,997
I'm not saying

332
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:08,998
this is fair, but I get it.

333
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,350
I didn't get that at all.

334
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,828
How could my inner goddess
be so far off?

335
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,129
Oh, you'll get there, honey.

336
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,262
Oprah wasn't built in a day.

337
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:22,062
Uh-oh.
What?

338
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,388
I kind of went rogue.

339
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,521
Look, if you really want
to have a baby,

340
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,536
just stop taking the pill.

341
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,340
You guys slept together
at spring break

342
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,872
three years ago.

343
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,507
That means something.

344
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,210
Loves show tunes,

345
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,948
total shopaholic,

346
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:41,013
not always pestering you
for sex?

347
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,720
Um, Clifford
sounds like a keeper.

348
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,829
Marshall, all of that advice
was terrible.

349
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,029
Not as terrible as you saying

350
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,896
that Ted and Robin
should stop being friends.

351
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,918
I'm not saying they should.
It would be horrible.

352
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,866
But if Ted

353
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:57,601
really wants to be
with Victoria...

354
00:14:57,636 --> 00:15:00,651
Ted, tell her

355
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,027
that you're not gonna
stop being friends with Robin.

356
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,344
I can't imagine
life without Robin.

357
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,467
But she'll never be
in love with me.

358
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,633
She'll never be

359
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,280
my wife.

360
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,386
She'll never be

361
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:17,121
the person I grow old with.

362
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:19,854
Victoria...

363
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,110
Victoria could be.

364
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,282
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

365
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,125
You ready to say good-bye?

366
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,007
Thanks for coming with me.

367
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,877
Oh, well,
you did the same for me

368
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,797
back when I had to give away
all my dogs. Remember?

369
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,584
Oh, yeah, we drove
to your aunt's farm upstate.

370
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,057
She was awesome.

371
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,137
Yeah.
I love how she

372
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:53,386
was this wise, old, chilled out,

373
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,705
lesbian farmer.

374
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,257
No, no, no.
She's not a lesbian.

375
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,776
Nor does she farm them.

376
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,079
No, that woman
she lives with,

377
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,481
that's just
her special friend Maureen.

378
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,940
They've lived together for...

379
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:08,174
Oh.

380
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,139
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

381
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,025
Brover really was
the best wingman ever.

382
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,255
Oh, my God.

383
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,607
Thank you so much for bringing

384
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,591
Mr. Sprinkles back.
Mr. Sprinkles...

385
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,707
is a great name for a dog.

386
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,677
Mommy missed you so much.

387
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,995
Yes, she did.

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,001
Did this nice couple
take care of you?

389
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,110
That's a laugh. Ha.

390
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:43,842
Big bro.

391
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,551
I got to split.
Yeah, I got to,

392
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,443
I got to head back
to the farm...

393
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,780
where I live with my
special friend Maureen.

394
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,029
Whom I now realize

395
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,147
is my lesbian
life partner.

396
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,850
Surprise.

397
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,572
Okay. All right.

398
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,708
So...

399
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:04,573
would you like a drink?

400
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,831
Best wingman ever.

401
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,306
Hey.

402
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:18,823
What's all this?

403
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,879
I thought you were
mad at me.

404
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,476
I was...

405
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:23,809
but then I realized

406
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,788
I just have to accept
that you have close guy friends.

407
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,817
I mean, I don't want it
becoming a habit

408
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:30,834
that they steal you away from me
in the middle of the night.

409
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,439
But...

410
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,223
Oh, sorry.

411
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,524
Oh, Ted needs to see me.

412
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,737
Oh, for the love of God, woman.
Oh, it's not

413
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,944
what you think.
He just wants to have sex.

414
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,915
Kidding.

415
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,666
Just a little hand stuff.

416
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,085
Ha. Kidding again.

417
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,571
Ted's more of a boob man.
I seriously can't stop.

418
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,176
What does he want?
Um...

419
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:54,960
I don't know,
but he says it's urgent.

420
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,414
I'm so sorry.

421
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,920
Just one more little
steal-away.

422
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,420
Just as long
as he gives you back.

423
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,420
Thanks.

424
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,475
So...

425
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,257
are you okay?

426
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,990
What is this big, urgent thing

427
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,250
that couldn't wait
till tomorrow?

428
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,914
There's something
I have to tell you.

429
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,287
Um...

430
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,172
I've thought about this a ton,

431
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,221
and, um...

432
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,630
I was hoping it wouldn't
come to this,

433
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,847
but...

434
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,965
I'm not in love with Robin, um,

435
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,805
but she's like family to me,
and, uh...

436
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,810
I can't end that.

437
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,375
So...

438
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,111
can you accept that?

439
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,046
I really hope
you get her some day.

440
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,091
Hey, guys.

441
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:34,323
Hey.
Hey.

442
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,777
So, last night

443
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:40,679
Ted calls me out to the bar
to talk about something urgent.

444
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,198
Guess what it was.

445
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:43,706
He wants to write

446
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,878
a series of young adult
mystery novels

447
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,758
called <i>The Mosby Boys.</i>

448
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:52,190
Why did you need
to tell me that?

449
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,496
You work in the media.
You know people.

450
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:56,664
Okay, well, first of all,
lose the Mosby nerds

451
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,670
and focus on
that crime-solving squirrel.

452
00:19:58,705 --> 00:19:59,727
That guy is gold.
Yeah.

453
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:00,749
And secondly, next time

454
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,533
you have a big idea
late at night,

455
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,307
please bug
your girlfriend about it.

456
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,176
Uh, actually...

457
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,361
Victoria and I broke up.

458
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:10,226
Oh, my God.

459
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,645
Why, what,
what happened?

460
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,597
We just, you know,
wanted different things.

461
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,983
I'm so sorry, buddy.

462
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:22,856
But, bright side...

463
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,027
Robin is gonna be so touched

464
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,830
when she hears you ended
things with Victoria

465
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:27,862
because of her.

466
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,167
She can never know.

467
00:20:29,202 --> 00:20:32,168
Promise me
Robin will never find out.

468
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,619
I don't understand.

469
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,586
Promise.

470
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,889
Promise.
Promise.

471
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:39,189
<i>Of course,</i>

472
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,790
<i>Robin did find out.</i>

473
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,267
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

474
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,943
So you do have balls?

475
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,497
Run!
