00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:05,588
<i> Kids, in the fall of 2010, our friends
Stuart and Claudia had a baby,</i>

2
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:08,956
<i>and Marshall and Lily were the first
to visit the happy new parents.</i>

3
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,926
So, have you guys
landed on a name yet?

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,302
We're trying, but it's tougher than
you think. You see, I like "Tiffany."

5
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:16,782
And I don't want my daughter
to have a whore's name.

6
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:18,601
- That's my mother's name.
- I know.

7
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:23,105
I got it. How'bout we name the baby
after you... "Frigid Shrew."

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,279
That's good.

9
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,942
Let's call her "Vodka."

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,853
Then at least we know you'd hold her
tight and never let her go!

11
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:32,552
Don't knock the vodka.
Wouldn't have a kid without it.

12
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:35,242
Stuart, you are so...

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,542
That's not gonna be us, right?
I mean,

14
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,330
how hard can it be to name a baby?

15
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,123
Right?
I mean, just look at her.

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,594
She's clearly a...

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,069
- Lisa.
- Emily.

18
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:45,644
- Emily?!
- Lisa?!

.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

24
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:06,401
I made a list of awesome baby names.

25
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,317
Starting at the top: number one...

26
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,519
I'm gonna stop you
right here, Marshall.

27
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:12,690
You name a chubby
white kid "LeBron,"

28
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:15,157
and he's the one getting
stuffed in the basketball hoop.

29
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,074
Then I'm also crossing off,
"Shaquille"...

30
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:19,716
"Hakeem,"

31
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,831
and "Dikembe."

32
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:24,225
What about "Rob"?

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,350
"Rob"?

34
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:26,877
Why not?

35
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,630
Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make?
A turkey?

36
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:32,425
Honka, honka!

37
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:36,113
Not "Rob."

38
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:39,004
How about "Ryan"?

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,563
Not "Ryan."

40
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,398
"Johnny?"

41
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,692
Hey, where's the goldfish?

42
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:56,645
Not "Johnny."

43
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,466
Or "Gil."

44
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:03,745
"Jeremy."

45
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:14,412
Definitely not "Jeremy."

46
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:16,719
His stuff was so derivative.

47
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:18,888
Well, I mean, geez, Lily.

48
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,224
Well, whatever you do, do not
name your baby "Becky," right?

49
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,726
Why? What?

50
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,520
Becky. My new co-anchor?

51
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:28,981
Don't you guys ever watch the show?

52
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,965
- I really try.
- Our DVR won't recognize it

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,318
as a television program.

54
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,013
I watched.

55
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,376
Robin insisted I confirm
how "awful" Becky is,

56
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,551
so last night I checked it out.

57
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,532
Peace talks in the region
have been described as "productive."

58
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:44,657
Becky?

59
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,626
Last night, in Staten Island,

60
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,388
a taco cart owner
was robbed at gunpoint.

61
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,963
That's so sad.

62
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,586
Becky, we're journalists.

63
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:57,468
We can't get emotional
about the news, we...

64
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,144
They stole all his money and then
pelted him with his own taco meat!

65
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:02,598
Who would do that?

66
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,975
If you read the story,
we might find out.

67
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,211
Can I do this one, about the horse?

68
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,731
I love horseys.

69
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,377
The horse died.

70
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,020
Guys!

71
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,395
This news is all really sad.

72
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:21,747
Okay, no holds barred...

73
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,873
What'd you think of Becky?

74
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:30,918
- I thought she was charming.
- You, too?

75
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,630
Can somebody please explain to me
why the little girl act works on men?

76
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,131
Long or short version?

77
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,633
Short version.

78
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,001
Short version.

79
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:40,636
Who's your daddy?

80
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,490
You know, when you think about that,

81
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,371
that phrase is really creepy.

82
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:46,879
No, it's not. It's fun.

83
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,354
Here, watch this.

84
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:52,393
Who's your daddy?

85
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,354
Let me get this straight.
So, in this scenario,

86
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,686
because you make such
sweet love to Lily,

87
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,154
she is now your daughter.

88
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:02,056
No, she is not my daughter.
I'm just...

89
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:03,181
her daddy.

90
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,034
- That is disgusting.
- Exactly. And it's not like

91
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,476
the opposite would work. There's no way
a guy could pick up a girl, going around

92
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,876
- talking like a little boy.
- Challenge accepted.

93
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:13,836
I, Barney Stinson,

94
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:17,131
will pick up a girl
whilst talking like a little boy.

95
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,221
Here's my list of baby names.

96
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,746
What about "Tara"?

97
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,404
Not "Tara." Tara was
the hottest girl in my high school.

98
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,268
We were all, like,
obsessed with her.

99
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:32,853
<i> We didn't just talk about her
and fantasize about her...</i>

100
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,728
<i>We wrote songs about her.</i>

101
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:36,610
<i>Tara</i>

102
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,529
<i>Your booty is so smooth</i>

103
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:45,103
<i>And I hope this isn't rude</i>

104
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:47,562
<i>But I want to get up on it.</i>

105
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,629
Not "Tara."

106
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,524
What about "Esther"?

107
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,256
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Coming up on the main stage,</i>

108
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,202
<i>give it up for Esther!</i>

109
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:06,482
That prime rib was surprisingly good,
but it's 10:30 in the morning.

110
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,807
I don't need to see a lady
get naked and dance.

111
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,352
Esther gets naked.
But she doesn't dance.

112
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,120
Then what does she do?

113
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,805
Sweet mother nature!

114
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,410
That was my card!

115
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:33,255
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Give it up for Esther!</i>

116
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,295
Not "Esther."

117
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,632
I need a drink. Ted? Ted?

118
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,136
Your list is entirely boy names.

119
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:51,350
You do realize there's roughly a 50%
chance of you having a daughter, right?

120
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,769
Honestly, I've never thought
about having a girl.

121
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:56,041
I don't wannna think
about having a girl.

122
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,343
Tara, Esther...

123
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,566
can you imagine being one
of those girls' dads?

124
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,681
<i>Marshall's daughter</i>

125
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,113
<i>Your booty</i>

126
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,366
<i>Your booty's so smooth.</i>

127
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,035
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen.
On the main stage,</i>

128
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,998
<i>give it up for Marshall's daughter.</i>

129
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:17,833
He screwed up my childhood.

130
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,508
That's why I do this.

131
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,717
I have no idea how
to raise a daughter!

132
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:28,950
What if she makes bad choices? I mean,
what if she winds up dating some...

133
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,601
Papa, I want you to meet
my new boyfriend.

134
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,062
Hey, bro.

135
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,817
Thanks for making such a hottie.

136
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:44,737
Who's your daddy?

137
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,281
You are,
'cause of all the sex we have.

138
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,580
I don't want a girl.
I just want a little boy.

139
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,640
It's not what it sounds like, folks.

140
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,130
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

141
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:07,657
<i>Is that you?</i>

142
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:11,970
You're a little too close
to the camera. Can you back up a bit?

143
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,649
<i>How's this?</i>

144
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:17,788
Every time.

145
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,638
Can you just sit
in front of the computer

146
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:22,139
like normal human beings?

147
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:24,554
Perfect! Perfect.

148
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,129
<i>What's up, shooter?</i>

149
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:30,517
To be honest, I'm getting a freaked out
about the idea of having a daughter.

150
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:33,950
You two probably aren't the right people
to talk to about this. You had all boys.

151
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:36,025
<i>Well, that was just dumb luck.</i>

152
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,200
<i>Hey, honey,</i>

153
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:39,630
<i>would you get me a brewski
from out of the shed?</i>

154
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,458
<i>Sure. You want anything, Marshall?</i>

155
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,043
I'm in a computer, Mom.

156
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,480
<i>Yeah, all boys.</i>

157
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,325
<i>Total co-winky-dink.</i>

158
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,325
<i>It was no co-winky-dink.</i>

159
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,555
<i>Since the Viking age, the Eriksen men
have passed down ancient secrets</i>

160
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,180
<i>for conceiving boys.</i>

161
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,790
<i>Number one, avoid lemons.</i>

162
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,895
<i>They're baby girl fertilizer.</i>

163
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:06,066
No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's
any scientific data to support...

164
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:09,152
<i>"I doubt there's any
scientific data to support..."</i>

165
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:12,336
<i>I had all sons.
Your grandfather had all sons.</i>

166
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:15,742
<i>Your great-grandfather had all sons.
Scoreboard!</i>

167
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:20,386
<i>Who you gonna listen to?
Me? Or "scientific data"?</i>

168
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,927
Members of the G-8
convened today in Vienna

169
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:29,478
to discuss plans to fight
climate change by re... What?

170
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:31,742
Ask me what I did yesterday.

171
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:35,679
Tthis is our news segment, okay?
Nobody cares what you did yesterday.

172
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,439
Lighten up, Robin.

173
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,015
What'd you do, sweetheart?

174
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,054
Well, I'm new in town and
don't know many people.

175
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,854
But yesterday,
I met the sweetest man,

176
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,179
who took me on a tour of the city.

177
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,112
Guys, New York is kind of cool.

178
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:54,607
Okay, back to the G-8 conference.

179
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,030
Hello?

180
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,055
Mike, can I get in the shot?

181
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,663
Fantastic.

182
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:05,108
Then this cutie patootie took me
to this bar called MacLaren's,

183
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,493
- right underneath his apartment.
- Wait...

184
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:09,618
Did you go out with Ted Mosby?

185
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,979
Guys, I went out with
Robin's roommate.

186
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:14,920
I saw her bedroom.

187
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,342
She's a messy Bessie.

188
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,727
In other news, later today,

189
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,852
a Manhattan architect
gets punched in the throat.

190
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,147
Of all the women in New York,

191
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,482
you had to go out
with an eight-year-old girl?

192
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,985
Not what it sounds like.

193
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:36,031
You know that I hate her.
How could you go out with this girl?

194
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,341
It wasn't a date.

195
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:39,534
She came over to the apartment
looking for you.

196
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:43,095
I made Robin my famous
chocolate chip cookies.

197
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,697
But instead of chocolate chips,
I used gummie bears.

198
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,135
A spider!

199
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,092
Let me guess: she acted
like a helpless little girl,

200
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,677
and you stepped in as the big,
strong man.

201
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,223
I don't know if that's totally true.

202
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:06,228
It's okay, darlin'.

203
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:07,926
Poor spider.

204
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,865
Spiders gotta die,

205
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:15,297
so trees can grow.

206
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:19,145
Then I held her tight

207
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:22,002
and told her
it was all gonna be okay.

208
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,766
By the way, I think
I only wounded the spider.

209
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,332
It crawled off into my bedroom.

210
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,376
Is that why you slept
on the couch last night?

211
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:31,827
I slept.

212
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:34,830
I'm dying out here.

213
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,635
Talking like a little boy
is not working with the ladies.

214
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:40,971
Wow, lady.

215
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:43,682
You got some tig ol'bitties!

216
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,103
Gosh!

217
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:50,087
Your body's a perfect...

218
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:52,073
this many.

219
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,821
Do you want to wrestle
with our special bathing suit places?

220
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:00,410
Come on!

221
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:03,527
I need two seconds, baby.

222
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:06,663
I know you think that's a compliment,
but I'd rather you took your time.

223
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:09,624
I'll be right back.

224
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:21,748
Ancient Norse wisdom tells us that,
to sire a son,

225
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:24,889
you must do three things right
before you lay with your maiden.

226
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,767
First, eat pickled herring.

227
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:30,729
Eat it!

228
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:32,843
This is ridiculous.

229
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:40,764
Gentlemen, on the main stage,
throwing her life away,

230
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,033
give it up for Marshall's daughter!

231
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:48,667
Who's your granddaddy?

232
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:51,249
That guy.

233
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:05,134
Want to have a three-way
with me and my imaginary friend?

234
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,489
His name's Otis.

235
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,596
Want to come to my house
and play telephone?

236
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:14,814
I got the string, you got the cans.

237
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:19,110
I wet myself!

238
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:20,445
Will you change me?

239
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,852
Can't blame her on that one.

240
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,243
Guys...

241
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,008
I have some terrible news.

242
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:30,612
I,

243
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:31,816
Barney Stinson,

244
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:36,119
can't pick up a girl whilst
talking like a little boy.

245
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:38,501
Challenge forfeited.

246
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:43,093
- We don't care about this.
- No one challenged you,

247
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,159
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,626
Gerard, what's with that shirt?

249
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,815
Nobody could pick up
a chick wearing that thing.

250
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,605
Challenge accept...

251
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:58,613
I'm glad that's over.

252
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:01,236
It was creepy watching Barney
talk like a little kid.

253
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,530
But you find it irresistible
when Becky does?

254
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,864
I don't get it.

255
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:07,453
The Ted that I went out with was
attracted to the kind of woman

256
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,869
who could use a steak knife
without supervision.

257
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:13,755
For your information, Becky doesn't like
steak, she likes "spasghetti".

258
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,819
Spaghetti.

259
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:17,043
And more importantly,
she makes me feel needed.

260
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:18,262
Needed?

261
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,588
She makes training
wheels feel needed.

262
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:23,234
It's nice to feel needed.
And you know what?

263
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,343
It's not a feeling guys
get when they're with you.

264
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:32,657
Son...

265
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:36,522
Viking lore tells us that
to ensure the continuation

266
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:38,280
of your noble male lineage...

267
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,282
get a big bowl of ice

268
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:43,385
and dunk your man
sack right in there!

269
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:46,559
You two and your football.

270
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,611
Now get in there,
point Lily due north

271
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,708
and make me a grandson!

272
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,738
When we were dating,
I didn't make you feel needed?

273
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,574
Come on! You always took
charge of everything.

274
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,119
I got this.

275
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:38,652
- This okay? Am I hurting y...
- I got this.

276
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:44,104
Someone's trying to break in.
Call the cops.

277
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,901
I got this.

278
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,261
Did that bother you?

279
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,639
Yeah. It's nice to be needed.

280
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,803
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

281
00:14:58,709 --> 00:14:59,709
It's Becky.

282
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,106
She's trapped in a revolving door.

283
00:15:04,722 --> 00:15:05,722
I got this.

284
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,909
Let's make a baby!

285
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,831
You're packing snowballs,
and your breath smells like a fart.

286
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,751
You know what's hotter?

287
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,630
If we face this way.

288
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,176
Ooh, we're bad.

289
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,550
Baby, why are you facing me north?

290
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,387
You're trying to make us have a boy.

291
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,129
I can ex...

292
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,642
How do you know?

293
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:41,604
What are you doing with lemons?

294
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,066
Baby girl fertilizer!

295
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,819
You're trying to have a girl!

296
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,449
<i>You are trying to have a girl.</i>

297
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,911
All my least favorite students
have been boys.

298
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:59,913
So I Googled "how to make a girl",

299
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:02,518
some really weird stuff came up,

300
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:06,546
but I found this conception website
that said you should...

301
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:09,572
<i>point south
at the moment of conception...</i>

302
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:11,562
<i>eat a lemon...</i>

303
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,010
<i>and heat up your lady parts
to a balmy 105 degrees.</i>

304
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:27,275
That's not bad.

305
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,274
How could you do...

306
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:39,579
exactly the same thing I did?
You're supposed to be the sane one.

307
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:40,822
See that?

308
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:43,683
Another boy expecting a woman
to clean up his mistakes.

309
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:45,752
That's why girls
are better than boys.

310
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,589
Why creepy kids in a horror movie
are always little girls?

311
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:53,468
Or twin girls, who speak...
in unison.

312
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:55,303
What about Chucky?

313
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,897
A) He was a doll;

314
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:00,815
<i>B) He was possessed
by an adult serial killer;</i>

315
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,996
and C) How could you bring
up Chucky right before bed?

316
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:15,121
When we were dating,

317
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,406
did I make you feel needed?

318
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,409
No, I didn't feel
like you needed me at all.

319
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:22,307
That's what I thought.

320
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,512
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,657
Wwhere are you...
That's a compliment.

322
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:31,337
You are the least needy woman
I've ever met, that's awesome.

323
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:35,147
No guy's gonna say
"Who's your daddy?" to you.

324
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:36,604
You're your own daddy.

325
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:38,003
And mommy.

326
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,483
And weird survivalist uncle

327
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:43,265
who lives in a cabin with a gun
blaming the government.

328
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:48,303
That is what makes you the most...

329
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:51,377
amazing, strong...

330
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:54,713
independent woman I've ever banged.

331
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,617
There's something
I wanted to ask you,

332
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:06,163
and I don't really know
how to say it so... here goes.

333
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,598
Who's the crazy chick in the apron?

334
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:13,755
Someone naughty
left his toys on the floor

335
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,383
and needs to be spanked
on his tushy-tush.

336
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm in "twubble."

337
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,640
You did it?
How?

338
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,750
Last night, after admitting defeat,

339
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,644
I just let myself go.

340
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,856
That looks so good.
Can I have some?

341
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:35,717
It's my ice cream,
you can't have any.

342
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,238
Someone needs to teach you
how to share.

343
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,433
Who's your mommy?

344
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,916
Challenge completed!

345
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:55,045
Can you get her out?
I'm scared.

346
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:56,922
I got this.

347
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,947
So you finally agreed on a name?

348
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:10,561
The other night she ran
a really high fever.

349
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:13,485
<i>We rushed her to the ER
at 3:00 in the morning,</i>

350
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,247
<i>but they wouldn't admit her
without a name.</i>

351
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,495
Right then,

352
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,740
we realized
how stupid we were being.

353
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:24,742
We looked at each other

354
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,145
and we just knew.

355
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,219
Our baby's name is...

356
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:30,539
Esther.

357
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:36,702
Beautiful.

358
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:41,817
We're idiots.

359
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:45,873
Names and gender, it's like...

360
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:49,882
it's some way of giving ourselves
the illusion that we have any control.

361
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:52,841
I just want a healthy,
happy, 12-pound...

362
00:19:55,148 --> 00:19:56,148
Ten-pound?

363
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,647
- Eight-pound?
- I guess,

364
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:02,490
but you're writing checks
my vagina can't cash.

365
00:20:04,424 --> 00:20:05,474
I love you.

366
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:08,996
And I'm gonna love the crap
out of whatever baby we have.

367
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:10,204
Me, too.

368
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:17,628
You know what?

369
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,006
We should just think of a name
that's good for either a girl or a boy.

370
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,091
Like...

371
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,550
Jamie.

372
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:28,180
We just named our baby.

373
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:35,563
Not Jamie.

374
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:46,565
Shoe's untied. I got it.

375
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,502
This is over.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
