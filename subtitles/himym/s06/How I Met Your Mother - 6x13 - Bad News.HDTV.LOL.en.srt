1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:03,168
Kids, when Lily and Marshall
started trying to have a baby,

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,536
they went a little crazy.

3
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,772
We've been trying and trying,

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,441
and still nothing's happened.

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,244
I'm just worried
we can't have children.

6
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,712
And how long
have you been trying?

7
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,681
Six days.

8
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,850
Oy.

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,387
But then, months went by,
and still nothing happened.

10
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,621
Something must be wrong.

11
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,823
W... we're doing it a lot.

12
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,091
And everywhere...

13
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,261
the kitchen, the bathroom,
the living room,

14
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,797
outside in your
wait... the kitchen.

15
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,032
Seriously, Doc,

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,967
why isn't this happening?

17
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,936
Look, if you're really worried,
here is a number

18
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:40,706
for a reproductive
endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel.

19
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,442
He's the best in the city.

20
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:43,568
Dr. John Stangel?

21
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,610
I don't know, baby, do we
really need a specialist?

22
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,179
Well, what's your
plan, Marshall,

23
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,582
just have unprotected sex
day after day after day

24
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,884
in every position imaginable

25
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,419
until...?

26
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,555
Wait, it sounded
worse in my head.

27
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,557
Guys, we've got a problem.

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,858
This is the application

29
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,960
for the regional doubles

30
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,861
laser tag tournament

31
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,196
in Poughkeepsie.

32
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,665
Problem is, only one of you
can be my partner.

33
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,968
So it looks like we've got
a bake-off.

34
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,869
You may now present
your arguments.

35
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,938
- I'm not playing laser tag.
- I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.

36
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,806
- Damn it.
- And Marshall's the winner.

37
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,043
Well, I'm gonna
call Dr. Stangel.

38
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,511
It can't hurt.

39
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,314
So Aunt Lily went to see
Dr. John Stangel, the man

40
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:23,983
who knew more
about human reproduction

41
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,985
than anyone in New York City.

42
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:29,488
So I understand
you want to get pregnant.

43

Transcript by Addic7ed.com

44
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:48,068
- Yeah, and it cuts in and out.
- Ooh!

45
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:49,904
How did you do it?

46
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:52,840
Oh, God, you found
one of the cameras.

47
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:54,108
I swear that's the only one.

48
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,342
Wait, which one did you find?

49
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:56,443
What are you talking about?

50
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:58,078
What are you talking about?

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,549
My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.

52
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,050
We'll look at all the factors
that contribute to fertility:

53
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:06,420
dietary, environmental, genetic.

54
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,622
But first, Ms. Aldrin,

55
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:10,291
do you have any questions for me?

56
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,161
Just one, "Dr. Stangel".

57
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:15,796
Where'd you get the beard?

58
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:20,201
Well, m... my mother's Armenian.

59
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:23,270
Lily, I've been
with Barney since 9:00 a.m.

60
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,105
Between the sexual harassment
seminar all morning

61
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:27,341
and the secretary
beauty pageant all afternoon,

62
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,476
he hasn't left my sight.

63
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:31,912
Wait, so you weren't wearing
a fake beard

64
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:33,981
and examining girl parts all day?

65
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:36,116
Not today I wasn't.

66
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:38,385
Wow, we finally found
Barney's doppelganger.

67
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:40,187
I guess we can tell you now, Lily.

68
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:43,724
That hot dog guy
did not look like Barney.

69
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:44,892
Uh, Marshall?

70
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,227
Yes, I know, we made
our little deal

71
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,528
with the universe, but...

72
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,964
No, we've made a binding
covenant with the universe.

73
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:51,999
We said we weren't going
to try to have kids

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,301
until we saw
Barney's doppelganger.

75
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:56,103
Oh, this is bad news.

76
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:59,740
This is like a black cat
walked through my uterus.

77
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,941
Okay, that's it.

78
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,543
I am going back to Dr. Stangel

79
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:03,844
and getting
thoroughly checked out.

80
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:04,812
Or...

81
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:06,881
or cost-saving alternative:

82
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:09,950
you could get checked out by
someone who looks just like him.

83
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:12,086
I'm gonna go scrub up;
I'll meet you in stall three.

84
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,389
I still kind of think it's Barney.

85
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:18,792
There's no way it's Barney.

86
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,461
Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen.

87
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,096
I am Dr. Stangel.

88
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:23,230
It's Barney.

89
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,798
Wow.

90
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,835
Really, dude, bravo.

91
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:29,336
You almost got a peek.

92
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:30,571
But seriously,

93
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:33,274
what second-rate community
theater did you get...?

94
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:35,342
- Would you...?
- I...

95
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:39,680
So my wife and I
are trying to get pregnant.

96
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:43,083
All right, Ms. Aldrin,
please just put

97
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:44,251
your feet up in the stirrups.

98
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:45,686
We can begin.

99
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:46,654
Uh-uh, no.

100
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,555
- Can't do it.
- No, but, baby,

101
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:49,990
I yanked on his beard.

102
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,292
He checks out.

103
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,860
- I really don't have time for this.
- No, Barney...

104
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,962
Doctor, wait, please, it's...

105
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:56,664
Can you just give us
a couple minutes?

106
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:57,831
- I...
- Lily,

107
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:01,936
how can I convince you
that this is not Barney?

108
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:05,406
Wow, it is like looking

109
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:08,275
into a poorly dressed mirror.

110
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:15,516
Okay, you have to go.

111
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:20,487
Leave the model of the vagina.

112
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:23,424
Okay.

113
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:24,591
Convinced.

114
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:26,260
Great. All right,

115
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:28,095
you're a little low on the table.
Please scoot up.

116
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:29,797
"Suit up"... not convinced.

117
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:32,066
This whole thing stinks
to high heaven.

118
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,068
Baby, you just saw Barney.

119
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,770
He could have pulled
some crazy switch.

120
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:39,573
Remember when his
Swedish cousin came to visit?

121
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:41,508
Oh, yeah... Bjorney.

122
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,245
Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless
I see Barney at the same time,

123
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:48,816
I... I'll never be sure
that Dr. Stangel isn't him.

124
00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:51,218
How you doing, Lily?!

125
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:53,654
Should I have a boner?!

126
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:54,788
Okay, we're all done.

127
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,523
I'll call you in a few days
with the results.

128
00:04:56,524 --> 00:04:57,825
Thank you.

129
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,860
Hey, you don't mind
if I take pictures, do you?!

130
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,063
Can we leave him
in here for a while?

131
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:04,031
I'm done for the day.

132
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:05,432
You can leave him
in here all night.

133
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:09,470
Aw, yeah.

134
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:11,638
Smile for the birdie, Lil!

135
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:15,809
Gyno-mite!

136
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,945
Now, while all this was going on,

137
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:21,181
your Aunt Robin was starting
her new job at World Wide News,

138
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:22,583
aka the big leagues.

139
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:23,851
She was excited.

140
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:25,019
This job was a new start,

141
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,720
a clean slate.

142
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:29,456
So, first day of work?

143
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:34,161
Everyone, say hello to
your new research associate

144
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:35,195
Robin Scherbatsky.

145
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:37,031
- Hi, guys.
- Welcome.

146
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,066
Oh, here comes our
new Hardfire host.

147
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,236
Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.

148
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:43,971
Sandy Rivers?!

149
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:45,339
Sandy Rivers...

150
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,741
Robin's old co-host
and my old nemesis.

151
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:49,810
We should have sex.

152
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,812
Oh, I hate that guy.

153
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,147
It gets worse.

154
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,548
Sandy, this is...

155
00:05:54,549 --> 00:05:56,216
Robin.

156
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:58,285
- You two know each other?
- Know each other?

157
00:05:58,286 --> 00:05:59,319
We've had sex.

158
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,821
You had sex

159
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,189
with Sandy Rivers?

160
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,524
No! Ugh!

161
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,692
And I can't believe
it's my first day,

162
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:08,529
and already I'm the girl who
slept with the host of the show.

163
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,763
Already?

164
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,365
Were you planning on eventually
sleeping with the host?

165
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,901
Well, now that I know
it's Sandy, I'm not.

166
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:19,006
Hey, babe.

167
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,174
Hi, honey.

168
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:21,909
There's a couple messages
on the machine.

169
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,110
Your dad called.

170
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:25,112
He wants to know
if you have any sixes.

171
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:27,881
Yeah, uh, we got a game of
"Go Fish" going on the phone.

172
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,116
P.S., Pops, go fish.

173
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:34,621
Who's the second message from?

174
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:36,290
Dr. Stangel's office.

175
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,359
- I'm extremely fertile.
- You're extremely fertile!

176
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,494
Oh, my God.

177
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:42,262
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

178
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:44,364
I got to call my dad and
tell him the good news.

179
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:50,604
...puts the ball
on the 44-yard-line.

180
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:58,145
If you're fertile, um, then
that means I'm the problem.

181
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,081
Okay, now you're being ridiculous.

182
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:06,482
An hour ago, you didn't even think

183
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,517
there was a problem.

184
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,352
Well, I was just putting
on a brave face.

185
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:11,821
Okay, think about it:
we've had unprotected sex

186
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:14,991
203 times in the
past four months.

187
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:17,527
Obviously I'm the problem.

188
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:18,528
Problem?!

189
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:19,829
You can't get a girl pregnant.

190
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,930
That's the dream.

191
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,365
I'd give my firstborn

192
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,301
to not be able to have children.

193
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:29,038
So, second day of work?

194
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:31,841
What's wrong?

195
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,676
Oh, you didn't hear?
She's the office slut.

196
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:34,677
Already?

197
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,112
Oh, honey.

198
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,915
I wish I was the office slut.

199
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:43,252
And we can explore how those
policy changes will affect Iraq.

200
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,655
Yes.

201
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,690
We definitely had sex.

202
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,125
We did not have sex.

203
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:50,793
Then why do I remember you?

204
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:54,730
I don't know, maybe because
I'm a smart, talented, professional.

205
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,299
No, none of those.

206
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,333
Oh, I remember.

207
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,435
We didn't have sex.

208
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:00,770
Thank you.

209
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,705
You're the girl
who did the report

210
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:03,673
on the carriage driver

211
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:06,042
and slipped and fell
in horse poop...

212
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:07,043
We did have sex.

213
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:09,045
Oh, I... I remember now.

214
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,112
Gregory,

215
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:12,949
do me a favor.

216
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,384
But this reporter
takes pride in... whoa!

217
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:20,189
And now everyone calls me
Scherpoopie.

218
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,359
- It's not funny.
- Robin,

219
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,927
a word of advice: play along.

220
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:27,463
Okay, the more you fight it,
the worse it's going to get.

221
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:28,931
It's like when your car
slides on ice,

222
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,499
- you steer into the skid.
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,634
Exactly!

224
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,069
Or when your... I don't know...

225
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,804
friend invites you
to a laser tag tournament,

226
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,805
you don't fight it.

227
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,373
You just strap on
the vinyl holster

228
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:38,874
and race into that
abandoned JCPenney

229
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,443
guns a-blazin'.

230
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:42,778
I'm just agreeing with Ted.

231
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,649
Oh, it's my dad.

232
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:51,954
Aren't you going to get it?

233
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:53,623
No, no, you know what?

234
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:56,091
Um, I'm gonna get my
stuff checked out first.

235
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:58,959
I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel
gives me the thumbs up.

236
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:01,731
- Ew!
- He has to do that?

237
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,233
But I thought you talk
to your dad about everything.

238
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:06,302
I only like to call
my dad with good news.

239
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,603
I mean, telling him good news

240
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:09,772
is what makes it feel real to me.

241
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,173
I'm getting married!

242
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,009
Yeah...!

243
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,510
I passed the bar!

244
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,312
All right!

245
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:17,947
I found an amazing Viking lamp

246
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,415
that fits right on the coffee table,

247
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,584
as long as we don't mind
stepping over the cord.

248
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:23,886
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Right?!

249
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:26,489
I found someone
who can fix the Viking lamp!

250
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,527
But the news that
I might not be able

251
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:32,928
to give him a grandchild?

252
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:34,930
You know, like,
I don't even know

253
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:36,766
how to have that conversation.

254
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,502
I'll show you.

255
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:42,605
"Dad, there's, uh, there's
something I need to tell you,

256
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:45,708
and it's going to come
as a bit of a shock to you,

257
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,843
but here goes.

258
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,011
You are speaking

259
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:52,982
to the 2011 Tri-County
Laser Tag Co-Champion".

260
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,284
- Barney, I've already told...
- "Oh, and my sperm don't work.

261
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:56,385
Yeah, yeah,

262
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:59,388
the laser tag thing is awesome".

263
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,760
So, third day of work?

264
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,464
And the fertilizer is seeping

265
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:10,333
into the ground water,
causing...

266
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:13,069
Is Scherpoopie pitching
a story about manure?

267
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,339
Genius.

268
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,076
Okay, yes, I, uh,
I fell into some manure.

269
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,677
It's hilarious, fine.

270
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,946
In a five-year career
of on-air reports,

271
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:26,549
there are bound to be
a few embarrassing moments.

272
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,384
A few?

273
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:32,054
Uh, but in my case,
it was just the one,

274
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:34,824
and you found it, so, uh...

275
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,225
Just the one.

276
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,096
Gregory.

277
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,230
Oh, God.

278
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:43,265
What did they find?

279
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,406
Everything.

00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:54,510

292
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:22,872
They even found the video of me
getting attacked by an owl.

293
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:24,573
You got attacked by an owl?

294
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,776
I did not get attacked by an owl.

295
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,978
Robin, listen,
here's what you need to do...

296
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,814
Okay, don't you dare tell me
to steer into the skid, okay?

297
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:35,184
It's too late. I'm already
wrapped around a hydro pole.

298
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,086
It's a Canadian telephone pole.

299
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,722
I never should have
taken this job.

300
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:42,358
Kids, at that moment,
I knew what I had to do

301
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,559
for my friend Robin.

302
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,795
But first I had
to do something for me.

303
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:49,398
Show me "owl attack".

304
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,368
I am freaking out.

305
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,270
Is there a chance
that I can't have kids?

306
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:56,238
I've been hit
in the nuts a lot.

307
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,674
Well, we won't know anything
until we run some tests.

308
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,543
We'll need a sample
of your sperm.

309
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:02,211
No, no, no.

310
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:03,245
There's a room
at the end of the hall.

311
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,480
If you find yourself

312
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,715
inside the elevator,
you've gone too far.

313
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:07,783
You'd think
I wouldn't have to say that,

314
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:08,918
but you'd be surprised.

315
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:15,658
All yours, buddy.

316
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:28,504
The thing you're
about to do in here...

317
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:31,307
I did that in here, too.

318
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,609
Three minutes ago.

319
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:37,513
I was here eight minutes ago.

320
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,448
14 minutes ago.

321
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,785
I'm here every Thursday.

322
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:47,957
I can't do it, Doc.

323
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,391
Is there, like, another option?

324
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,093
Could I...
Could I take this home?

325
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:52,728
Sure, you could, but, uh...

326
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:54,964
we close in an hour
and I'm not back till Tuesday.

327
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,833
So, clock is ticking.
Make it fast.

328
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:00,238
Only way I know how, Doc.

329
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,139
Only way I know how.

330
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:10,112
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

331
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:16,086
Mom. Dad. Uh...

332
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,321
What are you doing here?

333
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:18,722
We hadn't heard from
you in a couple days.

334
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,057
We were worried about you.

335
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,192
For God's sake, son.
Do you have any sixes?

336
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:23,660
Go fish.

337
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:25,996
Excuse me. Hey, Lily,

338
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:28,532
can I just talk to you in here
for a minute? - Oh, yeah.

339
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:31,201
Isn't it great?
They just showed up.

340
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,403
Your mom's already
rearranged my kitchen,

341
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,472
organized my closet...

342
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,374
and she asked me
if I lost height.

343
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,276
Not weight. Height.

344
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,145
Yeah, I'm very excited
that they're here, too.

345
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:44,515
But right now, I have to get
excited about something else.

346
00:13:44,516 --> 00:13:47,584
Oh, okay. Well, I'll go
handle your parents.

347
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:50,287
And you handle your, well...

348
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:53,323
Wait, wait, wait.
Marshall.

349
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:56,293
Thank you, baby.
You're the best.

350
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,565
Marshall. Marshall.

351
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:04,835
I just got my new bathing suit
for the beach this summer.

352
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,271
It's a two-piece.
I mean, can you imagine?

353
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:08,806
Me in a two-piece

354
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,307
bathing suit at my age?

355
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,608
Just picture it!

356
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,310
Picture it!

357
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,878
That's why Fred Cox

358
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,780
is the greatest kicker
the Vikings ever had.

359
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,584
Seriously, Marshall, picture it.

360
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:22,152
Just picture it.

361
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,620
Give me a "C".
Give me an "O".

362
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:24,822
Give me an "X".

363
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,224
What's that spell?
Cox! Cox!

364
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:30,194
Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox!

365
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:32,162
Uh...

366
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,332
Okay, I did
a bad thing last night.

367
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,434
I looked up his address.

368
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:40,037
Who?

369
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:41,872
Sorry. You said "who".

370
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,440
It reminded me
of the owl footage.

371
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:44,608
Genius.

372
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,776
No.

373
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,711
Sandy.
How dare he laugh at you.

374
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,413
Who does he think...

375
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:50,781
Sorry. "Who".

376
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,317
Anyway.

377
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:54,918
I looked up his address
in your contact list.

378
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,887
Oh, God. Tell me
you didn't go over there.

379
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:59,623
I just thought he needed
to listen to common sense

380
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:01,124
and reasonable discourse.

381
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,594
Oh, God. Tell me those aren't
the names of your fists.

382
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:05,295
They're my feet.

383
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,630
I'm actually more of a kicker.

384
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,666
So I went to his apartment.

385
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:15,906
Ah...

386
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:23,881
You're not the pizza guy.

387
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,920
Oh, my God. This is...

388
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,589
This is how you make sure Sandy
never makes fun of you again.

389
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,359
I told you to steer into the skid.
That was bad advice.

390
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,693
So new advice.

391
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:38,896
Steer into Sandy,
and run him down.

392
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,999
If people found out
Sandy wears a toupee...

393
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,301
Really? That's your take-away?

394
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:46,103
Nothing on the bear in the bra?

395
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:47,604
Oh, no.
He's very open about that.

396
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:49,106
That's Gregory.

397
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:50,274
Nice guy.

398
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,410
And the top is so low-cut.

399
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,845
Your father says he has

400
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:57,714
front-row seats
to the Minnesota Twins.

401
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,283
Oh. Oh.

402
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:00,918
By the way, Marshall,

403
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,687
we do need to know if you're
coming to Florida this summer.

404
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:04,855
Are you coming?

405
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:06,156
Marshall?

406
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,859
Marshall, are you coming?

407
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:13,130
This isn't working.

408
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:14,631
Where you going, son?

409
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:16,300
I'm... I'm going to...

410
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:18,869
I'm... I'm going to...

411
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,105
Kids, to this day,
your uncle Marshall is thankful

412
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,707
for what Lily said next.

413
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,908
He's going to masturbate.

414
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,076
Lily!

415
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:28,111
Marshall, just tell them
what's going on.

416
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:32,182
And so Marshall told
his parents everything.

417
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,017
And so, now, I'm just scared

418
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:36,119
that we won't be able
to give you a grandchild.

419
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,388
Aw, Marshall.

420
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:40,857
Hey, we don't care
about that one bit.

421
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,527
And if you guys want kids,

422
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:44,962
there are other ways.

423
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,363
Adoption.

424
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:49,933
Maybe you have a good friend
who could loan you some sperm?

425
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:53,637
Aw, yeah.

426
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,841
Maybe adoption.

427
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,177
What I'm saying is,

428
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:02,612
we love you no matter what.

429
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,883
Now, why don't you pretend
you're in high school,

430
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,785
get back in that bathroom,

431
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:11,321
and "blow dry your hair".

432
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,890
Wait, you knew?

433
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:16,593
We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.

434
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:19,396
So?

435
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:21,898
Possibly last day of work?

436
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,568
Actually, it was a good day.

437
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,069
And I need more numbers

438
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,239
on how the holiday season
impacted the economy.

439
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,409
Sparkles, got anything on malls?

440
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:36,780
Actually, Sandy,

441
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:39,683
I have something I think
you're all gonna want to see.

442
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,453
Yes! Put him in a body bag!

443
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:45,555
Hoo! Hoo! Hyah!

444
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:47,257
- Okay, I didn't do it.
- What?

445
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:49,326
I didn't want to just
viciously attack someone

446
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:50,827
out of the blue
like some kind of...

447
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:52,896
- Owl?
- Exactly.

448
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,198
So, instead of taking your advice,

449
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,800
I took your advice.

450
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:02,973
That day, Robin decided
to steer into the skid.

451
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,443
And though she never quite
shook the nickname,

452
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:09,346
Sparkles went on to do very
well at World Wide News.

453
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:11,581
Especially after this happened.

454
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,289
After his parents
had gone back to Minnesota,

455
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,124
Marshall got
the results of his test.

456
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,127
I'm afraid I have
some very bad news, Marshall.

457
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,865
Judging from the results
of your test, it is...

458
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:31,835
it is very unlikely that you'll
be able to father a child.

459
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:33,970
Oh, God.

460
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:35,305
I know, I know.

461
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,873
It's just...

462
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:37,876
Now...

463
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:41,445
in some rare cases,
a regimen change

464
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:42,712
can fix the problem,

465
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:46,149
so I'm recommending
a spirited cardio routine.

466
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,517
Preferably

467
00:18:47,518 --> 00:18:48,718
with a partner,

468
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:51,221
involving any
light-based firearm activity

469
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:53,390
in the Tri-State area.

470
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:56,193
Poughkeepsie, for example.

471
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:57,994
Have you heard
of the gentlemen's sport

472
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:00,564
known as laser tag?

473
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:02,566
Surprise!

474
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:03,967
Damn it, Barney!

475
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:06,002
What are you doing in here?

476
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:07,571
Think about it, Marshall.

477
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,606
All entrants get 20% off
at the snack bar!

478
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:11,441
Oh, BT-dub,

479
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,676
the receptionist.
What's her situation?

480
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:14,045
Go!

481
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:18,014
Well, Marshall.

482
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,716
I've got your results.

483
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:21,685
And?

484
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:24,754
Your sperm is fine.

485
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,590
My sperm is fine!

486
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:31,261
Count, motility...

487
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:34,131
everything's off the charts.

488
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,534
You, sir, have got
some strong swimmers.

489
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:39,436
Bro, that is awesome.

490
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:41,238
- Motility five!
- Whoa!

491
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,773
Nice.

492
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:45,308
Hey, um, can I
borrow your phone?

493
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,477
- I want to call my dad.
- Yeah, go ahead.

494
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,881
Man, this is great.

495
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,516
I was expecting bad news.

496
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:54,484
I really was.

497
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,801
You're here! Oh, my God!

498
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:14,037
I love you so much!
Can you believe it?

499
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,340
Marshall...

500
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,808
Something's happened. Um...

501
00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:23,046
Your father,
he had a heart attack.

502
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:27,284
He... he didn't make it.

503
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,457
My dad's dead?

504
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,946
I'm not ready for this.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
