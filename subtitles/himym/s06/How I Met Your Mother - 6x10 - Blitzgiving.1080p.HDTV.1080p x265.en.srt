00:00:01,592 --> 00:00:03,474
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:05,385
<i>I was hosting my first Thanksgiving.</i>

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,389
<i>And I wanted it to be unforgettable.</i>

4
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:09,058
Instead of stuffing,

5
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,109
I'm going to fill the turkey with...

6
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:12,747
a slightly smaller turkey.

7
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:15,347
It's called a Turturkeykey!

8
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,365
A Turturkeykey?

9
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:21,671
Yeah, I was there for the "insertion."

10
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:24,522
He used shoehorns.
I'll be having sides.

11
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,360
Your loss.

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,902
It's dead in here.
I'm gonna call it a little early.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,405
No! You can't go now.
It's the night before Thanksgiving.

14
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,139
College chicks are back in town.

15
00:00:34,264 --> 00:00:36,686
Their moms made a snide comment
about the weight they gained.

16
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,162
They called her a bitch,
but deep down, they know she's right.

17
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:42,207
They're about to walk through that door,
where we will be waiting

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,709
with some light beer
and some rock hard approval.

19
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,295
What up?

20
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,882
You don't want to bail early, man.
You could become "The Blitz".

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,983
<i>Blitz was a guy we knew in college.</i>

22
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:55,804
<i>Sadly, he was cursed.</i>

23
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:58,556
Well, I'm calling it a little early.

24
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,850
You sure?
We got big plans.

25
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,117
Remember how last week
we fired up a sandwich,

26
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:06,189
and we listened to Pink Floyd
while watching <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

27
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,148
Tonight,

28
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,720
we're doing the same thing,

29
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:11,350
only with "Weird Al" Yankovic's
<i>Greatest Hits</i>

30
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:13,113
and <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

31
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:14,948
We'll see what happens.

32
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:18,326
Nah, it's "Kraft/Croft night",
mac and cheese and Tomb Raider.

33
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:19,723
Biz-zow!

34
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,491
<i>Every time Blitz left a place,
something amazing happened.</i>

35
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:30,338
I'm sorry.
I thought this was my room.

36
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:34,808
Completely naked!

37
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,094
Completely naked!

38
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,222
And the movie was awesome.

39
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,816
When Brando first appeared,

40
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,103
"Weird Al" launched
right into <i>Eat It.</i>

41
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,967
<i>And over the years,
"The Curse of The Blitz" continued.</i>

42
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:52,944
Well, I'm gonna call it.

43
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,739
I just got Madden 2K1
and I can't stop thinking about it.

44
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,251
See you later!

45
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:58,700
Okay, later!

46
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:05,058
Tap's broke! Can't turn 'em off!

47
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:06,458
Free beer for everyone!

48
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,462
Free beer for everyone!

49
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,963
Free beer for everyone!

50
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,718
You know what?

51
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,830
Go ahead.
Leave early to do something lame.

52
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,806
Just don't blame us
if you become "The Blitz".

53
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:22,891
First of all,

54
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,994
there's nothing lame
about brining a Turturkeykey,

55
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,227
copyright pending.

56
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:28,559
And secondly,

57
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:30,974
I don't believe
"The Curse of The Blitz" is real.

58
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,651
<i>Kids, I'd bet to regret those words.</i>

59
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,557
<i>The "Curse of Blitz" could be passed</i>

60
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,749
<i>from one person to the next,
at any moment.</i>

61
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,045
<i>Blitz had gotten the curse from Jerry
Windheim, back in freshman year,</i>

62
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,500
<i>who got it years before that</i>
<i>from Davey Beaterman.</i>

63
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,211
<i>The original "Blitz", Matt Blitz,</i>

64
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:47,670
<i>was a guy who went to Wesleyan
back in the '60s.</i>

65
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:50,293
<i>He dropped out
right before the school went co-ed.</i>

66
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,295
<i>And then, Thanksgiving morning...</i>

67
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,152
What the hell happened here?

68
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:01,471
Morning, "Blitz"!

69
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:06,643
Let's get one thing straight, okay?
I am not "The Blitz".

70
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,453
<i>My Blitzy lies over the ocean</i>

71
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:14,359
<i>My Blitzy lies over the sea</i>

72
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:18,611
<i>My Blitzy lies over the ocean</i>

73
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:20,532
<i>So bring back my Blitzy...</i>

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,061
Please stop.

75
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,702
Okay, fine.

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,374
<i>to me.</i>

77
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,540
The Gentleman!

78
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,098
The Gentleman!

79
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:31,042
Wait!

80
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,377
What's that?

81
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,115
You had to be there, Blitz.

82
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,991
I'm not "The Blitz"!

83
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,461
Morning, Blitz!

00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,455
For the last two months,
she'd been making my life hell.

91
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,560
Thanks, guys!
Last night was amazing!

92
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:14,836
The Gentleman!

93
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,045
The Gentle...

94
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,850
How could you?

95
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:21,968
My best friends in the world,

96
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,996
hang out with my mortal enemy,

97
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:28,099
then let her sleep in the tub
where I clean myself!

98
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,357
Sorry, Ted. We can explain.

99
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:33,188
- After you Blitzed out last night...
- I'm not "The Blitz"!

100
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:34,665
My God.

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,133
That's Zoey!

102
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:37,859
That's Ted's enemy.

103
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:40,300
Which means she's our enemy.

104
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,947
Let's take this bitch down.

105
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:47,062
Who's got your back?
Now let's have dinner!

106
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,579
Finish the story, Red.

107
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:52,516
Okay, well,
we all started brainstorming

108
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,073
ways to mess with her.

109
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:56,169
There were a lot of different ideas.

110
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,788
And then I'm just
gonna leave her there...

111
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:01,388
butt-naked, covered in candle wax,

112
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:02,813
tied to the bed.

113
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,832
I know that Ted
doesn't like that girl, but,

114
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,515
that's a little extreme.

115
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:11,267
Wait, Ted doesn't like that girl?

116
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,897
I got it.
You see that silk scarf?

117
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,815
I'm gonna steal it.

118
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,822
Can I help you?

119
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,444
My name is Lily Aldrin.

120
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,872
I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's,
so you better...

121
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,166
You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!

122
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,880
You're amazing! I bought
a bunch of your paintings online.

123
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,799
That was you?!

124
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,429
None of us meant
for it to happen, but, well,

125
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,765
we had an awesome night with her.

126
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,536
The Gentleman!

127
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,440
And then,
the craziest thing happened.

128
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,738
I missed a skateboarding dog?

129
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,615
Yeah,
but that wasn't the crazy part.

130
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:08,908
It wasn't?

131
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,453
Truth or dare?

132
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,998
Awesome.
Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths.

133
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,265
So, dare.

134
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,029
I dare you
to send a picture of your junk

135
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,798
to a complete stranger.

136
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:28,144
Best idea ever!

137
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,952
Worst idea ever!

138
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,040
My junk ended up
in some stranger's pocket.

139
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:36,227
If there phone was on vibrate,
I basically dry-humped them.

140
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,480
Everybody shout out random numbers.

141
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,391
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42!

142
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:47,488
And... send!

143
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,783
Wait. Blitz was there, too?

144
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:52,076
The Gentleman!

145
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,872
I was there for the whole thing.

146
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:57,776
Something inside me just said

147
00:06:57,901 --> 00:06:59,751
<i>Grand Theft Auto</i> can wait a night.

148
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,845
It was legen...

149
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,017
Wait for Ted to leave,
cause he's now The Blitz...

150
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,798
... dary. Legendary!

151
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,050
I'm not The Blitz!

152
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,577
I'm afraid you are, Ted.
You see, when you left last night,

153
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:13,002
you changed the course of Blitztory.

154
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,146
<i>Blitz...</i>

155
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,371
I'm finally free!

156
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,516
I mean, you have no idea
what I've missed all these years:

157
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:44,128
The university president's toupee being
snatched by a hawk at graduation,

158
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,048
Zeppelin reuniting
at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah,

159
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,500
countless nip-slips, crotch shots,

160
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,554
shooting stars and double rainbows.
I've missed them all!

161
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,082
Not anymore, Blitz.

162
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,975
My name's not Blitz.

163
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:00,962
My name is Steve!

164
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,881
Colors seem so bright now.

165
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,929
- Thank you, Blitz.
- What?

166
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:15,635
I'm not The Blitz! The only thing
I missed last night was my best friends

167
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,204
stabbing me in the back by
hanging out with my worst enemy.

168
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:19,664
Guys!

169
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,132
I hate Zoey!

170
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:24,335
That means you're supposed to
hate her, too! That's your rule, Lily!

171
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,670
I tried.

172
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,854
Tried?!

173
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:28,929
Lily, do you have any idea

174
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:31,175
how many people
I've blindly hated for you?

175
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,639
I hated Renée Zellweger
with a burning passion

176
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,063
for eight years,

177
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:38,182
only to discover
you meant Reese Witherspoon!

178
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,562
I will hate her until I get my money
back for <i>You, Me and Dupree!</i>

179
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,147
That's Kate Hudson!

180
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,149
Yeah. That's who I hate.

181
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,608
Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.

182
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:49,996
We hate Zoey!

183
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,090
I'm so furious at you all
right now, but,

184
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,783
it's Thanksgiving,
and I have a Turturkeykey to make.

185
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,390
And not that I'm The Blitz,

186
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:02,039
but could everyone please
come with me into the kitchen?

187
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,210
Okay, I'm...

188
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:08,045
just gonna preheat the oven.

189
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,589
The oven.

190
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,333
You should dance on the oven.

191
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:16,837
Make out with Zoey!

192
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,223
Make out with Zoey!

193
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,328
Did they tell you
about the skateboarding dog?

194
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,216
It was awesome!

195
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,794
Great.
So not only did you guys betray me,

196
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,204
but you broke my oven
on Thanksgiving?

197
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,754
Full disclosure.
We also used all your butter,

198
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,043
greasing up Lily so we could see how far
we could slide her down the hall.

199
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,463
But if it helps, I reached 4G.

200
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:55,341
It doesn't help. 4G?

201
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:59,178
What are we supposed to do now?

202
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,640
This is awesome!

203
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,300
I'm part of this!

204
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,979
I don't know if the oven
is deep enough. Plus,

205
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:12,244
it's a display made of cardboard.

206
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,733
I should probably
disconnect the gas.

207
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,155
Just so you guys know,

208
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:20,733
there was a tiny explosion
at the sewage treatment plant

209
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:24,370
across the street from our apartment,
but, I'm sure it's fine by now.

210
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:27,317
- This is awesome!
- It's not awesome!

211
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:29,437
I think the smaller turkey

212
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,045
just tried to crawl further inside
the bigger turkey.

213
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:39,806
I'm have...

214
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,781
I'm having trouble breathing!

215
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,599
Mom keeps
an extra litter box in here.

216
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,895
There you go.
Good as new.

217
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,067
Hey, Ginger.

218
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:59,196
Ted, you're not gonna like this,
but we do have one other option.

219
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,993
Hey, you guys should come
to my house for Thanksgiving.

220
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,038
My husband always spends it with his
daughter, so I'm gonna be alone anyway.

221
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:09,498
Could we bring Ted?

222
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,117
It's Thanksgiving.

223
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,839
What the hell?

224
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,675
Absolutely not.

225
00:11:19,843 --> 00:11:21,468
Come on. Give her a chance.

226
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:25,262
You violated a dead turkey
with another dead turkey.

227
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:26,765
Don't let that be in vain.

228
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,767
Guys? Wait a minute.

229
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,269
Where's Barney?

230
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:34,157
And here's the twist, Babaka.

231
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:38,083
Because Ted left early,
he's now The Blitz!

232
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:41,512
But Barney, now you left the group.

233
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:44,283
Wouldn't that put you in danger
of becoming The Blitz yourself?

234
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:45,591
No. I c...

235
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:47,264
Because...

236
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:49,875
Step on it.

237
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,855
You missed it.

238
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:56,128
Our cab took a wrong turn.

239
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:58,091
We were
in the Thanksgiving Day parade!

240
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:01,091
Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike
and he sang "Twist and Shout!"

241
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,676
But he's The Blitz.

242
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:05,386
I'm not The Blitz.

243
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:07,014
I'm The Bueller.

244
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,457
You know what this means.

245
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:10,851
You're The Blitz.

246
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,348
<i>Blitz...</i>

247
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,597
Life moves pretty fast, Barney.

248
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:23,655
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you might miss it.

249
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:25,733
Chicka-chicka!

250
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:30,579
Happy Thanksgiving!

251
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:38,278
Best friend alert!

252
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,502
The Turturkeykey
is officially cooking.

253
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:46,678
God, that is disgusting!

254
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:48,597
Guys, that's starting to hurt.

255
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,175
Random number guy just
sent me his wang back.

256
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:58,357
You sent a wang out,
and you got a wang back.

257
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,192
- It's a boom-a-wang.
- Nice.

258
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,653
- Thank you.
- No, I meant the wang.

259
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:06,532
- Could you get me some more ice?
- Sure. But...

260
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:08,707
No one move while I'm gone.

261
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:09,882
I'm scared.

262
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:12,477
You're safe.
It's okay to leave the room.

263
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:15,124
You have to leave the building
for something cool to happen.

264
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,417
Thanks.

265
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,779
You're the only one who's
nice to me about this.

266
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,860
I gotta test this.

267
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:31,261
What happened?

268
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,422
You missed it!

269
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,168
Dude, you walked out of the room,

270
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:38,480
the laws of physics stopped
and the laws of awesome tripled.

271
00:13:39,863 --> 00:13:42,192
Man!
You said I could leave the room!

272
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,615
I just wanted
to see something cool happen.

273
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,407
I'm sorry. But I was on that island
for what seems like eternity.

274
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,409
I'm gonna enjoy things
on the other side.

275
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,582
I will pay you to be The Blitz.
$100!

276
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,153
No... $10,000.

277
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,087
No, 60 bucks. That's a lot of money
for someone like you.

278
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,291
Dude, The Blitz isn't something
that can be bought or sold.

279
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,134
Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.

280
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:08,469
What was that?

281
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:11,930
I was distracted by the 4-caret diamond
your 53-year-old husband bought you.

282
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:13,140
Facial!

283
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:16,246
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a turturkeykey to baste.

284
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:17,871
I'm coming with you.

285
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,605
I baste alone.

286
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:21,315
I'm sure you're a master baster.

287
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,033
Word play. Loving it.

288
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,779
But relax. I've got a ton of sides
to heat up since my plans fell through.

289
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:28,447
Who canceled? Your coven?

290
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,908
Coven. Group of witches. Boom.

291
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,535
They were worn out from
putting that spell on your hair.

292
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,120
Serve returned.

293
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,748
Are you happy?
You're ruining Thanksgiving.

294
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,751
You're not exactly who I thought I'd be
spending Thanksgiving with, either.

295
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,087
God, I'm so happy to be here.

296
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,298
My face hurts from smiling.

297
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:49,635
I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just
never gonna like that woman.

298
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,429
- Ted, give her a chance.
- Enemies can't become friends.

299
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:53,722
Yes, they can.

300
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,990
Right, guys?

301
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,478
You guys can't be objective.
You still feel guilty about last night.

302
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,110
Let's get an outside opinion.

303
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,357
- Who are we gonna...
- "Dear Wang Guy..."

304
00:15:03,996 --> 00:15:07,819
"Can enemies ever be friends?
Just wondering."

305
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:12,032
Really? Wang Guy?
We're asking Wang Guy?

306
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,033
He's bold and uninhibited,
so why not?

307
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:18,387
And guys, you know what? For fun,
why don't we ask him

308
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:19,998
what he does for a living?

309
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:21,885
Wouldn't that be fun?

310
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,255
You've got a little crush
on Wang Guy, don't you?

311
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:27,972
What? No.

312
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:30,092
Shut up. I hate him.

313
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,560
Look.
We got an answer. Here it is.

314
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,935
"Yes, enemies can become friends.

315
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,515
"Remember what Gandhi said.

316
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,353
'Be the change you want
to see in the world.'"

317
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,022
Did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?

318
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,732
That is amazing.

319
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,252
And I was here for it.

320
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,179
Now Zoey is The Blitz.

321
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:52,573
Burn on her.

322
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,183
Come on, man.

323
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,910
Don't be that Blitz.

324
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:59,788
I'm not any Blitz!
You're The Blitz!

325
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:01,498
You're all The Blitz!

326
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,501
I slept with that cute
Indian girl who cuts my hair!

327
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:06,336
What does that have to do
with anything?

328
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:09,230
Nothing! I just forgot
to brag about it before!

329
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,938
Guys, despite the wit
and wisdom of Wang Guy,

330
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:15,012
Zoey and I
are never going to be friends.

331
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:18,084
We're just here for her oven
and that's it.

332
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,562
- Did you do that on purpose?
- What? No. It was an accident.

333
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,272
Yeah. Well, like this is.

334
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:27,774
- Great. Real mature.
- Yeah, well, you started it.

335
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,617
Just stop it!

336
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,573
Can't you two just
stop fighting for one day?

337
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:37,823
Like, when the Roadrunner
and the Coyote

338
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:39,703
clocked out and had a beer together?

339
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:42,748
Or Tom and Jerry
shared a cup of coffee.

340
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:46,460
Those are cartoon characters, and I'm
pretty sure you're making up episodes.

341
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,381
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!

342
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,718
Get out.
All of you, out!

343
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:56,303
But it's Thanksgiving.

344
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,021
And I'm a part of it.

345
00:16:58,348 --> 00:16:59,348
Out!

346
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,521
Wait...

347
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:04,978
Where's Barney?

348
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:08,023
Guys, the most amazing thing
just happened to me in that other roo...

349
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:12,596
Man.

350
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,324
I don't get it.

351
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:19,892
Why'd she just
kick us out like that?

352
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:23,706
<i>And then the cab driver said
the last thing any of us wanted to hear.</i>

353
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:24,831
Where to?

354
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,836
I guess we're going home.

355
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,717
Yeah. I don't know where that is.

356
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:47,908
Lily, where'd you get that?

357
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,360
When Zoey booted us, it made me
wanna steal something of hers again.

358
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,450
Apartment full of designer labels,
and what do I grab?

359
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,583
"Happy Turkey Day, Hannah.
Love, Zoey."

360
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:03,245
I wonder who Hannah is.

361
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,751
You guys should come
to my house for Thanksgiving.

362
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:13,630
My husband always spends it with his
daughter, so I'm gonna be alone, anyway.

363
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:16,717
You're not exactly who I thought I'd be
spending Thanksgiving with, either.

364
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:20,846
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!

365
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,182
Get out!
All of you, out!

366
00:18:27,182 --> 00:18:28,645
We have to go back to Zoey's.

367
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:33,310
You gotta throw me
some addresses, buddy.

368
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:40,157
What are you doing here?

369
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,450
Barney let us in.

370
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,786
Barney was here?
I was walking around half-naked.

371
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:46,892
Man!

372
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,790
Wait. Which half?

373
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,794
I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't wanna
spend Thanksgiving with you.

374
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,421
How do you know that?

375
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:55,589
I just do.

376
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:57,382
It must be tough.

377
00:18:58,914 --> 00:19:01,450
It was the first Thanksgiving
Hannah agreed to spend with me,

378
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:04,464
and then at the last minute,
she changed her mind.

379
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,225
She hates my guts.

380
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:10,479
I get that.

381
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,193
You should hang on to this.
You can give it to her next year.

382
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:20,419
Right.

383
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,106
Next year.

384
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:25,660
You never know.
People don't stay enemies forever.

385
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:30,123
<i>And that's the story of how
Zoey and I became friends.</i>

386
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,791
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

387
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:36,463
Before we eat, we should take
a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.

388
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,381
- Great idea.
- All right.

389
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:41,768
Here we go.

390
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,692
One, two, three.

391
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:49,771
That is the best-looking turturkeykey
I have ever seen.

392
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:53,877
Thank you. Let's just hope
it tastes as good as it looks.

393
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,002
<i>It didn't.</i>

394
00:19:55,218 --> 00:19:56,518
<i>It tasted wrong.</i>

395
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,685
We forgot to light the candles.

396
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,823
<i>And just as Barney looked away,</i>

397
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:04,091
<i>it happened.</i>

398
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:35,063
The Gentleman!

399
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,524
What happened?
I saw it!

400
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:41,069
Come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad.

401
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:42,453
Man.

402
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,408
Go ahead.
I forgot my jacket.

403
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:52,705
Hold the door!

404
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,421
Thank you, God!

405
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:02,011
Man!

406
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,378
<i>Blitz.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
