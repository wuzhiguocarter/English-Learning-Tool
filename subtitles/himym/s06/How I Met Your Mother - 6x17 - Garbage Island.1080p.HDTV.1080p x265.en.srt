1
00:00:02,553 --> 00:00:05,971
<i>Kids, sometimes wonderful things
come out of horrible situations.</i>

2
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:09,350
<i>Remember that trip I took to Hong Kong
where I got stuck in the airport?</i>

3
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,381
<i>Well, a funny thing
happened that day.</i>

4
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:13,471
Yes, I realize it's raining,

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,209
but, come on, it's 2021.

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:17,440
We can make cell phones
that project holograms,

7
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,738
but a light drizzle shuts
down a whole airport?

8
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,418
There she is.

9
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,647
- Wendy the Waitress.
- Wendy the Waitress!

10
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:31,989
I was just saying...
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:34,040
<i>What was she doing there?</i>

12
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,160
<i>For that, we have to back
up about ten years.</i>

13
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:37,662
So, Barney,

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,961
I hear you and Nora
had a fun time at laser tag.

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,746
I don't know where you heard that.
It was a disaster.

16
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,085
Not according to her.

17
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:46,671
My God, this was so much fun.

18
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,013
- We have to do this again.
- We do, we have to.

19
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:52,510
- Wanna grab a drink right now?
- No, I'm kind of tired, but...

20
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,637
This is my number, give me a call.

21
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,013
Absolutely.

22
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:00,342
- How is that a disaster?
- She didn't want to get drinks.

23
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:03,187
And as soon as a girl says
she doesn't want to get drinks, well...

24
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,148
- Wanna grab a drink right now?
- No, I'm kind of tired.

25
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:12,868
Absolutely.

26
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:15,205
It's a shame, too.

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,500
She was a really great
laser tag partner.

28
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,578
She's tiny,
so she's allowed to push kids.

29
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,551
Please, Cheese. You like this girl.

30
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,928
What? Nora?
No, I don't.

31
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,953
Barney, you can't say her
name without smiling.

32
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,182
Sorry, sorry.

33
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,962
I was thinking of a funny thing
that Nora said.

34
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:38,087
Stop it.

35
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,935
- Damn it, what is the matter with me?
- You like her.

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,058
- You should call her.
- Call her?

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,762
Three things...
She had a nice face,

38
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:50,985
her booty was in place,
but Barney don't chase.

39
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,603
That is ridiculous.

40
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:55,018
Barney, you know what,
here's some advice.

41
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,247
Totally.

6x17 - Garbage Island (1.00)
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

46
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,889
<i>Kids,
I had just started dating Zoey.</i>

47
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,684
<i>And when you first start dating someone,
everyone wants to know the same thing.</i>

48
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,210
How did we meet?

49
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,889
- She doesn't want...
- No, it's a cute story.

50
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,315
Once upon a time...

51
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:33,898
<i>Zoey was married to this super rich,
super creepy guy, called The Captain.</i>

52
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:38,135
<i>So when Zoey and I became friends,
I was careful not to cross any lines.</i>

53
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:40,743
This movie is scary.

54
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,111
I know, right?

55
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:46,812
<i>But then one day,
Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight.</i>

56
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:49,337
<i>He flipped out
and demanded a divorce.</i>

57
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:51,933
<i>And she was heartbroken.</i>

58
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,728
<i>But after a little soul-searching,</i>

59
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:57,343
<i>she ended up back in my life,
and the rest, as they say,</i>

60
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,058
is history.

61
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,181
Actually, I said, "How's your meat?"

62
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:05,643
A little cold.

63
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,811
Gee, wonder why.

64
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:13,587
Did you have a chance to pick up
that box I left at my old apartment?

65
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,479
I don't want to see The Captain.

66
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:19,846
I mean this in a super manly way.

67
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:21,617
That guy scares the panties off me.

68
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,954
You don't have to.
The box's with the doorman.

69
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,665
If it's really important to you,
I will pick it up tomorrow.

70
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,084
All right, guys,
I have to go. I have

71
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,335
a big meaningless stack of paperwork
that I have to get off my desk

72
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,048
to make room for tomorrow's big
meaningless stack of paperwork.

73
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,630
But it's all worth it,
you know, 'cause,

74
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,885
at least I know
I'm making the world a...

75
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:44,223
place.
All right, see you guys later.

76
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,717
I'm worried about Marshall.
He doesn't seem like himself lately.

77
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:51,063
He's been really quiet.

78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,489
Well, that's just what
Minnesota guys are like...

79
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:55,595
Strong, silent, you know, man's man.

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,819
Like Prince.

81
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,237
No, it's more than that. It's like,

82
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,619
all the stuff he used to love, he...

83
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:04,044
suddenly has no interest in anymore.

84
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:09,206
Excuse me?

85
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:11,575
In my travels,

86
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,704
I've developed a finely calibrated sense
of how long it's been since...

87
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,133
How do I not put this delicately?
A girl's been porked.

88
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,554
You've been pork-free so long,
you're practically kosher.

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,598
It's been a while.

90
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,392
Five weeks,
three days by my estimation.

91
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,686
You should work at a carnival.

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,564
I tried. They're pretty strict
with backgrounds.

93
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:36,609
- Anyway, we should get going.
- I'll walk out with you guys.

94
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,944
- Good night.
- Good night, guys.

95
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,496
18 weeks.

96
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,664
Damn it.

97
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,792
Okay, yes,
I am in a bit of a dry spell.

98
00:04:58,202 --> 00:04:59,954
Child, listen.

99
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,801
If you're really hurting for it,

100
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:05,262
I'd be more than happy
to throw you one.

101
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:07,556
Throw me one? Yeah.

102
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,573
We're exes. We're probably
due for a backslide.

103
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:13,187
Or we could just do it
the normal way.

104
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,058
I see what's going on.

105
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,608
This is about Nora.

106
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,147
You met a girl, you liked her,

107
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:24,119
but then you missed your shot.
And now you're trying to

108
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:27,243
hook up with your ex-girlfriend to
prove to yourself that you don't care.

109
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,455
You could not be more...
What do you mean I missed my shot?

110
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,473
- Nora met a guy.
- What?!

111
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,876
What?

112
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,380
Off the market. He's taking her
to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.

113
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,882
But "L'Amour" means love!
They're going to the cafe of love!

114
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,510
I'm fine. It's fine.
Point is,

115
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,616
Robin, I don't even like Nora.

116
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,223
Damn it!

117
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,812
Why aren't you in bed?

118
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:56,605
I can't sleep.

119
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:01,305
Anything I can do
to help you with that?

120
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:05,503
Maybe after
this documentary on garbage.

121
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,436
Man, I am losing my touch.

122
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,620
<i>Nearly twice the size of Texas,</i>

123
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,472
<i>the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch,
or "Garbage Island,"</i>

124
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:16,417
<i>is an environmental catastrophy.</i>

125
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:18,919
<i>Lost in a sea of vomish,</i>

126
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,342
<i>this young bird
stwuggles not to drown,</i>

127
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:24,299
<i>stwangling in the plastic rings
of a six-pack.</i>

128
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,012
<i>Marshall Eriksen, I think you know
what you have to do.</i>

129
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,185
- I have to save the planet!
- Is it over? I call on top.

130
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,562
<i>A few days later, I headed over to The
Captain's building to get Zoey's box.</i>

131
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,930
I'm here to...

132
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:40,063
What a surprise.

133
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,934
You've come to rescue me from
the capsized wreckage of my marriage.

134
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,541
I hesitated calling you because
I know you and Zoey were friendly.

135
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,795
But my wife has left me.
All my friends have abandoned me.

136
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,624
Please, tell me you're on my side.

137
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:12,222
Let's adjourn to the study.

138
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:16,560
Garbage Island.

139
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,897
You haven't heard of Garbage Island?

140
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,124
It's an island...

141
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:23,933
made of garbage!

142
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,780
It's in the Pacific Ocean.
It's twice the size of Texas!

143
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,098
In other words,
one-eighth the size of Canada. So...

144
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:35,619
Guys, I'm going environmental, okay?

145
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:37,281
Phase one: the bar.

146
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:40,250
I've already convinced MacLaren's
to implement a new green initiative.

147
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,460
That's 'cause of you?

148
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,006
I gotta carry an 80-pound bag of bottles
to the recycling center every night.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,092
I threw my back out.

150
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,625
You're welcome... Earth.

151
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,198
Phase two: GNB.

152
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:57,040
Tomorrow I'm going to make
a presentation in front of the board

153
00:07:57,165 --> 00:08:01,056
about how we can cut our carbon
footprint by half for only $12 million.

154
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,648
Dude, don't do that.

155
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,819
All they're gonna hear is "$12 million,"
and all you're gonna hear

156
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,153
is the sound of the door
smacking your fired ass.

157
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,990
And some muffled laughter.
Which I apologize for in advance.

158
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,410
Guys, I got a problem.

159
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,662
I ran into The Captain.

160
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:19,998
Beneath this

161
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:24,294
lustrous mane,
I wear the horns of a cuckold.

162
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,589
Zoey left me for another man.

163
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,636
Do you have any idea
who it could be?

164
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,004
<i>The Captain then told a story much
different than the one I'd been telling.</i>

165
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,979
<i>But one maybe just as true.</i>

166
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:41,228
Once upon a time,
Zoey and I were happy.

167
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:43,943
<i>Blissful as Arcadian shepherds.</i>

168
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:47,044
<i>I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite.</i>

169
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,071
<i>I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis
could not have torn us asunder.</i>

170
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:54,450
We had great big boners
for each other.

171
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,162
But then...
enter the scoundrel.

172
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,790
This movie's scary.

173
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,958
I know.

174
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,422
<i>I don't know what he looks like,
but I picture him with a mustache.</i>

175
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,175
Limit the search to guys
with mustaches. Smart.

176
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,595
Anyway,
soon the inevitable happened.

177
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,556
<i>She told me
she was in love with someone else.</i>

178
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,641
<i>Obviously, it made me angry.</i>

179
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,296
And that's the last time
you saw her.

180
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,104
But I gathered my composure,

181
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,064
<i>and told her
I'd do anything to keep her.</i>

182
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,774
<i>I begged her not to leave.</i>

183
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,518
<i>We made love that night.</i>

184
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,572
That's damn good brandy.

185
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,090
But morning came,

186
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:37,271
and she was gone.

187
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,830
Don't blame yourself.

188
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,916
I don't blame myself.

189
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:48,143
There's only one man
I blame for this.

190
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,588
Me.

191
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,673
I'm the bad guy.

192
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,834
Maybe to him you are,

193
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,909
but in the story
of picking up the box for Zoey,

194
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,472
you're the hero.

195
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:00,140
Damn it! The box!

196
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:18,197
How about this:

197
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,369
from now until tomorrow afternoon,

198
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:24,039
I do this, and then tomorrow night,

199
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:25,909
I do that.

200
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:26,875
Deal.

201
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,460
Come on.

202
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:38,762
You lying little minx.

203
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,532
I happened to be
at <i>Cafe L'Amour</i> tonight

204
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:44,694
from 5:00 pm until closing,

205
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,840
reading a newspaper
with two holes cut out of it,

206
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,127
and I never saw Nora

207
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,274
or this Italian race car driver
she's dating.

208
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,109
Sorry.
Who said anything about an...

209
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,278
You just know
he's an Italian race car driver.

210
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,510
No, he's not.
He doesn't exist.

211
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,116
I made the whole thing up
to see if you like her. And you do.

212
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,535
So you should just call her.

213
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:04,162
Here is her number.

214
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,795
I also programmed your phone
while you were in the bathroom.

215
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,969
That was a joke.
You just got here, remember?

216
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,472
You really are smitten.

217
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,661
I'm not.

218
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:25,234
I'm Barney Stinson.

219
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,644
I don't get smitten, I smite!

220
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,284
You are totally smitten,

221
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:31,315
but you're scared
of being in a relationship.

222
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,316
I'm not.

223
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,735
I can't be anyone's
boyfriend, Robin.

224
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,021
If I got serious with Nora,
it would be like if

225
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:40,699
Mother Teresa focused all her attention
on one really hot orphan.

226
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,582
With great penis
comes great responsibility.

227
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,764
Okay, Mother Teresa,

228
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:49,916
throw me one.

229
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,944
- Sorry?
- I'd like it if you threw me one.

230
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:54,918
Fastball, right down the middle.

231
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,967
Actually, if I recall correctly,
a slight curve.

232
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,761
Careful, Robin, I'll do it.

233
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:04,222
I don't think so. You don't want
to screw things up with Nora.

234
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,513
Prove me wrong.
Tomorrow night, my place.

235
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,568
Don't poke the dragon, Robin,

236
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:11,993
cause the dragon will poke you back.

237
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:19,307
Sex now,
we'll do the foreplay after.

238
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:22,908
It didn't go so well.

239
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:26,578
The green initiative,
for only $12 million, will change...

240
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,197
I've heard enough.

241
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,751
Don't we already have
a green initiative?

242
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,822
I mean, didn't we do a whole thing?

243
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:35,350
Hang a banner, make a video,
Sting was there.

244
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,481
- I thought I met Sting.
- You did meet Sting.

245
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:38,449
I met Sting.

246
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:41,558
So why on Earth would we spend
another $12 million?

247
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,387
Because we can always do more.

248
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,389
Yeah, but I met Sting.

249
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,266
Meeting Sting
isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!

250
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,728
Who here supports
Eriksen's proposal?

251
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:57,234
- He has some good points.
- Meeker, you're fired!

252
00:12:57,531 --> 00:12:59,849
- And as for you, Eriksen...
- His father just died.

253
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:03,907
Nice presentation.
We'll keep it under advisement.

254
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,392
Meeker got fired because of me.
I'm the bad guy.

255
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:09,631
No, sweetie.

256
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,248
Just put all that
out of your mind and relax.

257
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:17,385
I got you a six-pack
of tall boys from the deli.

258
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:31,268
What happened to the plastic rings
that held the six-pack together?

259
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,426
I don't know.
I threw them down the garbage chute.

260
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,064
Let's just use the handcuffs.

261
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,055
Baby, birds can get caught in those

262
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,670
then they dwown in wubbish!

263
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:43,739
Weren't you listening?
Don't you care about Garbage Island?

264
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,533
Right now, I don't give a wat's ass
about Garbage Island.

265
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:47,957
I do.

266
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,709
I got to find those rings!

267
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,107
Cwap.

268
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:57,294
- Hi, I'm here to pick up...
- Hello, Ted.

269
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:01,371
- To the study?
- To the study!

270
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:04,885


271
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:08,477
I know.

272
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:10,817
What?

273
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,559
I know who stole my Zoey.

274
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,120
No man likes to be betrayed,

275
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,253
especially by a friend.

276
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:18,784
You can imagine then

277
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:21,301
how painful it was
when I learned that the name

278
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:22,778
of my betrayer is...

279
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,375
Ted...

280
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:28,644
when I tell you who it is,
you're gonna...

281
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:32,954
It's my doorman!

282
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:36,666
That son of a bitch!

283
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:44,195
You think Zoey's sleeping
with the doorman?

284
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,662
He always winks and tips his hat
when he sees her.

285
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,179
I know how these things work.

286
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,349
He holds her package,
and pretty soon, she's holding his.

287
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:55,431
And then there's
his glorious mustache.

288
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,420
I will have him fired for this!

289
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,241
You can't fire him.

290
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:00,959
You're right.

291
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,737
Maritime protocol
demands physical retribution!

292
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,772


293
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:08,696
No physical retribution!
Stop!

294
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,221
Who is this flower child,

295
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,013
and what has he done
with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?

296
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,704
Look, yes,

297
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,457
the doorman is a scoundrel.

298
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:18,438
The mustache alone gives that away.

299
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,275
He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!

300
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,788
"Rapscallion" may be going
a bit far.

301
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,614
But it's not his fault.

302
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:27,217
It's nobody's fault.

303
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,847
You and Zoey have nothing in common.

304
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,013
For God's sake, Captain,
she hates boats!

305
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,474
You're just
not right for each other.

306
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,179
It's tough to face, but I'm sure

307
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,563
a small part of you
has always known that.

308
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:46,529
Why couldn't she just like boats?

309
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,612
Just to have one thing in common?

310
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,671
Other girls like boats, don't they?

311
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,653
Of course they do.

312
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,399
And you'll find one.

313
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,200
And you'll be much happier with her
than you ever were with Zoey.

314
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:06,090
When you put it that way,
I should almost thank the doorman.

315
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,452
And, you know, since,

316
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,996
since it doesn't really matter
who Zoey's dating now...

317
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,351
- It really doesn't.
- It doesn't.

318
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:20,479
It's me.
You're welcome.

319
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,106
Baby, what gives?

320
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,555
I'm sorry, but neither of us
are getting any action

321
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,245
until I find those rings.

322
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:39,748
I hope
this doesn't make me look desperate.

323
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:46,088
All right, Robin, give it to me.

324
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,984
Damn it, Barney, you failed my test!

325
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,735
You know, I try to root for you.

326
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:53,716
Even as your ex-girlfriend,
when you meet someone, I'm like:

327
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,570
"Yeah, Barney, go get her!"

328
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:57,858
But you know what?
Just forget it.

329
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:00,102
You'll never change.
I'm done trying to help you.

330
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:02,605
The number.

331
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,628
Give me the number,
'cause I really can't tell...

332
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,155
Is that a seven or a nine?

333
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,448
It's a five, idiot.

334
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:15,784
A fi...? In what moon man language
is that a five?

335
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,786
What does that even mean?

336
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:21,352
- How can I see that's a five?
- Look how you taped this up...

337
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,844
I have a phone call to make.

338
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,298
Go get her.

339
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,864
I need to ask you something.

340
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:38,223
Did I steal you?

341
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,854
You did.
By being the kind of sweet,

342
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:49,699
thoughtful guy who'd never even think
of stealing someone, you stole me.

343
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,658
So I'm the bad guy.

344
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,957
Great.

345
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,668
Well, the story isn't over, Ted.

346
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:59,745
It'll be years before we know
who's the good guy, who's the bad guy.

347
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:01,538
I mean, yes,

348
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:03,970
divorce sucks, but...

349
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:09,505
sometimes things need to fall apart
to make way for better things.

350
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:12,469
If you say so.

351
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:15,696
I'm just saying,
the eggs are already broken.

352
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,138
Let's make sure
we get a pretty good omelet out of it.

353
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,969
Seriously, what's going on?

354
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,191
He'll never get to see
how I turn out.

355
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,435
What do you mean?

356
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:33,956
My dad. You know, I used to...

357
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:37,101
I used to always tell him
that I'll  be an environmental lawyer.

358
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:38,951
And he was always so proud.

359
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,428
But he never got to see
the me that was anything but...

360
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,040
a corporate stooge.

361
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:46,834
Now it's too late.

362
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:50,212
And we're starting a family,
you know.

363
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:54,758
Are you avoiding sleeping with me
'cause you don't want to start a family?

364
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,785
Lily, if we have a baby right now,

365
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,974
that is just it for me.

366
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:07,394
The cement will dry,
and I will be stuck at GNB forever.

367
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,723
If you want to quit your job
and go work for the NRDC right now,

368
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,071
then you need to do that right now.

369
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:21,381
And then, once you've cleaned up
all the oceans and saved the planet,

370
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,583
you know, like, a year from now,

371
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,914
then we'll start a family.

372
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,898
I don't know.

373
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,518
So far, in the name
of saving the planet,

374
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:34,339
I've ruined your night,
I practically broke Wendy's back.

375
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,593
And I got Meeker fired.
The guy must hate me.

376
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:39,386
Meeker doesn't hate you.

377
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,430
<i>Meeker hated him, all right.</i>

378
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:44,334
<i>After all, Marshall was the one
who got him fired.</i>

379
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,518
<i>Meeker knew
we all hung out at MacLaren's.</i>

380
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,771
<i>So that night,
he went there to confront Marshall.</i>

381
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,485
<i>But as luck would have it...</i>

382
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,862
- Are you guys...
- Closed. Sorry.

383
00:19:58,749 --> 00:19:59,849
Rough night?

384
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:02,242
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,863
It's not your fault.

386
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,957
It's no one's fault.
Except for Marshall Eriksen.

387
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:08,791
What did you say?

388
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:13,754
I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault.
Why, do you know him?

389
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,465
Know him?
I hate that guy.

390
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:18,133
Me, too.

391
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:23,015
<i>And the rest, as they say...</i>

392
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,111
is history.

393
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:29,144
And three kids later, we decided
to come here on our second honeymoon.

394
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:32,898
That's a pretty good omelet.

395
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,818
What about you?
You still with Zoey?

396
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,488
That did not end well.

397
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,117
But it's all for the best,

398
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:43,645
'cause I'm married to an amazing girl,
we have two kids.

399
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:46,161
It's actually a funny story
of how we met.

400
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,789
I was a best man at this wedding...

401
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,791
It's great seeing you, but we got to run.

402
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:54,773
Have a safe trip.
It was great seeing you.

403
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,936
You will not believe
who I just ran into.

9999
