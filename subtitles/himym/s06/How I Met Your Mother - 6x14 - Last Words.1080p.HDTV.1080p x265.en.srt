<i>Kids, when your best friend
loses someone...</i>

00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:18,517
My dad's dead?

This is the toughest time
in Marshall's life

11
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:29,814
and I feel absolutely useless.

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,322
What can we do to help?

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,511
Don't look at me.
This morning, Marshall said,

14
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:36,441
"I have to pee." And I said,
"Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you."

15
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,580
Halfway through the pee, I'm, like,
"This doesn't even make sense!"

16
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,827
Well, I've been to a couple funerals,
so I know my role.

17
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:44,087
I'm Vice Girl.

18
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:47,463
Whatever Marshall needs to get
through this day, I got it right here.

19
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,803
Cigarettes, alcohol...
Are these firecrackers?

20
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,180
My God, Robin, you somehow

21
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,502
crammed Tijuana into a purse.

22
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,209
Be cool, nerds!

23
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,401
Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept
or sat down since we got here.

24
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,326
Wait!

25
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:12,196
That can be my role!
I'll take care of Judy!

26
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,634
But doesn't Marshall's mom hate you...
The fact that you two aren't very close?

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,809
Sweet save.

28
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:21,669
Judy and I aren't besties,
but today, whatever she needs,

29
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:23,416
I'm there.
I'm on Judy duty.

30
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,252
- "Judy duty."
- She said "doody."

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,295
Really, guys? At a funeral?

32
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,370
Well, not all of us possess
your lofty sense of decorum,

33
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:34,385
Drug-Dealer-From
An-'80s-After-School-Special,

34
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:37,638
- we have to laugh today. It's healthy.
- Wait a minute!

35
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:38,973
Today,

36
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,934
- we are gonna make Marshall laugh.
- How?

37
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,895
What's the one thing
that always cracks him up?

38
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,873
Internet footage
of a guy getting hit in the nuts.

39
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:48,998
Exactly!

40
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:52,218
So we are gonna get our bro
a four-star nad rattler.

41
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:55,845
You search knees, feet, banisters,
fire hydrants and diving boards,

42
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,076
and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey
sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.

43
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,694
What about animals?

44
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:04,282
Claws, paws, talons,
hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists.

45
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:05,657
We can do this!

46
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:09,110
Guys, sorry...
I left my charger back in New York,

47
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:11,672
- so my phone's out of juice.
- Outlet or USB?

48
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,216
Outlet. Thank you.

49
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:19,513
You really do have
everything in there, don't you?

50
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,391
You're like Mary Poppins,
if her purse was filled with drugs.

51
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,559
"If"?

52
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:26,582
The kids in that movie
jumped into a painting

53
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:29,564
and spent 15 minutes
chasing a cartoon fox.

54
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,339
"Spoonful of sugar..."?

55
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,693
Grow up.

56
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:37,823
- I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.
- Thank you, Reverend.

57
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,535
We're so happy that you're going
to lead the services today.

58
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,550
Unfortunately, I can't.

59
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:46,874
My daughter in Chicago
just went into labor.

60
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,404
But I'm leaving you in the capable hands
of my second-in-command:

61
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,380
- my son.
- Your son?

62
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,675
You remember Trey.
I'll go grab him.

63
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:00,397
Guys...

64
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:01,973
Trey Platt

65
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,626
terrorized me growing up.
He was the toughest bully in school.

66
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:06,936
'Sup Marshall.

67
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,773
Long time.

68
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,486
I was not aware
that you had become a reverend.

69
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,655
Yeah, well, your lunch
money finally ran out.

70
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,573
Kidding!

71
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,828
You could use a laugh.

72
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,146
This video is entitled, "Little League
Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts

73
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,430
by a Foul Ball and
Then Vomits in a Garbage Can."

74
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,873
I don't wanna give anything away.
Let's just watch.

75
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,644
- See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...
- ... right in the nuts,

76
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,069
The fat kid just keeps run away.

77
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,044
I can't believe my father's
funeral service is being led by

78
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,440
Trey "The Noogie Machine" Platt.

79
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,070
That guy gave you noogies?

80
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,735
What, did he carry a stepladder?

81
00:03:57,955 --> 00:03:59,113
He made me carry it.

82
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,616
So, my dad has these questions
to help create

83
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,661
a theme for the service,
or whatever.

84
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,538
Question 1,

85
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:10,417
"What were your last
words with the deceased?"

86
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,542
Lame.

87
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,567
- Question 2...
- Wait...

88
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,842
My last words with Marvin
were lovely.

89
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:19,967
I've been thinking about them a lot.

90
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,135
Me, too.

91
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,346
We went for a hike in the snow
and had this amazing talk.

92
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,681
My last day with Pop,

93
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,725
he taught my son how to skate.

94
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,609
This is clearly yielding nothing.

95
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:36,456
Thanks, Dad. Guess I'll have
to fill the time with some jokes...

96
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,581
again.

97
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,994
"Last words"
seems like a good theme.

98
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,826
Marshall, do you remember
the last thing your father said to you?

99
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,750
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.

100
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,999
Son,

101
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,669
there's something
I wanna say before I leave.

102
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:03,135
Could I snag that extra pork chop
for the flight?

103
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,305
I was gonna make
a sandwich with that, Dad.

104
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,349
Don't they have food on the plane?

105
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,101
Yeah, but plane food is ass.

106
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:15,230
"Plane food is ass."

107
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:19,954
Those are the last words
my father will ever say to me.

108
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,446
Right after
I denied the man a pork chop.

109
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,788
Wait!
I'm wrong!

110
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,752
I'm wrong! That wasn't it!

111
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:34,375
They couldn't find a cab...

112
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:37,513
<i>So my dad called up from the street.</i>

113
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,388
Looks like rain out here!

114
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:44,416
I couldn't find an umbrella
in your closet!

115
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:48,237
You know
who probably has an umbrella?

116
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,773
<i>And then, well,</i>

117
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:52,910
<i>see, my dad grew up in a small town,
in another generation,</i>

118
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:55,377
<i>so sometimes,
totally well-meaningly,</i>

119
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:56,832
<i>he'd say stuff like...</i>

120
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,816
The Koreans across the hall!

121
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,237
The Koreans are a trustworthy
and generous people!

122
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,045
I betcha one of the Koreans
has an umbrella!

123
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:09,124
Heck, they're Koreans!

124
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,808
My dad's last words to me
were a string of...

125
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:17,292
odd racial stereotypes.

126
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,571
All that stuff was really nice!

127
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:21,505
It's positive racism!

128
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,425
This is worse than the pork chop.

129
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,589
This next clip is entitled,

130
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:31,514
"Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit
in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull"

131
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,100
Let's see what happens.

132
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:37,454
Here he comes...

133
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:44,194
- 'Cause he gets hit...
- Right in the nuts.

134
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:48,007
And then the fat kid
loses his swim shorts.

135
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:50,075
- Shorts just fall right off.
- No, wait.

136
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,813
I'm wrong.
That wasn't it.

137
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,121
They couldn't find a cab,
so I went down there.

138
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:59,543
You were right. The Kangs did,
in fact, have an umbrella.

139
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,296
- Of course they did.
- Bye, sweetie.

140
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:06,738
Hey, son...

141
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,803
I just wanna leave you
with a little advice.

142
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,976
Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee III.</i>

143
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,979
I caught it on the cable last night.
It totally holds up!

144
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:25,948
<i>Crocodile Dundee III</i>
is the second-best of the Croc trilogy,

145
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:27,905
so maybe I can live with that.

146
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,848
Sorry, my phone's charged.

147
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,662
I hear you're a woman
who can get things.

148
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,707
I've been known to locate
certain objects from time to time.

149
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:41,710
I need vodka
and dirty playing cards.

150
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,129
I got ya.

151
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,511
What is it?

152
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,666
I have a voice mail from my dad.

153
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,564
You have a voice mail from your dad?

154
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,524
How?

155
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,734
My phone's been out of juice,

156
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:08,459
so he must've called me
the day the he...

157
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,557
Baby, are you okay?

158
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,343
I hold in my hand

159
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:18,001
the last words
my father will ever say to me.

160
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,459
I'm gonna hit play.

161
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,505
What's wrong?

162
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:29,550
What if it's worse
than <i>Crocodile Dundee III?</i>

163
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,819
I can't do this. I can't...

164
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:36,565
My mom is about to collapse...

165
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,974
Wait... No, baby...
Baby, I got it. Let me.

166
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,648
You should listen to it.
Just don't put too much pressure on it.

167
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,711
She's right.
I mean, this idea that

168
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:49,358
someone's last words have
to be profound and meaningful?

169
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:50,904
I mean, who can live up to that?

170
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,072
Exactly.

171
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,432
All those "famous last word"" people
supposedly said? They're all made up.

172
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:57,740
Like that patriotic dude,

173
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:00,164
Nathan Hale,
from third-grade history?

174
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,166
My I only regret...

175
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,627
is I have
but one life to lose for my country.

176
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:08,881
You know
what his real last words were?

177
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,717
I'm peeing my pants!

178
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,802
True story.

179
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,806
The point is,
last words are overrated.

180
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,641
Look, think of it this way:

181
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:22,853
you get to hear your dad's voice
one last time.

182
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,480
I should go listen to this...

183
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,316
alone, okay? I'll be back.

184
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:36,325
- So, I heard you might have...
- You heard right.

185
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,911
I'm getting a reputation.

186
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,122
So, what you need, mama?
Come here.

187
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,211
Guys, listen to what just happened.

188
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,797
Judy, do you need a break?
I'm happy to cook for a while.

189
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,112
You think your snobby
New York cooking is

190
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:55,844
better than mine... admit it!

191
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,431
Go ahead, Lily,
why don't you just whip up a batch

192
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:03,485
of your fancy tofu sushi bagels!

193
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,354
And choke on them!

194
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,190
- Are you okay?
- Listen!

195
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:12,795
I'm gonna go take a nap.

196
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,030
Judy's finally sleeping
and it's all because of me!

197
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:20,203
Guys, I have a role.
I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!

198
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,207
This day is tough on you, too.
You sure you can absorb all that?

199
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,184
Robin gave me a little pill
from her purse.

200
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:31,463
I don't know what is it, but things are
flowing pretty smooth right now.

201
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,923
Stay hydrated.

202
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:37,386
So?

203
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:40,021
I couldn't listen to it.

204
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:41,640
Guys, this is hard.

205
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,766
We know, baby.

206
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,768
But you'll always wonder,
if you don't.

207
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:46,144
Your dad loved you.

208
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,166
It almost doesn't matter
what he said.

209
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,608
It doesn't.

210
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,450
Guys, what if God forbid...

211
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:54,111
all of your dads died right now?

212
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:57,238
What would their last words
to you have been?

213
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:58,573
Seriously.

214
00:10:59,614 --> 00:11:00,826
I know mine.

215
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,047
When I was in Cleveland last month,

216
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:05,328
I went to visit my dad at his...

217
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:08,166
post-divorce bachelor pad.

218
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:11,764
Been fun bro-ing out
with you tonight, T-Dawg.

219
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:16,692
So glad we can talk
about our sex lives now.

220
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,476
That's totally an improvement.

221
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,771
I hooked up with a younger woman
the other week...

222
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,330
Donna Bromstead.

223
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:26,143
My prom date?

224
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,353
How far did you get, T-Dawg?

225
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,166
I have to go.

226
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,655
How would you like those
to be your father's last words?

227
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,823
They might be.

228
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,176
Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.

229
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:48,206
Lawyered.

230
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:56,468
<i>Lily, it's Dad.</i>

231
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,426
<i>Listen, I'm sort of in jail</i>

232
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,528
<i>for not paying taxes
for the last 25 years.</i>

233
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,206
<i>But bright side, I thought
of a great new board game.</i>

234
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,803
<i>"Tax Evasion", ages six to ten.</i>

235
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:08,468
<i>Which is, ironically,
what I might be looking at.</i>

236
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,673
<i>Anyway, Pumpkin, I need $15,000.</i>

237
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,033
Fooled ya.

238
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,008
Leave a message after the beep.

239
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,456
We'll get back to ya.

240
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,370
Lawyered.

241
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:31,208
And so, despite the endless
disappointment you've caused me,

242
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:33,043
<i>I pray</i>

243
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,767
that this will finally be the year
you achieve something

244
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:37,172
of actual significance.

245
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,759
I'd love to stop lying to my friends
about you being in a coma.

246
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,318
Anyway, the point is,

247
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:46,718
happy birthday, RJ.

248
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,435
That's awful.

249
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,186
No, here's the awful part.

250
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:54,202
You remembered my birthday!

251
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,130
Lawyered.

252
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:01,827
Now can we all just admit

253
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:04,491
that last words are,
in fact, a big deal?

254
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:09,037
Man, I always thought I had it rough

255
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,581
not really knowing my dad, but...

256
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:14,881
now I realize at least
I'll never have to suffer like this.

257
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,363
Our next video is called
"German Shepherd

258
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:21,683
Activates Tennis Ball Cannon
While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink."

259
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:23,802
Please, Barney!
No more videos.

260
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,013
I just need a minute.

261
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,269
Who is responsible for this?

262
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,624
Who got Cousin Daphne drunk?

263
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:37,190
She is 15 years old.

264
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:39,276
They grow big out here.

265
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,445
Here's your phone number back.

266
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:46,346
- Judy, I...
- I did it.

267
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,912
What possible excuse
could you have for this?

268
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,177
I'm from New York.

269
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:54,541
We think getting
minors drunk is funny.

270
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,028
There's nothing funny about
getting minors drunk!

271
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:00,489
You should be ashamed, Lily!

272
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:01,673
Ashamed!

273
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:07,926
Oh, cripes, that's tasty.

274
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:13,468
That salad's the first food
she's eaten in two days.

275
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:16,646
Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise
and jelly beans, but it counts.

276
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:18,315
At least someone's helping.

277
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,465
We haven't made Marshall laugh once.

278
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,315
Showing videos of guys

279
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,675
getting hit in the nuts
wasn't going to do anything.

280
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,449
- I'm just stupid.
- Stupid.

281
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:30,494
What we need to do is
hit each other in the nuts.

282
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,081
Nothing beats
the immediacy of live theater.

283
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,811
But which one of us is
going to take the hit?

284
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,464
So that's it?

285
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,789
No discussion?

286
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,004
I'm not going to listen.

287
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,285
"Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee III</i>"

288
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,153
are the last words
that my father will ever say to me,

289
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,186
and I think I can live with that.

290
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,467
Is he laughing?

291
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:03,095
<i>And Marshall really did think
he could live with that.</i>

292
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,694
<i>That is, until later,</i>

293
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,530
<i>at the memorial service.</i>

294
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:09,476
My last talk with Marvin

295
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,451
was so lovely.

296
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,235
<i>The stories his mother and brothers
told were so perfect.</i>

297
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:18,220
Then he picked my crying son up
off the ice.

298
00:15:18,345 --> 00:15:19,986
He gave him a hug and said,

299
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:23,170
"Champ, it doesn't matter
if you fall down once in a while."

300
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:26,883
And as we hiked,
a little deer appeared on the path.

301
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,970
She hopped over to Dad
and started eating...

302
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,903
right out of his hand.

303
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:35,787
And then he kissed me and he said...

304
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:38,181
"I will always be proud of you"

305
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:40,277
"Life is such a gift."

306
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:42,482
"You know something, gorgeous,

307
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:45,976
I'm the luckiest man alive."

308
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,990
Lame.

309
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:51,867
These stories suck.

310
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,100
Doesn't hold a candle to
your <i>Crocodile Dundee</i> thing.

311
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,419
You're up next, baby.

312
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,370
I just need some air.

313
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,704
Are you okay?

314
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:16,725
I have to listen to it.

315
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:32,449
It's a pocket dial.

316
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:35,933
It's nothing.

317
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:46,963
So...

318
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,581
it's a pocket dial.

319
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,270
You have so many great memories
with your dad.

320
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,127
Who cares about the last one?

321
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,097
- She's right.
- Your dad was hilarious.

322
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,932
You guys don't get it, okay?

323
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,461
None of you do.

324
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:03,021
My dad was my hero.

325
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,839
And he was my teacher.

326
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:08,693
And he was my best friend.

327
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,837
He always came through for me.

328
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,654
And now he's just gone.

329
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,136
And what am I left with?

330
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,205
Thanks a lot, God!

331
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:26,961
Thank you!

332
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,405
You took my father...

333
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:32,610
the greatest man
that I have ever known

334
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:35,450
and you ripped him off this Earth,
way too young!

335
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,616
And he'll never get to
meet our kids, Lily.

336
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:44,562
But we got this voice mail.

337
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,046
Thank you so much
for the voice mail!

338
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,651
It's a great comfort!

339
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,205
Because whenever I'm starting
to feel lonely or sad,

340
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,657
or you know what,
or maybe a little bit cheated,

341
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,993
at least I got the sound of his pocket
to console me.

342
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,621
How is this fair?

343
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,766
You know, like, an entire human life

344
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,670
and it just ends

345
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:08,674
for no reason, and...

346
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,391
what are we left with?

347
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,686
<i>Looks like I've been calling
you for almost five minutes.</i>

348
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,177
<i>How's my pocket sound?</i>

349
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,125
<i>Sorry about that, buddy.</i>

350
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,691
<i>Anyway, your mom and I had
such a great time seeing you.</i>

351
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:30,614
<i>I love you.</i>

352
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:37,073
Looks like your dad came through
one last time.

353
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:47,772
"I love you."

354
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,175
My father's last words
to me are "I love you."

355
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,193
And let me know
if you find my foot cream.

356
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:58,386
That fungus thing
is acting up again.

357
00:19:02,937 --> 00:19:04,087
"I love you."

358
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,210
My father's last words
to me are "I love you".

359
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,047
- We heard it.
- Loud and clear.

360
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:15,062
Bye, Pop.

361
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:19,495
<i>So Marshall finally got up to speak.</i>

362
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,654
<i>Funny thing, though...</i>

363
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,746
Then my father said the last words
that he'll ever say to me...

364
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:29,608
"Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee III</i>.

365
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:31,853
"I caught it on the cable last night

366
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:33,630
and it totally holds up."

367
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:38,092
<i>He decided to keep Marvin's
real last words just for himself.</i>

368
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:40,227
Thanks.

369
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:41,647
For what?

370
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:44,331
I know what you've been doing today.

371
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:47,247
And I really needed it.

372
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:48,862
Any time.

373
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:54,288
That dress makes you look
like a Kansas City whore.

374
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:57,661
Sorry, dear. Last one.

375
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,118
Oh, man.

376
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:07,622
I should have rented
<i>Crocodile Dundee III</i>.

377
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:12,085
Okay, seriously,
how are you doing that?

378
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,639
I'll be right back.

379
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,430
If I don't come back,

380
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,392
then these are my last words
to you all.

381
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,856
I really, really,
really love you guys.

382
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,901
Now I'm going to go drop a deuce.

383
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,196
<i>Last words,
it's a lot of pressure, kids.</i>

384
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:45,535
<i>It gets you thinking.</i>

385
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:49,108
Hi, Dad.

386
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:51,726
Hi, Dad.

387
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,121
Hi, Dad.

388
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Hey, Mom.

389
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:00,683
I'm ready to meet my dad.
