1
00:00:01,495 --> 00:00:03,701
And so, due to one
architectural oversight,

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:06,271
the Toledo Bridge Disaster of 1906

3
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:08,825
claimed the lives of 75 people.

4
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,544
Now, I hate to stop
while I'm on a roll,

5
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,513
but happy Halloween, ya crazies!

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,435
Professor Brosby, you gonna
come get beers with us later?

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,882
Nah, I got a thing.

8
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:22,897
But you kids have fun
trick or treating.

9
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,106
This is our treat.

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,484
You're the coolest, Professor Mosby.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,852
Well, hot dog.

12
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:30,655
- Did it hurt?
- What?

13
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:34,223
Getting that kid's nose
surgically removed from your ass.

14
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,208
It's not her nose
that's in my ass, Lily,

15
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,412
it's her heart.

16
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:40,113
My class loves me.

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,291
I'm really making
an impression on those guys.

18
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:45,961
I'd like to make impression
on those guys.

19
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,764
Man, I love the office
Halloween party.

20
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:51,884
It is so much sluttier
than the office Christmas party.

21
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,552
Though not as freaky

22
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:55,727
as the office President's Day Rave.

23
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:58,724
Or the office Tu B'Shvat
Pajama Jammy-Jam.

24
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,394
Hey, guys.
Hey, Boss.

25
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,062
Hey, Randy.
You want a beer?

26
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,689
No, thank you. I brew my own.

27
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,362
At the risk of bragging,
my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize

28
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:12,321
at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam
Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic.

29
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,241
I wouldn't consider any
part of that bragging.

30
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,770
It just occurred to me,
is your friend...

31
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,495
What's her name? Garbin, Flabin...

32
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,332
Robin. That's it, yeah. Is she gonna
be here? Not that I really care.

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,959
Robin has another party to go to.

34
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,521
No! Damn it!

35
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:29,380
- I'm leaving.
- But she might stop by later.

36
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,046
I guess I can
hang out a little longer.

37
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,207
So, anyone going to see
the Halloween parade?

38
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,477
<i>We were big fans of New York's
annual Halloween parade.</i>

39
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,448
<i>I don't mean the one that takes place
Halloween night in the Village.</i>

40
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,108
<i>I mean the one that takes place
the morning of November 1st...</i>

41
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,762
<i>the Annual Post Halloween
Walk of Shame Parade.</i>

42
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,321
Look at them heading home

43
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,689
after their dirty, filthy hookups.

44
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,086
Looks like that bee got busy.

45
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:05,133
Looks like that French maid
didn't turn down somebody's bed.

46
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,408
Looks like Pocahontas
has a couple of wounded knees.

47
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,988
- Come on.
- That's a line.

48
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,797
- It's because of the...
- We get it.

49
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,549
Does it get any better than this?

50
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:17,428
Yes, it does.

51
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:21,949
Crap.

00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,314

.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

57
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:38,991
There she is...

58
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,842
Florence-Night-In-Bed
With-A-Stranger.

59
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,623
- So, who's the lucky patient?
- I don't want to talk about it.

60
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,667
Please tell me you're not hooking up
with one of your co-anchors again.

61
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,670
- My co-anchor's a woman.
- Please tell me you are.

62
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,380
<i>Robin had always believed</i>

63
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,759
<i>the key to success was intelligence,
hard work and professionalism.</i>

64
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,928
<i>Her new co-anchor
had a different philosophy.</i>

65
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,016
<i>It's the Farhampton Boat Show!</i>

66
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,648
<i>Remember 5th, 6th and 7th
at the Farhampton Civic Center.</i>

67
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,961
<i>Come on down.</i>

68
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,614
You did a commercial?

69
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,907
Why not?

70
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:22,827
You're a journalist!
Don't you wanna be taken seriously?

71
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,286
No. I'm cute.

72
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:27,706
Well, if you really think
this is going to help your image.

73
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,543
Boats, boats, boats!

74
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,612
Robin, a little help here?

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,759
You gotta not worry so much
about being liked.

76
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,054
Easy for you to say.
Everybody loves you at your job.

77
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:43,973
<i>That was true of my teaching job.</i>

78
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,517
<i>But I was also designing
the new headquarters</i>

79
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,227
<i>for GNB, and well...</i>

80
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,647
We don't like you!

81
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,357
What do you say to yourself,
tearing down a beautiful, old building

82
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,069
to put up
a stupid bank headquarters?

83
00:03:58,743 --> 00:03:59,743
Boo...

84
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,199
freakin'...

85
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,324
hoo.

86
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,493
Boo freakin' hoo? That's it?

87
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,581
The Arcadian
is an architecturally significant...

88
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,504
Architecturally significant?!

89
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:13,919
You're very pretty.
Your hair smells great.

90
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,963
Shampoo.
You should try it sometime.

91
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,549
You don't know the first thing
about architecture.

92
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:21,017
Key, Ted Mosby's car.

93
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,344
Go on.

94
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,850
I'm a professor, okay?

95
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:26,515
I teach this stuff at one
of the best colleges in the country.

96
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:29,797
I don't go down to your place
of non-employment and lecture you

97
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:32,592
about how your little protest
is a misguided waste of time,

98
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,494
except, whoops, I just did.

99
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,691
Ha-burn.

100
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,360
- Good, the eggs are here.
- Well, I should head up.

101
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,400
<i>No, GNB was not popular.</i>

102
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,949
<i>That's why every year they produced
a video to improve the bank's image.</i>

103
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,378
<i>What makes Goliath National Bank
different from other big banks?</i>

104
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,371
<i>Here at GNB, we care.</i>

105
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,362
I care about our precious Earth.

106
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,589
I care about old people.

107
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,078
I care about high-yield
offshore investments.

108
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:02,621
And so does Tugboat here.

109
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:04,782
Isn't that right, Tugboat?
Yeah.

110
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,082
Okay, get that camera out of my face

111
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,100
before I flip you
like a cheese omelet.

112
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,852
All you have to do is say,

113
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:15,147
"I care about
making dreams come true."

114
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:18,173
First of all, that line
makes me sound like a hooker

115
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,569
and saying it makes me
feel like a hooker.

116
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,783
Everyone is in this video.

117
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:24,239
Randy's in the video.

118
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:26,481
I don't want to brag,
but in 29 takes,

119
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,243
I only threw up thrice.

120
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:31,705
Randy, did you send the Hermanson
contracts downtown?

121
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,690
I did.

122
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,333
I sent them downtown.

123
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,336
Why are you saying it like that? They
never arrived at the downtown office.

124
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:38,652
They...

125
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:42,088
To make sure we're on the same page,
is "send them downtown"

126
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:44,343
not an expression
for shredding a document?

127
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,428
You shredded them?

128
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,089
I sent them downtown.

129
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,848
You know, down into the shredder.

130
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,141
You feed the paper

131
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,936
in a downwards fashion, so that's
where the expression comes from.

132
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,480
That's not an expression!
That has never been an expression!

133
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,108
I can fix this.
I am all over this project.

134
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,178
I'll say this,
there is no quit in that guy.

135
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,514
- You should fire him.
- Okay, that, that right there.

136
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,953
That attitude is exactly why
I won't be in your video.

137
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:12,596
Because GNB doesn't care.

138
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,790
They hand out pink slips
like they're <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>.

139
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,001
Last week,
I was talking to Arthur...

140
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,129
You're wearing a green tie now.

141
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,824
I'm wearing a green tie.

142
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,872
GNB treats people like
they're disposable,

143
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:27,668
and I will not be a part of that.

144
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:28,870
Marshall Eriksen

145
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:31,974
does not fire people, period.

146
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:36,645
Just want you to know, we are making
good progress on this new project.

147
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:40,026
You gentlemen keep talking,
I will answer that.

148
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,317
Marshall Eriksen's office.

149
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,906
Yeah, I can get that for you.
Just a second.

150
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,619
Bank.
The <i>B</i> stands for bank.

151
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,703
Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight.

152
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,247
Yikes. I'd better get
Mr. Messy a napkin.

153
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,222
Period.

154
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,509
Tell me who you slept with!

155
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,344
I don't want to get into it.

156
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:11,764
It's someone we know.

157
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,933
If it was some ding dong we didn't know,
you'd just give me his name.

158
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:15,959
Fine.

159
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,567
It's Bill Pepper.

160
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,230
Bill Pepper.

161
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,192
Kind of a coincidence
there happens to be

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,527
a bill and a pepper
shaker here on the table.

163
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:29,573
Any chance you and Bill had
a three-way with Fork Napkin?

164
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,445
It's someone we know!

165
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,950
I'm assuming you all read the chapters
on the Greek Revival architecture.

166
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:38,957
Questions?

167
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,876
Yes.
How do you sleep at night?

168
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,890
- What are you doing here?
- It was recently made clear to me

169
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:51,692
that I don't know the first
thing about architecture, so...

170
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,595
here I am.

171
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:55,854
Very well.

172
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:57,829
Let's get started.

173
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,516
Some examples of Greek Revival
architecture...

174
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:04,106
Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?

175
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:08,652
What's The Arcadian?

176
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,974
It's just this beautiful,
old building

177
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,156
that Professor Mosby
wants to tear down.

178
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,324
What? No.

179
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:16,306
Professor Mosby loves old buildings.

180
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,036
He wouldn't do that.
Right, Ted?

181
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:22,165
Getting back to Greek Revival...

182
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,668
I lost them.

183
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,363
Look, you're new at teaching.

184
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:30,281
In my kindergarten class, I have had
plenty of troublesome students.

185
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:32,509
Like Johnny Marley...

186
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:43,941
He and that little stuffed horsey
raised all kinds of hell.

187
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,399
But I have a simple method for
shutting down troublemakers.

188
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,639
You know that '98 Taurus
that's always parked outside?

189
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,696
The one with the really
annoying alarm?

190
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,124
We're familiar with it.

191
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,043
When a kid like Johnny
acts up in my class...

192
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,516
Shuts them right up.

193
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,757
My students are adults,
and I treat them that way.

194
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:26,730
I'll give them more candy and make them
a mix CD. Problem solved.

195
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:29,357
Baby, what's wrong?

196
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,861
Something bad happened.

197
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:36,650
- Have you seen...
- Before that,

198
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,318
regarding the earlier project
I was working on...

199
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,913
<i>Voilà!</i>

200
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,930
That's the Hermanson contract?

201
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:44,444
The Hermanson contract?

202
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:47,472
Oh, man, this is
the Filbert contract.

203
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:48,597
Damn it!

204
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,002
Anyway, what's your thing?

205
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,173
I need the Filbert contract!

206
00:09:58,616 --> 00:09:59,782
I'll do what I can.

207
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:03,317
But in my experience, twice
shredded is fairly permanent.

208
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:06,475
Sorry, Randy,

209
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,998
but this just isn't working out.

210
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,941
Marshall popped his cherry!

211
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:15,528
Come on, Marshall, you have to admit,
the guy was a disaster.

212
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:17,896
It reflected badly on the company.

213
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,269
He was an embarrassment.

214
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:21,701
A huge embarrassment.

215
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,120
You slept with Randy!

216
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:25,330
What?

217
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:27,898
It's elementary,
my dear Scherbatson.

218
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:32,796
<i>Your co-host is getting super-popular
because of her stupid commercial,</i>

219
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:37,259
<i>So, when you arrived
at the GNB party after we left,</i>

220
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,277
<i>you were feeling vulnerable</i>

221
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,572
<i>and drunk.</i>

222
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:44,140
<i>Then, from across
the not-so-crowded conference room,</i>

223
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,017
<i>your eyes met.</i>

224
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,190
<i>And as we all remember...</i>

225
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:54,773
<i>Randy has a unique condition.</i>

226
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,153
Your nose is bleeding like a faucet.

227
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:00,824
God, this happens every time
I get an erection, I am so sorry.

228
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,832
That's...

229
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,082
exactly what happened.

230
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:14,671
If getting fired is an execution,
at least the guy had a last meal.

231
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,507
I promise you,
tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.

232
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:21,511
What's going on?

233
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,930
I just wanted to say,
no hard feelings.

234
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,085
Thank you.

235
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,351
So where are you headed now?

236
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,072
Downtown.

237
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:40,413
It's okay, baby.

238
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:42,866
<i>It wasn't okay.
So the next morning...</i>

239
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:45,285
Arthur,
I'm here because I made a mistake.

240
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:46,745
I fired Randy yesterday.

241
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,497
That was a mistake.
You should have fired him a year ago.

242
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:50,665
No, sir,

243
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,889
that is what's wrong with this company.
How can we say "GNB Cares,"

244
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,172
and then turn around
and treat someone like that?

245
00:11:57,513 --> 00:12:00,133
Sure, he made a few mistakes,
but everybody makes mistakes.

246
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,476
Like Tugboat here.

247
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,888
I bet you he's made some mistakes.

248
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,474
And you didn't fire Tugboat,
did you?

249
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,851
No, I got him fixed,
and he calmed down.

250
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,640
Exactly... kind of.

251
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:15,023
Randy doesn't need to be fired.
He needs to be fixed.

252
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:18,360
We do some pretty bad things
around here, but I...

253
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,691
Sir, I'm saying
instead of getting rid of someone

254
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,573
when they screw up, we should...
we should help them.

255
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,440
We should nurture them.

256
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,876
I changed the ice pack on his crotch
every hour for three days.

257
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,889
If you want to un-fire Randy,
I support you,

258
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:43,343
because to come in here
and say what you just said,

259
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:45,595
you've got a couple things
that Tugboat doesn't.

260
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:53,228
Prof Rock
is a really good mix, okay?

261
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:55,707
A piece of New York history
is being torn down,

262
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:58,632
and all you could say
was "Boo freakin' hoo"?

263
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:03,655
I may have mentioned our conversation
over a session of hacky sack.

264
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:07,362
The one day I miss the sack circle,
you guys sub her in?

265
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:08,724
Why'd you miss?

266
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:11,121
Too busy tearing down
the Statue of Liberty?

267
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,126
I was returning a hot dog costume
that you all enjoyed.

268
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,838
<i>They were all turning against me,</i>

269
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,798
<i>so I figured, what the hell.</i>

270
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:38,968
- And, did it work?
- Like gangbusters. We're buddies again.

271
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,765
After class, we hacked a little sack

272
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,819
to the thumpin' strains
of my Prof Rock CD.

273
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:45,312
And no, none of them
had heard the Pixies B-side.

274
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:47,497
Actually, none of them
had heard of the Pixies.

275
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:48,741
Or a B-side.

276
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:52,535
I know that smile.

277
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,527
Lily, there's no easy way
to say this.

278
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:57,000
Marshall's dead.
Randy murdered him.

279
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,962
I know why Randy is smiling.

280
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,338
You're smiling because of Robin.

281
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,425
Like how I think about her
when I'm in the shower?

282
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,993
I'm trying to eat.

283
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,138
Because you slept with her
on Halloween.

284
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:12,966
What? No.
I went home,

285
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,351
had a shower, and went to bed.

286
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,769
- You didn't sleep with her?
- No.

287
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:21,024
Even in the shower,
the farthest we ever get is hugging.

288
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,568
So why are you smiling?

289
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:24,944
I'll tell you why.

290
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:27,489
This just isn't working out.

291
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,259
<i>I'm fired. Great.</i>

292
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:33,624
<i>This is the candle kiosk
at the mall all over again.</i>

293
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:35,589
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

294
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:37,614
<i>I can get a severance check.</i>

295
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:39,159
<i>If I don't shred it,</i>

296
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:42,084
<i>I can use that money
to start my own brewery.</i>

297
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,566
<i>Imagine a beer with my name on it.</i>

298
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,651
<i>Randy Wharmpess,
this is the best day of your life.</i>

299
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,704
Thanks to that severance check,
this time next year,

300
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:56,434
you'll all be enjoying
a frothy mug of Wharmpess.

301
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,353
Randy, great news!

302
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,646
You're not fired!

303
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,052
Good morning, everybody...

304
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:15,245
Where's my class?

305
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:21,631
Ha-boom.

306
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,507
I got you your job back, Randy.

307
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:28,883
You'd be happy?

308
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,391
But I don't belong here.

309
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:33,304
I'm born to be a brewer!
A hopsmeister!

310
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:35,431
Then quit.
No one's stopping you.

311
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,277
I can't.
I need my severance check.

312
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,894
Well, I'm sorry Randy,
but that's called fraud.

313
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:42,683
It's not fraud.
I'm asking you to get me a lot of money

314
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,567
to not work here
and not tell anyone about it.

315
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:48,069
Even if I wanted to fire you,
after my talk with Arthur...

316
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,269
Come on, Arthur can't remember that.

317
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:53,074
What a memorable talk
we had yesterday.

318
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:58,956
On behalf of everyone at GNB,
both in and out of prison, we're sorry.

319
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,666
And I want to assure you
you will never be fired again.

320
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,541
You're going to work here
until you die!

321
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:06,796
Green tie?

322
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:09,591
Nice choice.

323
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,222
Thanks. It brings out my eyes.

324
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:13,529
I'll bring out your eyes.

325
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:16,337
Listen, Randy, I'm sorry,

326
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:19,512
but I broke my own moral code once
and I felt evil.

327
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:21,582
I will not let GNB change me.

328
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:25,498
I will never fire anyone again ever.

329
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:27,483
We'll see about that.

330
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,461
Anyhoo, while I got you, big smile.

331
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:38,104
"We care about making dreams come true",
in three, two...

332
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,123
What?

333
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,296
Are you unhappy with my performance?

334
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:45,877
Well, I guess I'm fired, then.
I'd better turn in my I.D.

335
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,298
No, it's actually...

336
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:51,065
nice having some of this clutter
off my desk.

337
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,156
And there's more.

338
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,186
I dunno what I'll use this for,
but it's great.

339
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:04,479
Now am I fired?

340
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,199
I've been meaning
to clean out that file cabinet for ages.

341
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:10,818
I'm not even here.

342
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,236
Randy, the coffee.

343
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,329
I've been meaning
to cut back on my caffeine.

344
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,854
Here, try this,
but really go for it.

345
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,541
Remember, this guy ruined your life.

346
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,966
That's just the pick-me-up I needed.

347
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,844
Speaking of that,
can we try the first one again?

348
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:45,561
It didn't work. They hate me.
How do I get them to like me again?

349
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,924
You don't.
Ted, you're their teacher.

350
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,220
The only people
that like their teachers...

351
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,151
- I like my teachers.
- ... are dorks.

352
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:54,362
Except for you, Miles.

353
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,548
You just have to learn
to embrace their hatred.

354
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:02,578
Because behind that hatred
lies fear.

355
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:04,489
And you can use use that fear,

356
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:06,749
like I did with Johnny Marley.

357
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:08,209
Was there more to that?

358
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:10,007
A little bit.

359
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:30,732
Tou're a psychopath.

360
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,899
A little bit.

361
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:34,360
A panda!

362
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:38,609
<i>I thought about Lily's advice.</i>

363
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,984
<i>And I figured fear was worth a try.</i>

364
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:46,539
What do you want to say to us?

365
00:18:47,615 --> 00:18:50,165
Anyone not in class tomorrow
gets an "F".

366
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:54,959
You said that?

367
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,661
Technically, they'd get an incomplete,
but I thought...

368
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,719
"F" had a nice, scary ring to it.

369
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:04,358
- Who'd you sleep with?
- I told you, Randy.

370
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:06,434
He was a machine.

371
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:07,935
Where's the poop?

372
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:12,741
Fine.
I didn't sleep with anyone.

373
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,994
The thing is,
ever since Becky did that commercial,

374
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,673
everyone at work loves her.

375
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,072
The day after Halloween,
I was in a commercial.

376
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:21,949
What... Why didn't you tell us?

377
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:25,870
<i>Bladder trouble, it's embarrassing,</i>

378
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,998
<i>it's uncomfortable,
and it can affect anyone.</i>

379
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,336
I'm going to the bathroom right now.

380
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:35,011
<i>Neat and discreet adult diapers
for anyone.</i>

381
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,422
Say...

382
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,733
I can't wait to see it.

383
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:50,739
Hopefully you never will.
They might not even use it.

384
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:52,271
<i>It ran for seven years.</i>

385
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:56,567
You win.

386
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,654
Maybe trashing your office
was a mistake.

387
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:02,988
It's just as long as I can remember,

388
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:04,867
making beer has been my dream.

389
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,799
Wharmpess?

390
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:14,370
I know it sounds dumb to someone
who's already achieved his dream...

391
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:16,796
big-time lawyer
at a huge corporation.

392
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:19,173
You think working here is my dream?

393
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:20,716
Of course.

394
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,585
Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up.

395
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,305
Have someone get that dead squirrel
out of your desk.

396
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:33,688
This is delicious.

397
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:36,698
You're fired.

398
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,439
<i>Kids, the next morning,</i>

399
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,948
<i>my class
had the highest attendance ever.</i>

400
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:47,550
<i>And not long after that,</i>

401
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:50,371
<i>Randy used his severance money
to start a little brewery.</i>

402
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:54,313
<i>Now you can have a Wharmpess
at every bar in America.</i>

403
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:55,585
<i>And all because...</i>

404
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,837
I care about making dreams
come true.

405
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:01,927
You got what you need?

406
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,750
That's a wrap.

9999
