1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,491
Barney, afraid this
is good-bye.

2
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:07,365
Your buzz kill of a ma

3
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,561
thinks I'm a... a bad
influence on you.

4
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:10,786
What? That's...

5
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:12,632
What is that word you taught me?

6
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:14,901
"Bull" something?

7
00:00:14,903 --> 00:00:16,720
But she's your
mother and I'm...

8
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:19,105
you know, I'm just
your Uncle Jerry.

9
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,525
So, this is the last
time I can see you.

10
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:24,010
But you're supposed to
take me to see

11
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,012
that Zeppelin cover band
next week.

12
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,515
The night is gonna be...

13
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:30,951
Led-and-Jerry.

14
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:32,786
Sorry, buddy,
but this is it.

15
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:35,188
But don't you forget
your training.

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,907
What's a magician's best friend?

17
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:37,991
A drunk audience.

18
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,359
(laughs)
Attaboy.

19
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,913
You still got that button
from the festival we went to?

20
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:50,370
Now... I'm gonna put this

21
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:52,372
right inside your brain,
behind your ear...

22
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:56,610
so that I'll know that
you won't forget me.

23
00:00:58,346 --> 00:00:59,512
See you, buddy.

24
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:02,916
And hey...

25
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:06,853
Never... stop... partying.

26
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:12,659
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, in 1983,</i>
<i>Barney watched his father</i>

27
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,127
<i>walk out of his life.</i>

28
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,864
<i>And in 2011, when their</i>
<i>first reunion ended badly...</i>

29
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:20,533
I'd love nothing more
than to be a part of your life.

30
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:22,402
NARRATOR:
<i>This time it was Barney</i>
<i>who did the walking.</i>

31
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:23,703
Bye.

32
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:26,339
NARRATOR:
<i>And that was almost</i>
<i>the end of it.</i>

33
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,275
<i>Except, a few weeks later...</i>

34
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:31,811
I am so angry at my dad!

35
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:33,747
Guess who called me today.

36
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:36,082
Go on, guess.
Mmm.

37
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:38,418
Your dad?
My dad!

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,620
Barney Stinson.

39
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:41,922
Hi, Barney. It's your dad.

40
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,857
Look, would you
like to go fishing

41
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:45,458
with me and J.J.
on Sunday morning?

42
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,361
Ooh, hold on, let me
check my personality.

43
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:50,964
Oh, no. Turns out I would never
do that in a million years.

44
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,899
Barney, look...

45
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,235
I know you're disappointed
that your dad is just...

46
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:58,104
a boring old driving instructor
from the suburbs.

47
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:01,708
But that guy I used to be--
"Crazy Jerry"?

48
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,643
He was bad news!

49
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:06,079
Drinking, partying,
sleeping around.

50
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,581
The party can't go on forever.

51
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,584
You're 35; I'm-I'm sure
you're starting

52
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:13,053
to realize that, right?

53
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:16,790
You do not know
how right you are.

54
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,124
Zero right!

55
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,760
We're not getting too old for anything.
TED: You sure?

56
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:23,263
I feel like we collectively
learn the opposite lesson,

57
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:24,764
like, at least once a year.

58
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:25,932
(chuckling)

59
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,968
I have to face an ugly truth.

60
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,271
Jerry Whittaker, my own father,

61
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:33,640
is anti-awesome-etic.

62
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,542
I know

63
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,410
Crazy Jerry's still
in there somewhere,

64
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:40,747
but he's trapped under 20 years
of lawnmower parties

65
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:42,916
and carpool barbecues.
ROBIN: Wow,

66
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:44,985
you know nothing
about the suburbs.

67
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:47,988
Well, this Saturday night,
I am bustin' him out.

68
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,055
I'm gonna

69
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:50,824
make Jerry realize he was wrong

70
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:53,727
about giving up his old life
by showing him

71
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,963
the awesomest night
of all time.

72
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,598
And for the awesomest night

73
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,103
of all time, I'm going to need
the awesomest friends

74
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:04,337
of all time.

75
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,008
Okay, who do I know?

76
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,213
Guys...!

77
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,816
Do any of you know
George Clooney?

78
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,285
Okay, my dad's almost here.

79
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,587
I need everything to be

80
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,706
as awesome as possible tonight.

81
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,224
That's why you
brought these guys.

82
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:28,194
No. That's why
I brought <i>these</i> guys.

83
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,195
I've made some

84
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:30,797
minor improvements
to your identities.

85
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,931
Uh.
Mm!

86
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,099
You'll find them
on these cards.

87
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,167
Improvements?!
BARNEY: Yeah.

88
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,053
Bro, we are
already the four

89
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,673
jiggity-jamminest dudes
and dudettes this side of...

90
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:42,826
Okay, let's see the cards.

91
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,277
Robin, no one watches the news

92
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,513
unless it's a car chase
or a nip slip.

93
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:47,380
You are now

94
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,898
a professional scotch taster.

95
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,050
Mm!

96
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:51,918
Lily, Jerry needs to learn
that other lifestyles

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,486
are just as fulfilling
as monogamy,

98
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:55,889
so now you and Marshall
are in an open marriage.

99
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:58,158
Whoo-hoo!
Gross!

100
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
Also, Marshall,
you can't just be unemployed,

101
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:01,728
so you are now

102
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,364
a gin-swilling,
womanizing playwright.

103
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,600
And, Ted, just be yourself.

104
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:10,236
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

105
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:13,373
Here's a giant pile of topics
you should avoid talking about.

106
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,608
Well. Well, this could
actually be fun.

107
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,711
In fact, I believe it
was Oscar Wilde who said,

108
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:21,347
"Man is least himself
when he talks..."

109
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:22,515
Ted, card.
Ah.

110
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:25,151
You're right--
"No quoting Oscar Wilde."

111
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:26,653
Finally...

112
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,321
Robin, you're dating Ted.

113
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:29,722
Aw, man!

114
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,124
Why?

115
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,358
BARNEY:
I can't have

116
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,160
any single female friends
lying around.

117
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:36,663
My dad'll be all,
"Why don't you marry Robin?

118
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:38,164
"You guys are cute together.
Deep down, you know

119
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,934
you were never happier
than when you were with her."

120
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:42,035
Uh...

121
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,403
(chuckles)
no, thanks.

122
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:45,205
Hey, Barney-- love
the new identities.

123
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:48,441
Little thing-- instead of
being a naked super ninja,

124
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:52,011
can I be Meryl Streep
in <i>The Devil Wears Prada?</i>

125
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,280
How good was that movie?
Oh, my God.

126
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:56,249
(others talking at once)

127
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:57,350
And...

128
00:04:57,352 --> 00:05:00,120
hence new identities.

129
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:04,424
NARRATOR:
<i>And so Barney's dad</i>
<i>finally showed up.</i>

130
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:06,726
Jerry, you remember Marshall--
he's a well-known writer.

131
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:08,094
Playwright.
We're all writers,

132
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:11,181
just some of us don't know
what our story is yet.

133
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,966
Lily, his wife.

134
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:16,136
Well, most nights.
Mama don't let no ring

135
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:18,204
get in the way of a good time.

136
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:20,106
That's... a
little depressing.

137
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,241
TED:
Uh, hi again.

138
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:22,342
Ted. Oh, and, Jerry,

139
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:24,494
you remember my girlfriend.
Robin. Hi.

140
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:26,646
So nice to see you again.

141
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:28,448
Wait, wait. Jerry,

142
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,849
I got to tell you
the truth.

143
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:31,050
Guys, I'm gonna tell him.

144
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:33,486
We're also a band.

145
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:35,121
ROBIN:
<i>Two, three, four!</i>

00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,553
Ow! Yeah!

152
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:54,006
So, Saturday night--
time to cut loose, right?

153
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:55,808
Who wants to split a beer?

154
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,510
BARNEY:
Oh, we're not drinking here.

155
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,145
Tonight we're going big.

156
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:01,781
Let's see, what club
should we hit first?

157
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:04,417
There's Club Was,
there's Wrong...

158
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:06,753
Um, those places shut
down a long time ago.

159
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:07,420
Oh, no.

160
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:08,454
Oh, No shut down, too.

161
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,056
There's Where?
Where's Where?

162
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:11,524
Where's where Was
was, isn't it?

163
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:14,294
No, Was wasn't where Where was,
Was was where Wrong was, right?

164
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,396
Okay. Not Okay.
That place is lame.

165
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:18,898
Okay is Lame?
I thought Lame was a gay bar.

166
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,933
Or is that Wrong?

167
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:21,801
That's wrong.
That's not Wrong.

168
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:22,735
Guys, focus.

169
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,203
Oh, I like Focus.
Let's go there.

170
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,905
Where?
Not Where. Focus.

171
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,407
I thought Focus
was closed.

172
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:28,575
No, Was was Closed.

173
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:31,010
Once Was shut down,
it reopened as Closed.

174
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,045
So Closed is open.

175
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:32,946
No, Closed is closed.

176
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:33,947
I don't know.

177
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,715
Third base! Right?

178
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,550
Ew, Third Base
is all frat guys.

179
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:38,718
I'll go anyplace, okay?

180
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,753
Not Okay. Okay is lame.

181
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:41,905
Okay is not Lame.

182
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,389
Lame is a gay bar.

183
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:44,290
Guys, shut up.

184
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:45,625
No, Shut up shut down.

185
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:48,494
I can't believe I don't
know the clubs anymore.

186
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,597
Guys, just pick
a club, okay?

187
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,198
Not Okay!

188
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,466
OTHERS:
Okay is Lame!

189
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:55,668
Gay bar.

190
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,905
For the record, I was in
there once by accident.

191
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:01,808
I'm pretty sure it's
pronounced Lamé.

192
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,711
It's hopeless, isn't it?

193
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:07,079
(dance music playing)
MARSHALL: <i>Wow.</i>

194
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,015
A lot of these girls
are young enough

195
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:10,583
to be our daughters.
I know.

196
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,251
Daddy's home.

197
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:14,420
And Granddaddy's home!

198
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:16,990
Tonight rocks so hard!

199
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:19,559
I might be allergic
to this stamp.

200
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:26,032
Oh, my God,
my secret crush is here.

201
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:27,000
Mila Kunis?!

202
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:29,769
No, <i>my</i> secret crush.

203
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:32,572
We met a few
years ago.

204
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:37,477
Hi. I could use
a woman's opinion.

205
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,179
Is this working for me?

206
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:41,814
Uh... no.

207
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:42,749
(laughs)

208
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:43,800
The only good thing

209
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,284
about how ugly that shirt is,

210
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:49,022
is that it distracts
from how terribly it fits you.

211
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:51,090
I was trying on the pants.

212
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,092
Oh. (laughs)

213
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,345
I had to leave
before we could

214
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:56,696
finish talking,
so that was it.

215
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:57,897
You know, ever
since then, I've...

216
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,166
Oh, my God, he's
coming over here.

217
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:01,434
Oh. Hello.

218
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:03,870
Hi. A few years ago at a
department store, Hi.

219
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:05,772
did you embarrass
the hell out of me?

220
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:08,441
Oh, I'm sorry,
you must have me confused

221
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:11,611
with the shirt
you were wearing that day.

222
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,312
I should be so lucky.

223
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:15,081
Hi! I'm Ted!

224
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,699
Robin's boyfriend!

225
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,017
Nice to meet you.

226
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:19,485
Right.

227
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,921
Um... it was really nice
to see you again.

228
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,790
Mm-hmm. You, too.
Yeah.

229
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:24,791
(pats Robin twice)

230
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:27,043
(whispers):
You owe me one.

231
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:29,729
Man, isn't this
place great?

232
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:32,332
Uh, I don't know.
It's so loud!

233
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:33,666
And so bourgeois.

234
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:36,803
Many of plays are
about the bourgeois.

235
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:38,571
And ennui.

236
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:42,675
And one rock opera about...

237
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:45,078
a frozen yogurt shop.

238
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:49,849
Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk
about your open marriage.

239
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:53,653
Okay. Well, after a long day
of style meetings

240
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:55,355
and photo shoots

241
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:56,622
and being
way too mean

242
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:57,740
to my assistant,

243
00:08:57,742 --> 00:09:00,727
I sometimes bang
an underwear model.

244
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:01,594
My goodness!

245
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:02,729
I sleep around, too.

246
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:03,996
Just as much.

247
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:05,264
A little more, even.

248
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:08,033
Oh, uh, only 'cause you
have nothing to do all day.

249
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,602
Are we having
this fight again?

250
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:11,371
Writing plays is a real job!

251
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:15,007
I work 90 hours a week
subsidizing your "real job."

252
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,142
I won a Tony!

253
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:18,511
I brought French cooking
to America!

254
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:20,279
What?

255
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,116
Let's do shots.
Uh, no, thank you, Barney.

256
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,918
I have that fishing
trip with J.J. early tomorrow.

257
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,354
I-I better take it easy.
No.

258
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:30,823
Don't you remember what you said
to me when I was a kid?

259
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:33,159
"Never stop partying."

260
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,660
I said <i>that?</i>

261
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:36,462
To a six-year-old?

262
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:38,164
I don't remember that.

263
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,732
You don't remember
the last thing

264
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,135
you said to me when I was a kid?

265
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,170
Well...

266
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,172
you know, why don't you
just go back home?

267
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:47,790
But I want to hang out with you.

268
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,109
Yeah, well, I want to hang out
with Crazy Jerry,

269
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,445
not Stay-at-Home Jerome.

270
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:54,614
Fine.

271
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,449
You want Crazy Jerry?

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,663
There! You got him!

273
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:17,203
I apologize-- it might take
a few minutes to kick in.

274
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,438
Oh...
Oh...

275
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,606
(others talking at once)

276
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:27,544
Hey, sugar!
Five beers for the table,

277
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,137
a Seven-and-Seven for me,

278
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,773
and your ten digits
for this guy here!

279
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:35,994
Tonight Crazy Jerry's
gonna burn this disco down!

280
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:38,379
JERRY:
Whoo! Wa-hah!

281
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:39,747
Can you believe it?

282
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:41,349
This is awesome!
Barney,

283
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,851
how is <i>that</i> awesome?

284
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:47,188
? ?

285
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,159
I finally know what it's like
to be embarrassed by my dad.

286
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,027
So you really believe

287
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:55,430
that if we were in
an open marriage

288
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:57,732
that you would do better than me?
Hey,

289
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,318
you do better than me
at a lot of other things,

290
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,136
like digesting dairy...

291
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:04,605
and reaching for stuff.

292
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:05,840
Okay, you know what?

293
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,008
Game on.

294
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,877
If I can score five
numbers before you can,

295
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,146
then we have sex
in the bathroom.

296
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:13,248
But...

297
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,717
if you can score
five numbers before me,

298
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:18,286
then we have sex
in the bathroom.

299
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:19,520
So our usual wager.

300
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:21,589
Deal.

301
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:25,226
Hey, uh, hey, Jerry,

302
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,595
y-you really want to be
out here like this?

303
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:29,647
Oh, sorry, small-town preacher
from the Midwest,

304
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,800
is there a law against dancing?

305
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,652
No, of course not.
I-I just...

306
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:35,853
Oh, this club blows.

307
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,139
Let's hit the greatest
party in the world,

308
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:39,907
the streets of New York!

309
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,976
Yeah! Let's do it!
Yeah!

310
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:44,812
Uh, maybe fix the tie.

311
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,981
But mostly, party!

312
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:50,201
Okay, Jerry's gone;
let's break up.

313
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:53,154
Okay. "I would have stolen you
a whole orchestra."

314
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:54,622
There. What's the rush?

315
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:57,158
Well, that guy who came over
here who thinks we're dating,

316
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,593
I kind of have
a crush on him.

317
00:11:58,595 --> 00:11:59,827
Can you help me
clear it up?

318
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,329
Really? That guy?

319
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,797
He was, like, a four.

320
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,934
A four? God, you are, like,
the worst judge of guys ever.

321
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,532
Okay, if he is a
four, what are you?

322
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:10,308
Hey!

323
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,607
I'm not perfect;
I'm an eight...

324
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,475
and a half.

325
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,477
You're a doofus and a half.

326
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,146
Fine. Let's go talk to him.

327
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:19,981
Where'd you meet
this booger-eater anyway?

328
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:22,450
At a close-out
sale at Dawes.

329
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,485
Really?
I remember that sale.

330
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,354
TED:
Hey, Robin.

331
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:28,089
Oh, Ted. Oh, no.

332
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:29,757
Look what I just bought.

333
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,794
Right? Right?

334
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,396
Hold on.
We were dating then.

335
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:36,764
I specifically remember,

336
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,133
because we had great
sex that night.

337
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,502
Great sex.

338
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,588
Let me guess.

339
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,939
Someone wants to knock...

340
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:47,408
boots.
(imitating gunshots)

341
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,011
Boots.

342
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:52,080
Just take off your damn shirt.
Okay.

343
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:53,431
All right.

344
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,149
All right. Whoa,

345
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,401
stop.
What?

346
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:57,652
Stop. Perfect.

347
00:12:57,654 --> 00:13:00,188
But I-I can't see,
and you can't see me.

348
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,691
Yeah. Yeah, just like that.

349
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,527
You were picturing your crush!
Well,

350
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,596
<i>somebody</i> had to.

351
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:13,334
Okay, okay, answer me this.

352
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:17,071
Are you absolutely sure
it had nothing whatsoever...

353
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:19,407
to do with the boots?

354
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:20,975
Yes.

355
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:23,177
You hear that, everybody?

356
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,780
She said "yes"!
We're getting married!

357
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:26,848
(Ted chuckles)

358
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,015
I love this girl.

359
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,684
I'm never letting her go.

360
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,219
(loud smooch)

361
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,590
(chuckling)

362
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:38,476
Hey... Bottoms up, amigo!

363
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,111
NARRATOR:
<i>After that,</i>

364
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,730
<i>Barney's memory of the night</i>
<i>got a little hazy.</i>

365
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:44,565
You want to fight me?

366
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:49,537
Well, I'll fight you, dummy!

367
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,739
You don't even know!

368
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,574
(laughing):
Hey, hey! There we go!

369
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:55,276
(grunting)

370
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,129
(yelling)

371
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:01,749
Oh, look what I just ripped
out of the ground!

372
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:03,384
Oh...!

373
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,752
(laughing)

374
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:07,355
I just puked on the
hood of that...

375
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:09,891
(siren blares)
...police car! (laughing)

376
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:11,159
(both laughing)

377
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:13,995
Too bad your
playwright friend

378
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:16,197
isn't a lawyer.

379
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,331
Barney, I'm so sorry.

380
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:23,639
I'm afraid this
is what it's like

381
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,859
hanging out with
Crazy Jerry.

382
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,461
It's okay, Dad.

383
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:33,599
I never thought tonight
would be so awesome!

384
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,866
So...

385
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,635
next stop, strip club.

386
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:38,503
The Lusty Leopard
has a special...

387
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:40,939
Oh, for corn's sake,
Barney, I'm not drunk!

388
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:42,341
What?
I told you,

389
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,675
I don't party anymore,

390
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:46,044
and you wouldn't take
no for an answer.

391
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:47,112
So...

392
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:50,949
<i>I used a little...</i>
<i>sleight-of-hand...</i>

393
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:55,587
...to make you think otherwise.

394
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:56,939
Here you go.

395
00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:58,757
(laughs) Whoa!

396
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,959
Bottoms up, amigo!

397
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,444
(chuckles)

398
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:03,862
Mm.

399
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:06,431
But all those
crazy things you did.

400
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:10,068
Do you happen to remember what
a magician's best friend is?

401
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:13,738
A drunk audience.

402
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,308
You want to fight me?

403
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,745
Well, I'll fight you, dummy!

404
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:21,580
No, no, no.

405
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:24,583
You don't even know!

406
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:25,584
Right here!

407
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,119
Look.

408
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:30,288
Look what I just
ripped out of the ground!

409
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,289
Oh...!

410
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,258
(cackles)

411
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,444
(Barney groaning)

412
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:36,928
What just happened?

413
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,531
I... I just puked
on the hood of that...

414
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,266
(siren blares)
(chuckles)

415
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:42,567
...police car.

416
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,936
(chuckling)

417
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:46,838
Well, why do
all those things?

418
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,041
I figured if I
showed you what...

419
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:51,543
"never stop partying"
really looked like,

420
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:54,746
you'd realize you
can't do it forever.

421
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:58,116
(sighs heavily)
Oh, well.

422
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:04,723
You lied to me all night
for your own selfish reasons?

423
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:07,726
Daddy...!

424
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:12,030
I wanted to hang out
with you-- you're my son.

425
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,533
And since you didn't want
to come with me and J.J.

426
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:15,934
on that fishing tri--

427
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:18,704
Fishing trip.

428
00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:21,973
I'll never make it
back in time now.

429
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,446
Hey, you know, a-a pretty
good magician like you

430
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:28,947
probably knows
how to, say,

431
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,783
get out of a standard
set of handcuffs.

432
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,885
Perhaps.

433
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:37,756
Well, here's something
you didn't know--

434
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:40,726
I'm a pretty good
magician, too.

435
00:16:41,728 --> 00:16:44,379
(both giggling)

436
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:46,298
Abracadabra!

437
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,566
(both laughing)

438
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:49,384
Congratulations!

439
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:51,269
Oh, hey!
Thank you so much.

440
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,605
We're super excited.
We're thinking June.

441
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,040
(laughs)
Yeah, okay.

442
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,575
Okay, jerk...

443
00:16:56,577 --> 00:17:00,078
do you remember how you ended up
buying those red cowboy boots?

444
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,313
(chuckling):
Wow.

445
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,282
Wardrobe malfunction
at the O.K. Corral!

446
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,701
I mean, who in their
right mind would ever...

447
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:09,521
You would look
so totally hot in those.

448
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:11,856
Do you have these in a size 11?

449
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,760
So get off the field
at the Superdome,

450
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:16,394
because you ain't no saint.

451
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,131
Hello.

452
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,549
I, uh...
Oh.

453
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,768
Hi, Robin.

454
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,506
Could I have
your phone number?

455
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:29,975
We need someplace to hide.
Where?

456
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:32,310
No, Jerry, this is not the time
to go to another club!

457
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:36,114
We've got to get you back
home in time for that trip.

458
00:17:36,116 --> 00:17:38,617
But there's no more
trains, there's no cabs.

459
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:39,785
Well, uh...

460
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:43,405
I do have a few driving
students in the city.

461
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,357
Step on it! Jerry...
Do not step on it.

462
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,958
Jerry, we have got
to get you home

463
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,193
in time for
that fishing trip.

464
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:49,494
...the laws are there
to protect...

465
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,113
This is no time for laws!
Buckle up, Barney.

466
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:54,616
I am not going to buckle up!
I am your father! You will listen to me!

467
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,205
Hey! How's the
open marriage going?

468
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:01,907
Who was the first one
to get the five numbers?

469
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,008
I won that race.

470
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,644
My prize--
sex in the bathroom.

471
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:08,380
And I won <i>that</i> race.

472
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,885
Aw, sorry that secret crush
didn't work out for you.

473
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,056
Oh, it's okay. I guess
it just wasn't meant to be.

474
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:19,591
Why are you smiling?

475
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:20,992
I don't know.

476
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:23,428
Good night.

477
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,230
Saw that girl again.

478
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:27,365
And guess what?
She's engaged.

479
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,900
So that's the end of that.

480
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:31,319
NARRATOR:
<i>It wasn't the end of that.</i>
<i>More on that later.</i>

481
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:35,240
And her fiancé?
The guy's like a two.

482
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:40,278
How did you do it?

483
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,779
Do what?

484
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:44,115
How did you become this?

485
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:47,052
I mean, I love my life, but...

486
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:50,388
I'm not sure I <i>like</i>
loving it.

487
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,091
Sure, strip clubs...
You're drifting.

488
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,860
Hey, I'm trying to
open up to you...

489
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,562
No, Mrs. Perkins,
you're drifting!

490
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,966
Go on, Barney.

491
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:04,903
When I think about going for
anything more than that,

492
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:10,008
I look at my life,
and who I am, and...

493
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,845
I'm too far gone.

494
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,981
I'm broken.

495
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,337
Son, I was far more broken
than you'll ever be.

496
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:24,822
And look at me now.

497
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:29,961
Don't get me wrong-- settling
down is... a challenge.

498
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:32,230
It's the biggest
challenge of your life.

499
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:34,032
So how do you do it?

500
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:38,069
A magician never reveals
his greatest trick.

501
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,872
But I'll give you a hint.

502
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:43,508
You gotta meet the right girl.

503
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,395
Who knows?

504
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:50,181
Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.

505
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:53,652
Maybe I've met her already.

506
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,572
And park.
And emergency brake.

507
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,493
I did have a good time tonight.

508
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:02,894
And hey,
if you want to

509
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:04,863
go fishing,
we got room in the boat.

510
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:07,365
Maybe some other time.

511
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,733
Okay.

512
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,169
Oh, and, uh...

513
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:15,373
thanks for taking such
good care of this.

514
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,843
It means a lot to me that you
kept it safe all these years.

515
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:37,729
I'm going fishing with my dad.

516
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,124
(inhales deeply, exhales)

517
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:01,831
This...

518
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,666
sucks.
