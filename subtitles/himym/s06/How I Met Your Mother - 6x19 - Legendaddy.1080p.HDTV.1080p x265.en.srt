1
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:05,684
<i>Kids, I bought the house we live in now
way back before I ever met your mother.</i>

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:08,235
<i>It needed a lot of work
but I had a vision for it.</i>

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,218
Vintage rolltop desk here.

4
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,013
I haven't decided whether to put
the fern on the right or the left side,

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,417
but you know,
sometimes you just gotta wing it.

6
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,172
Left side.

7
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:19,978
And right outside, I want to put up
a basketball hoop for the kids.

8
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:23,440
This is your seduction lounge.

9
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,159
Sex swing there,

10
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:27,235
vibrating Jell-O pit right there,

11
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,404
rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel
right here.

12
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,698
Don't ask, you're not ready.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,409
And that basketball hoop?

14
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:36,883
Outdoor stripper pole.

15
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,258
We'll just tell the ladies
to be careful in the winter.

16
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,759
You think a <i>tongue</i> stuck
to a frozen pole is bad...

17
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,160
Let's go outside for a second.

18
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,195
We have a confession.

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,093
This wasn't really about
seeing Ted's house.

20
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:53,177
It's an intervention.

21
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,206
Thank God.
I'll go first.

22
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:57,801
Ted, this house you bought
for your hypothetical family

23
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:59,017
is super weird.

24
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:00,977
We talk about it behind your back.

25
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:03,159
This intervention isn't for me.

26
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:04,272
It's for you.

27
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:06,302
<i>Why did Barney need an intervention?</i>

28
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:07,984
<i>It all started a few nights earlier.</i>

29
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:11,822
I can't believe your giant TV is broken.
It's March Madness.

30
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,325
Okay, I think I see what the problem is.
Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?

31
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:16,618
Sure thing.

32
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,323
Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H.

33
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:20,831
I got a hundred bucks
if you can be here in five, thanks.

34
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,250
You call the Super for a screwdriver?

35
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,455
Here's the thing
about me and tools...

36
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,403
The only one I know how to use
is attached to me,

37
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:30,968
and I am not going to try
putting it in the TV.

38
00:01:31,093 --> 00:01:32,134
Again.

39
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:36,096
That's ridiculous.
Everyone should know how to use tools.

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,239
Well, here's our screwdriver now.

41
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,905
Guys, I'm pretty sure
that's not Luis.

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,193
But I can't be certain.
Someone introduce yourself.

43
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,358
I got your letter.

44
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,747
Dad?

45
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,160

.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

50
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:19,776
I can't believe Barney is talking
to his dad right now.

51
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:22,809
What do you say after three decades
of not seeing each other?

52
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,892
"So, how about those
last 30 Super Bowls"?

53
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,859
Now I feel bad about making fun of him
for the tool thing.

54
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,027
My dad was the one
who taught me all that stuff.

55
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,677
To be fair, everyone has
some glaring gap in knowledge,

56
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,865
something really obvious
you somehow never learned.

57
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,639
Okay, but a screwdriver?

58
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:40,660
I don't have any gaps
that fundamental.

59
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,538
I seem to recall...

60
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:47,709
Daniel Burnham was an architect
whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic

61
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,170
made him a true architectural
chamma-leeon.

62
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:53,215
And only the most gifted chamma-leeon

63
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,152
could've designed
classic <i>beaux arts</i> masterpieces

64
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,991
right alongside
sleek modern flatirons.

65
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:03,533
His name might as well have been
Daniel Chamma-leeon.

66
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,018
Professor?

67
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:09,147
Do you mean "chameleon"?

68
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:15,570
Betty, I'm pretty sure
it's pronounced "chamma-leeon," so...

69
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:20,217
Class dismissed.

70
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:22,118
No homework.
For a while.

71
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:24,963
Okay, I learned that word
by reading it.

72
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:26,832
That's how I've always pronounced it.

73
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,165
That wasn't easy.

74
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,252
It took a lot of "ch-aracter"
to admit that.

75
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,088
- Scherbatsky, you want to tussle?
- I'll tussle.

76
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,382
- Let's tussle.
- Marine biologist.

77
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,598
Please, no.

78
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:38,760
So this really sucks,

79
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,179
but I'm going to be in the North Pole
for three months.

80
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,932
Seriously?
The North Pole?

81
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:47,193
If you want to break up with me,
just tell it to me straight.

82
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,188
Don't pretend you're going
someplace we all know doesn't exist.

83
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:52,399
I'm going to be studying
the mating habits of...

84
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,566
Of who?

85
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,110
Santa's elves?
Rudolph?

86
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,470
You know what?
I'm going on a trip, too, Scott.

87
00:03:57,595 --> 00:03:59,081
It starts in Narnia.

88
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,701
It works its way up to Candyland,
and then, congratulate me,

89
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,496
because I'm the new Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

90
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:06,999
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

91
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,626
The North Pole is a real place.
You know that, right?

92
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:16,548
You want to get pizza later?

93
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,341
I think we should break up.

94
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,136
I still think about him
in the shower.

95
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:24,264
- Tell us everything.
- How'd it go, bud?

96
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:26,266
Where do I begin?

97
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,020
I'm not sure how to start this.

98
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,480
I think I need a drink.

99
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,647
Me, too.

100
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,650
Glen McKenna, neat.

101
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,527
Nice order.
Up top.

102
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,950
It's been 30 years.

103
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,981
And now you just show up
out of nowhere?

104
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:49,247
This is going to take me a minute.

105
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:51,291
Yeah. I understand.

106
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,765
By the way, hell of a tie.
Italian silk?

107
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,131
I love you.
I'm so glad we're best friends now.

108
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:02,193
Make a muscle.

109
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,489
Guys, my dad's awesome.

110
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:07,257
He's the mother of all fathers.

111
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:08,433
Check this out.

112
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,801
Back when I was a kid,
you were a roadie.

113
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:12,854
- Do you still do that?
- Not anymore.

114
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:16,945
Back in '83, I'm lugging amps
for The Stones through West Germany,

115
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:20,976
and their tour manager loses his arms,
bus-surfing through a tunnel.

116
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,405
Gnarly.

117
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:24,755
Long story short,

118
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:27,763
I've been managing tours ever since,

119
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:31,289
and that dude high-fives people
with his face now.

120
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:34,007
You're funny.

121
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,499
My dad's funny.

122
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,513
So, all these years,

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,112
there's this one question
I've been dying to ask him.

124
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,675
- Why did you abandon me?
- Why'd you wait so long?

125
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,386
You've hurt me before,
why should I trust you now?

126
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:49,369
Do you... get laid a lot?

127
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:51,434
Big-time.

128
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:55,655
Observe.

129
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,700
That took you five seconds.

130
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,311
Was it that long?

131
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,816
Life's too short for chatty chicks.

132
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:26,282
You're a master.

133
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,055
You are legen... wait for it...

134
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:30,493
daddy!

135
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,120
Legendaddy!

136
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:33,601
The man is a god.

137
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,729
And he's still out there,
living the dream.

138
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,118
So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow
with Bon Jovi.

139
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:40,900
I'll be on the road all the year.

140
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:42,860
That's cool.

141
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:47,156
You want to join me
for the tour's Asian leg?

142
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,494
This is going to be the second-most fun
I've ever had on an Asian leg.

143
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,707
We know you're psyched, but...

144
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:58,751
- be careful.
- What do you mean?

145
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,243
Well, this guy has flaked out
on your whole life.

146
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,506
He might be telling you
what you want to hear.

147
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,050
We just don't want
to see you get hurt.

148
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,099
First of all, Robin,

149
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,173
my dad could beat up your dad.

150
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,932
Second, you don't have to worry.
He's cool.

151
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,555
Now if you'll excuse me.

152
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:18,121
I have to go renew my passport,

153
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:20,606
and get a travel-sized rotating
Vietnamese Shame Wheel.

154
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,568
Don't ask, you're not ready.

155
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,865
I hope Barney's dad isn't pretending
to be something he's not,

156
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,332
That would make Jerry
a real chamma-leeon.

157
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,122
You have gaps, too, Lily.

158
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,790
You got nothing on me.

159
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:40,293
Can you toss me a beer?

160
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,919
Sure, honey.

161
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,883
You have terrible aim.

162
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:48,461
That's not true.

163
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,103
At our apartment,
you're the one who pees on the floor.

164
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:55,975
Barney's dad.

165
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,770
You're Barney's friends, right?

166
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:03,149
Aren't you supposed to be off
managing some tour in Australia?

167
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:04,644
What?

168
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,070
I'm a driving instructor
up in White Plains.

169
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,823
And I need your help.
Barney won't return my calls.

170
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:18,372
Barney won't return your calls?

171
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,708
He said you two
had an amazing night together.

172
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:22,585
That's not what happened.

173
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:25,322
I'm not sure how to start this.

174
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,632
I need a drink.

175
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,716
Me, too.

176
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:31,045
- Glen McKenna, neat.
- Milk, skim.

177
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:32,974
Milk?

178
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,224
You're taking it easy.
Crazy night?

179
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,474
I'll say.

180
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:40,520
Between you and me,
I had a lot of acid last night.

181
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,523
I think it was the chili dog.

182
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,844
I had to take four Tums.

183
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:48,454
I was up till, like, 9:30.

184
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,432
When I was a kid, you were a roadie.

185
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,999
You still do that?

186
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:58,324
I switched lanes years ago.

187
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:04,171
I should explain.
I'm a driving instructor.

188
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,167
Now you get it, right?

189
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,548
I get it.

190
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,802
But when I was a kid,
you were this total badass.

191
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,052
I know.

192
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,389
I was a real hard partier.

193
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,432
Now we're getting to the good stuff.

194
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:20,977
The drugs, the alcohol, the women...

195
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,112
- I was out of control.
- <i>Out of control</i>

196
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,620
So when your mom said
I couldn't see you anymore,

197
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:30,274
it was rock bottom for me.

198
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:33,373
I'm so sorry.

199
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,326
You ever bang Stevie Nicks?

200
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,373
Barney wasn't interested in my apology.
He just wanted me to be cool.

201
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,655
And I was so desperate
to connect with him,

202
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,087
I did something I'm not proud of.

203
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>I started bragging.</i>

204
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:52,666
I bet you didn't know this about me,

205
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,041
but I've published
two nonfiction books about Asparagus.

206
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:58,673
And one fiction.

207
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:03,811
I'm credited with inventing
the word "furgling."

208
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,662
It means fumbling for keys.

209
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:11,011
So then all the county fair
judges started chanting,

210
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,389
"More quiche! More quiche!"

211
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,549
I guess you could call me
the LeBron James of drapes.

212
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:25,448
I could tell he just wanted me
to be this big ladies' man,

213
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,876
so...

214
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:30,880
What a hottie, huh?

215
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,966
I'm sure you're a real player.

216
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,376
Big-time.

217
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,881
Observe.

218
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:50,016
Excuse me, that's my son over there.

219
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,559
I'm trying to reconnect
with him after 30 years.

220
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:56,275
Would you just write down
any seven numbers here,

221
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,865
so that I can impress him?

222
00:10:58,152 --> 00:10:59,659
Please, I'm desperate.

223
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,621
My God, you're a natural.

224
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,474
Think of the pickup plays
we can run as a father-son duo.

225
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,796
There's the "Father Knows Breast,"

226
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,966
there's the "Bush Dynasty,"
the "Lick Father, Lick Son."

227
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:17,427
I couldn't do that.

228
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,470
- Why?
- I have a family now.

229
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,072
That's my wife, Cheryl,

230
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,514
my daughter Carly, she's in college.

231
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,022
This is my son JJ.

232
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,855
I was hoping you could come over
to dinner sometime and meet them.

233
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,649
You're all wearing matching sweaters.
That's cute.

234
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:35,653
I gotta get going, Jerry, but...

235
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,489
This was great.
Glad we did this.

236
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,792
I made him wait
all these years for me and...

237
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:48,082
I'm just not the guy
he wanted me to be.

238
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,249
I know I don't deserve it, but...

239
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:53,755
I need another chance
to connect with my son.

240
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:58,468
We think you should
give him another chance.

241
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,971
That's the real reason
we're out here.

242
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,597
He lives ten minutes away.

243
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:05,808
- What?
- You're having dinner with him tonight.

244
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,852
No, I most certainly am not.

245
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:11,773
I met him. He's not my kind of bro
and that's that.

246
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,504
- It's not more than that?
- Get it through your heads.

247
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,862
I am never gonna
talk to my dad again.

248
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,116
I'm never gonna talk to my dad again.

249
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:25,147
But your dad is alive

250
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,372
and he lives just down the road.

251
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:34,504
- Fine, I'll go.
- Awesome. Lily, keys.

252
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:42,345
I'm literally 11 inches from you.

253
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,908
<i>And so Barney agreed
to give his dad one more chance.</i>

254
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,294
You must be Barney.
I'm Cheryl.

255
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,622
It's just so nice
to finally meet you.

256
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,241
I love that suit.

257
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,123
Thank you very much.

258
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:00,648
And I love your...

259
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:06,828
... coat.
I love your coat.

260
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:10,706
That's your coat, Barney.
I just took it from you.

261
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,690
Well, I do love it.

262
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:15,336
It's doing a nice job
covering up that chair.

263
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:19,392
Guess now we wait.

264
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:23,377
I got an idea how to pass the time.
A little trivia game.

265
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,472
Reindeer: real or fake?

266
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,950
I'm not an idiot.
Reindeer are obviously...

267
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,022
Yikes! I'm surrounded
by a bunch of dum-dums.

268
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,787
Good thing I don't have any gaps
in my knowledge.

269
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,439
I am perfect.

270
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,243
For the love of God, guys,
enough already.

271
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,536
What, baby?

272
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,539
You've been treating me with kid gloves
ever since my dad died.

273
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,623
That's not true.

274
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:55,001
- Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.
- I'm sorry.

275
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,086
I first noticed it at the bar.

276
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,881
Can you get me a mojito?

277
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,883
<i>Normally, you would've given me crap</i>

278
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,635
<i>for an hour about a voice crack
that pubescently girl-like,</i>

279
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,501
<i>but nothing.
So then I started to test you guys.</i>

280
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,975
<i>The Phantom Menace</i> is by far
the best <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

281
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:16,127
It ages well, that's the thing.

282
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,692
You guys like my new soul patch?

283
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,653
Righteous hair tab, brotha.

284
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:25,823
<i>And once I figured it out,
I started doing</i>

285
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:28,134
<i>crazy stuff
to see how far you'd let me go.</i>

286
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,865
This is Rex.

287
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,190
He's a possum.

288
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,499
I found him in the trash.

289
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:38,294
He lives with us now.

290
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:40,947
I love him.

291
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:45,063
We are living with a possum.

292
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,831
Rex is violent and he hates us.

293
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:51,764
But, baby, you just lost your dad.
None of us wants to upset you.

294
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:52,892
Please.

295
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,986
If you guys really want me to get over
the worst tragedy of my life,

296
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,941
I'm begging you, tear me a new one.

297
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,733
But not like Rex tried to
in my sleep last night.

298
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,710
JJ, dinner.

299
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,555
When I got your letter,
I dug this up.

300
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,801
You were probably
too young to remember,

301
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:12,537
but this is you, this is me,
and, of course, ZZ Top.

302
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:14,872
I do remember that.

303
00:15:15,358 --> 00:15:18,251
I climbed up on his lap and told him
what I wanted for Christmas.

304
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,547
I used to love taking you backstage.

305
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,687
You were the coolest little kid.

306
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,428
Hi.
It's great to finally meet you.

307
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:32,139
JJ, I'm talking to Dad right now.

308
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,600
Seriously,

309
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:35,720
it's time.

310
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:36,894
What are my gaps?

311
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,420
I guess maybe one gap you have is...

312
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:42,942
you can't wink.

313
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,158
Don't you think that
maybe we should go home

314
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:49,407
and... do the laundry?

315
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:55,413
<i>You can't swallow pills.</i>

316
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:00,543
<i>I got one.</i>

317
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,409
You think John Kennedy
and Jack Kennedy are the same person.

318
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:06,384
Right?

319
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,592
What?

320
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,553
So, Barney,

321
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,514
You have a pretty big job
with a bank?

322
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,431
I do.

323
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,395
I make a ton of money.

324
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:17,226
How much do you make, JJ?

325
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,645
I'm 11.

326
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,330
Now we all know you make excuses.

327
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:25,234
I was talking about money.

328
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,908
Actually, JJ has a job.
Tell him.

329
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,280
I got a paper route.

330
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:32,171
Good time to get into print media.

331
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:34,577
- Right, Dad?
- Good slam, Barney.

332
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,703
Jerry.

333
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,272
It's all good fun.

334
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,957
Just ribbing
among long lost brothers.

335
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,600
JJ's a heck of a basketball player.

336
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,785
You don't strike me
as the athletic type, Jayj.

337
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,110
Dad, check it.

338
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:56,062
Triceps.

339
00:16:57,823 --> 00:16:59,226
What gym do you go to?

340
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:00,895
Fourth period?

341
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,128
Sounds like you're having
your fourth period.

342
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:04,985
- Am I right, Dad?!
- Got him again.

343
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:08,611
Uh, maybe that's enough.

344
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,577
Why? JJ started it.
What does JJ even stand for anyway?

345
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,909
Jerky... Jerkface?

346
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,703
JJ stands for Jerome Jr.

347
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,593
Jerome Jr...

348
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:26,921
He's named after you.

349
00:17:29,941 --> 00:17:30,758
Excuse me.

350
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:36,806
I like having a brother.

351
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,101
You add too much water to oatmeal.

352
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,560
I drown the son of a bitch.

353
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,854
You consistently miss
at least one belt loop.

354
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,272
It's like I'm blind.

355
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,358
You're too old to ask
to see the cockpit.

356
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:51,696
Guys... my dad just died.

357
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:53,406
Honey.

358
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:55,737
No, I'm just kidding.
This is great.

359
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:57,368
I really, I really missed this.

360
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,707
What is going on?

361
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,792
- This is mine.
- I don't understand.

362
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,322
JJ gets a childhood, a dad,

363
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,745
a real family and> a basketball hoop?

364
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,299
No. I at least get the hoop.
I'm taking it with me.

365
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:13,801
Come down and talk to me.

366
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,222
Why? Why should I?
You're lame, okay?

367
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:19,140
You're just some lame suburban dad.

368
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,516
So why are you so mad?

369
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,804
If you were gonna be
some lame suburban dad,

370
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:24,979
why couldn't you have
been that for me?!

371
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,151
I know I screwed up.

372
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,778
"Screwed up" doesn't even
begin to describe...

373
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,284
I know, I know!

374
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,826
I want to fix this,
and I don't know how!

375
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,952
Tell me what I can do!
I'll do anything!

376
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,429
You're never gonna
get it down like that.

377
00:19:10,295 --> 00:19:14,320
Just put the pointy end
into the grooves.

378
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:18,949
That's it. Now turn it.

379
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,702
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

380
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,835
I have no good excuse, Barney.

381
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:31,545
It took me years

382
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,021
before I was even able
to look myself in the mirror

383
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:35,633
for the way I let you down.

384
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,386
It took courage
to send me that letter.

385
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:43,349
More courage than I've ever had.

386
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,533
I owe you a lifetime of apologies,
and I...

387
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:50,851
I just have no idea where to begin.

388
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,114
Can you help me with this?

389
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:05,207
Here, got it.

390
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,000
Look, if you...

391
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,833
ever feel like you're ready,

392
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:19,385
I'd love nothing more
than to be a part of your life.

393
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,654
Are you sure
you don't want to talk about it?

394
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,905
I'm fine.

395
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:44,285
Buddy?

396
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,079
You, still want
a basketball hoop out there?

397
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,796
I also really liked
your outdoor stripper pole idea.

398
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,753
You were right.

399
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,339
A kid needs a hoop.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
