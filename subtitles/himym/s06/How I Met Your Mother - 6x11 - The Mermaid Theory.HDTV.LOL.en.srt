<i>Kids, in the winter of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:05,897
<i>we had a new addition
to our little group-- Zoey.</i>

3
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:08,366
<i>Zoey was married to...
The Captain.</i>

4
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:10,768
Boys! Great to see you!

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:11,869
Looking smart.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,738
Have a wonderful time
tonight, okay?

7
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:16,140
Okay.

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,842
That man is terrifying.

9
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,344
Everything he said was nice,
but I am profoundly scared.

10
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:22,113
Keep smiling.
He can still see us.

11
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:23,347
(all murmuring)

12
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:25,283
<i>NARRATOR: There was
just something about him.</i>

13
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:28,019
<i>We couldn't put
our finger on it until...</i>

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,654
I figured it out!

15
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,790
I know what's so creepy
about The Captain.

16
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,724
Okay.

17
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:36,994
(all scream)
Yeah.

18
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,162
I snapped this
photo of him

19
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,664
last time he dropped off Zoey.

20
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,932
Observe.

21
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,034
The bottom half
of his face... is smiling.

22
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,702
LILY: Oh. Look,
he seems happy.

23
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:46,904
Seems like a nice guy.

24
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,005
(all murmur happily)

25
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,174
But the top half of his face...

26
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:50,908
(all gasp)

27
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:52,109
...wants to murder you!

28
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,111
Cheerful.

29
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:55,613
(all screaming)
Wants to murder you.

30
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:57,248
No. Cheerful.

31
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,983
(all scream)
Wants to murder you.

32
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:01,252
Now, hold on.
Let me ask him a question.

33
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:04,422
Captain,
what do you think of ice cream?

34
00:01:04,423 --> 00:01:05,756
Oh, he loves it!

35
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:07,758
Captain, what do you
think of rainy days?

36
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,027
(gasps) Whoa, he hates them.

37
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,530
Captain, quick question:

38
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,398
How do you feel about
the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.

39
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:15,600
Ooh.
Ooh.

40
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,470
What-What is that?

41
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,172
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

42
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:23,941
He hates that he loves them.

43
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,309
(all murmur):
Ah!

Hey, guys, Zoey just told me

49
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,894
about this great Frank Lloyd
Wright retrospective tonight.

50
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,095
Who's in?

51
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:46,130
Sorry, I'm, uh, I...

52
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:47,932
I- I don't know,
washing my hair.

53
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:48,699
Running the water.

54
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,800
Holding the towel.

55
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,935
And I'll be home

56
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,203
trying to get over the fact

57
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,038
that no one invited me
to the big hair washing party.

58
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,340
All right, fine.
Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.

59
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,209
Oh, wait.
Just the two of you?

60
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,111
Tread lightly, Mosby.

61
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:01,045
Any time

62
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,346
a single guy hangs out

63
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,481
with a married woman,

64
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,283
there are rules
that must be followed.

65
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:06,951
Rule number one...

66
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,452
Don't use
the husband's condoms.

67
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,087
That's just rude.

68
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,657
Rule number one:

69
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:15,593
don't go anywhere
that has candles.

70
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,962
Excuse me, Captain,
how do you feel

71
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,998
about Ted and Zoey having
an intimate chat by candlelight?

72
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,166
Mm-hmm...

73
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,301
(yelling)

74
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:25,636
It'll be the last dinner
they ever have.

75
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,939
Rule number two:

76
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,373
No sharing food.
Hmm.

77
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:31,943
In fact, anything involving
saliva is off-limits.

78
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,578
Toothbrushes,
thermometers, lipstick.

79
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,746
Well, if I can't share
her lipstick,

80
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:36,881
there's really no point
in even going.

81
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:39,450
And the most
important rule of all...

82
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,119
Lubricant is public
property. (Robin groans)

83
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,853
Please.

84
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,388
No lying to the spouse

85
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,490
about anything you do.

86
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:47,625
Why would anyone lie?

87
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,759
Look, Zoey and I
are just friends.

88
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,061
If there was anything more
than that,

89
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:51,262
I wouldn't hang out with her.

90
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:53,164
Lily's right, Ted.
Once you're married,

91
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,498
it's very hard to be friends

92
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:57,034
with a single person of the
opposite sex. ROBIN: Yeah.

93
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,502
Unless you're old friends,
which is why

94
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,504
I can hang out
with Marshall whenever I want.

95
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:01,605
Right, Marsh Madness?

96
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:02,974
No doubt, Robo Cop.

97
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:05,743
You two never hang out alone.

98
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:07,712
You just made up those nicknames
right now.

99
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:08,980
I guess it's true.

100
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,148
You and I never really
hang out alone.

101
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,718
Well, let's. Let's have dinner
together, just the two of us.

102
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,986
Oh! Sweet.

103
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,921
No candles.

104
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:18,990
BOTH:
No candles.

105
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,125
Lily, I guess that leaves
just you and me. Want to hang?

106
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:23,160
<i>NARRATOR: And then Lily
said something to Barney</i>

107
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,129
<i>that insulted every fiber
of his being.</i>

108
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,564
Nah.

109
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,065
(gasps)

110
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,534
<i>NARRATOR: Wait. No. It had
to be more than just, "Nah."</i>

111
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:31,669
<i>Oh, I think she said...</i>

112
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,906
You're a big...
stupid octopus head!

113
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:37,108
(gasps)

114
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:38,542
<i>NARRATOR:
No, that doesn't make sense.</i>

115
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:41,145
<i>Okay, hang on.
What did she say?</i>

116
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:45,916
<i>She said, um, uh...</i>

117
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,819
<i>To be honest kids, I'm having
a little trouble remembering</i>

118
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,521
<i>exactly what their fight
was about.</i>

119
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,156
<i>Hey, it was 20 years ago!</i>

120
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,324
<i>I'll remember.</i>

121
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,759
<i>Anyway, the next night...</i>

122
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,228
Well, Lily,
you were right.

123
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,531
Something weird happened
with Zoey last night.

124
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,834
(phone plays "Anchors Aweigh")
Oh, that's the Captain.

125
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,703
Yes, I call my husband
The Captain,

126
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,906
but that is the only concession
I make to his seafaring ways.

127
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:10,341
Hang on.

128
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:11,709
Ahoy.

129
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,445
I'm just out with friends.

130
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,313
Friends. Plural.

131
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,549
Like-Like there was more
than one of me.

132
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,784
Ew! Ew!

133
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:22,553
She lied
to her husband? Uh-oh.

134
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,355
So, what did you do?

135
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:27,792
Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say
you were out with friends?

136
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:29,927
Yeah. The Captain's
on his way home from Milan.

137
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,595
He can get a little jealous
sometimes,

138
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:33,697
so I didn't want
to make him worry.

139
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,499
Is that okay?

140
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,368
It's totally okay.

141
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,737
It's not okay! I didn't
really think it was okay!

142
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,373
Pur-leez! You lie to
your husband all the time.

143
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,642
"Uh, uh, that shirt
looks great on you""

144
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:46,444
"I love your mom""

145
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,879
"I never fantasize about
Barney when we're doing it""

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,415
Sound familiar, Pinocchio?

147
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,683
(scoffs)

148
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:53,884
What's wrong
with this shirt?

149
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:56,053
TED:
Lily, ruling.

150
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:57,388
Do I have to stop

151
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,923
hanging out with Zoey?

152
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,025
No, you just need
to spend time

153
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,094
with her
and The Captain together.

154
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,929
If you're friends
with the both of them,

155
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,363
then there's not a problem.

156
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:08,766
Actually, I do have a standing
invitation from The Captain

157
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,235
to go for a ride with them
on his boat.

158
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:14,238
Great. So go make nice
with Captain Creepy,

159
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,439
and problem solved.

<i>He's just staring at me!</i>

180
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,653
<i>She's just staring at me!</i>

181
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,922
<i>It's making me nervous.</i>

182
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:06,924
<i>Great, now my left eye
is twitching.</i>

183
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,559
<i>Marshall, it's cool.</i>

184
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,227
<i>She doesn't see it.</i>

185
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:13,264
<i>What the hell's going on
with his eye?</i>

186
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:15,499
<i>Am I supposed to not talk
about that?</i>

187
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,069
<i>Great, now
my right eye is doing it.</i>

188
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,340
Can I get you two some drinks?

189
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,209
Lots of drinks.
Oh, so many drinks.

190
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,112
<i>NARRATOR: That same night, Barney
and Lily were still fighting</i>

191
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,647
<i>about, um... something.</i>

192
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:31,849
<i>Or was it that other thing?</i>

193
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,284
Barney.
Save it, Lily.

194
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,553
I am still mad at you for...

195
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:38,656
something, and for
that other thing.

196
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:41,125
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

197
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,626
But let's be honest.

198
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:44,828
You've been super
sensitive lately.

199
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,964
(crying):
No, I haven't!

200
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:49,366
God, how can you say that?!

201
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,168
Watch out!
(yells)

202
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,404
NARRATOR:
Wait. They were on the street.

203
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,940
Watch out!
Oh!

204
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,909
Wow. Thanks, Lily.

205
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,278
You saved me.

206
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,047
You saved us.

207
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:06,984
Look, I know
you didn't mean

208
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:10,087
whatever it was
you said that made me so mad.

209
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:12,323
I think I probably didn't.

210
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:15,793
<i>NARRATOR: And just like
that, the fight was over.</i>

211
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,762
<i>You know, kids,
friendship is funny sometimes.</i>

212
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,130
Wait.

213
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:23,133
I still can't resist
getting one last shot in.

214
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:24,602
(gasps)

215
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:27,938
<i>NARRATOR: Like I said, the
fight was just getting started.</i>

216
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,651
Hi, Captain.

217
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:42,019
The Captain.

218
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,587
Captain.

219
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,855
Ahoy, Ted!

220
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,056
Excellent to see you.

221
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:47,725
Ah, you, too.
Uh, where's Zoey?

222
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:49,026
Well, I'm afraid

223
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:51,195
she's feeling a little
under the weather.

224
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,263
Looks like it's just

225
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,831
you, me

226
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,033
and six hours
in frigid international waters.

227
00:07:56,034 --> 00:08:00,938
Or we could stay on dry land,
hang out with some... witnesses.

228
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,607
(laughs)
You're a hoot.

229
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,910
I've been looking
forward to this.

230
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:12,316
For a very long time.

231
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:14,985
Well, anchors aweigh!

232
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:17,721
<i>NARRATOR: Kids, here's
one thing I do remember.</i>

233
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:20,724
<i>I was pretty sure
I was going to die that night.</i>

234
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:27,678
Mmm.

235
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,213
Mmm.

236
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:34,051
You know, I had this really
boring poetry class in college.

237
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:35,385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:38,288
You were just thinking that
this dinner is really boring.

239
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,124
That's what made you think of
your boring class in college.

240
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,160
What?! What? No! No!
No, no, no.

241
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,695
Marshall, no. No. I...

242
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:48,799
<i>I just saw that board
of specials, and I thought,</i>

243
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,500
you know what sucks?

244
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,735
Being bored.

245
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:52,903
Which I am not.

246
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:58,075
So that clears that... right up.

247
00:08:58,076 --> 00:08:59,443
Robin, I'm an attorney.

248
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,611
(sighs)

249
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:02,145
Fine. This night's
a little awkward.

250
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,982
I guess it's 'cause we never
hang out alone together.

251
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,083
Why is that?

252
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:08,418
It's 'cause
of The Mermaid Theory.

253
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:13,056
<i>Two years ago, I had just hired
a new assistant at GNB.</i>

254
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:18,528
So, who's the eye broccoli?

255
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,897
Okay, that's Iris,
my new assistant.

256
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:23,066
And yes, she's a little plain,

257
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,869
but I'm married, so that's good.

258
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,204
Mark my words, Marshall.

259
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:30,173
Someday you will find Iris
so excruciatingly attractive,

260
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:33,844
you won't be able to look her
directly in the boobs.

261
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:40,450
I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

262
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:43,987
Marshall, do you know how
the myth of mermaids came to be?

263
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:45,455
I'm sorry. Myth?

264
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,824
It was 300 years ago.

265
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:50,594
<i>Sailors stuck at sea
would get desperate</i>

266
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:51,895
<i>for female companionship.</i>

267
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:55,599
<i>It got so bad
that, eventually,</i>

268
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,403
<i>the manatees out in the water
started to look like...</i>

269
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:01,538
<i>beautiful women.</i>

270
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,975
<i>Mermaids.</i>

271
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,979
Let's go get some tail!

272
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,983
Oh.

273
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:18,422
You see, every woman, no matter
how initially repugnant,

274
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:21,458
has a mermaid clock--
the time it takes

275
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:24,127
for you to realize
you want to bone her.

276
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:27,097
Sure, today you see Iris
as a manatee.

277
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,299
But she ain't gonna
stay that way.

278
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,838
Marshall, your secretary's
mermaid clock starts right now.

279
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,406
(clock ticking)

280
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,276
<i>MARSHALL: And it took one year,
three months, and 16 days,</i>

281
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:41,378
<i>but eventually...</i>

282
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,213
(alarm bell dings)

283
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,354
(panting)

284
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:51,722
D'oh!

285
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:53,423
Told you.

286
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:55,092
The Mermaid Theory.

287
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,259
It's a thing.

288
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,928
You owe me 500 bucks.

289
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,162
Did we bet on this?

290
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,198
Let's say yes.

291
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:04,101
And that's why we never
hang out alone? Yes.

292
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,870
As Lily's best friend, you are
the last person on the planet

293
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,505
o's allowed
to turn into a mermaid.

294
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,673
Wait, does that mean

295
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,608
that I'm a manatee right now?

296
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:16,346
Big-time manatee.

297
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:19,850
What were those
sailors thinking?

298
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:22,986
Huh. I don't know.

299
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:27,124
Being out at sea can do
crazy things to a man.

300
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,993
Vast, the sea.

301
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:32,028
Deep.

302
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,264
Endless.

303
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:37,667
Going around for miles.

304
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:42,305
You could scream and scream,
and not a soul would hear you.

305
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:45,342
Listen to this.

306
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:46,510
(screams)

307
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:47,677
Help!

308
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:49,346
Somebody help me!

309
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:52,082
I'm trapped on a boat
with a madman!

310
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,717
Help!

311
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:58,388
See? Nothing.

<i>Okay, calm down, Teddy.</i>

316
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:07,230
<i>He's not jealous.</i>

317
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,232
He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.

318
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,534
So, Ted,

319
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:15,372
I noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with Zoey.

320

323
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:25,315
Seriously? I step away for
five seconds, and you eat

324

all my onion rings?

325
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:29,352
No surprise there.

What's that supposed to mean?

327
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:33,590
Are you calling me fat?

328
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:36,359
If there is one thing
you never do,

329
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,463
it is call a woman fat
right to her face!

330
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:41,531
<i>Wait. Barney's not a woman.</i>

331

00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:47,838
<i>Lily was hurt by Barney.</i>

333
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,905

Hey, silly question.

00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:39,189
What are our exact
nautical coordinates?

356
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,824
How now?

357
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,859
Oh, bother.

358
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,062
(sighs) Well...

359
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:48,398
she's a goner.

360
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:52,335
By now, the icy tide
has already dropped

361
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:55,539
its core temperature
to near freezing.

362
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,108
And down it goes.

363
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:00,310
Now it's at 50 meters.

364
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:03,780
Complete crushing blackness.

365
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:05,482
100 meters.

366
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,183
The pressure is so intense,

367
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:10,153
the keys are popping
right out of its head.

368
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,756
Head?
200 meters.

369
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:16,293
No one will ever find
its mangled remains,

370
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,728
save for the crustacea

371
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:22,332
that feed off
its lifeless husk.

372
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,434
Can you hear me now?

373
00:14:24,435 --> 00:14:28,838
No. Because you're
on the bottom of the sea.

374
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:32,576
Well, I got a big
morning, so...

375
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:35,378
Dry cleaners, bank, you
know, so... Ted, it's time.

376
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,580
(whimpers)

377
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,815
I have something
for you.

378
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,650
Wait here.

379
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:46,556
<i>Okay, you got to swim
for it, Mosby.</i>

380
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:48,391
<i>Man versus sea.</i>

381
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:49,526
<i>You can do this.</i>

382
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:51,127
<i>You didn't get
a "Good Effort" ribbon</i>

383
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:52,696
<i>from the Shaker Heights
JCC Swim Camp</i>

384
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,598
<i>because you don't
have what it takes.</i>

385
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,932
Found it.

386
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:56,967
Zoey told me

387
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:58,802
you're a scotch drinker.

388
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:01,471
I bought this special
for tonight.

389
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:04,074
<i>And just as I started
to realize that maybe</i>

390
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,810
<i>I wasn't in danger after all,
we hit a bump.</i>

391
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,411
Whoa!

392
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:10,013
(splash)

393
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:12,048
Ted?

394
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,058
that if you spend

395
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,594
too much time alone with me,
I'll turn into a mermaid?

396
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:22,564
Yes. I mean, sure, right now,
you're bald and leathery

397
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,532
ancovered in
a thick layer of blubber...

398
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,167
Am I blushing or...?

399
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:29,370
...but at some point, my stupid
male brain will transform you

400
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:33,174
into a foxy fish-babe singin'

401
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:35,276
"Part of Your World"
to my pants.

402
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:39,113
Okay, even if that happens, is
there any way to un-mermaid me?

403
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,049
I asked Barney the same thing.

404
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:46,287
Once mermaid-ified,
there's only one way

405
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,923
a woman can go back to being
unattractive again,

406
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:50,725
but it's pretty gruesome.

407
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,227
Death?

408
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:54,662
Worse. Pregnancy.

409
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,664
If a baby's on board that train,

410
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,067
it is headed straight back
to Manatee City...

411
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:02,003
where the grass ain't green
and the girls ain't pretty.

412
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:03,538
Pregnancy?

413
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,940
Mm-hmm.
Once a mermaid gets pregnant,

414
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:08,676
she becomes a manatee again.

415
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,712
Never thought
I'd say that sentence.

416
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:11,980
<i>Wait! That's it!</i>

417
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:14,215
That's what Barney and Lily were
fighting about!

418
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,416
The Mermaid Theory!

419
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,652
But their argument didn't happen
at the same time

420
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:20,788
as all this other stuff.
I'm literally in the wrong year!

421
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,458
It happened much, much later
when Lily was...

422
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,592
<i>pregnant.</i>

423
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,594
Well, Lily, I guess it's
just you and me.

424
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:27,595
You wanna hang?

425
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:28,730
Nah.

426
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,031
(gasps)

427
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,232
Whenever we're alone, you spend

428
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,635
the whole time undressing me
with your eyes.

429
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:35,303
You even take off my shoes.

430
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:38,406
High heels chafe my shoulders.

431
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:40,375
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore.

432
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,810
Ever since you got pregnant,
you're just a big fat manatee.

433
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,279
(gasps)

434
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,215
Well, you're a big...

435
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,183
stupid octopus face!

436
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:53,288
<i>That was it! I remember now!</i>

437
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:55,890
Wow. Thanks, Barney.

438
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,358
You saved me.

439
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:01,396
You saved us.

440
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:04,065
If there's one thing
you never do,

441
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,768
it's call a woman "fat"
right to her face!

442
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,036
I'm sorry, Lily.

443
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:10,638
Hey, you want to see
a magic trick?

444
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:14,842
Oh...

445
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:17,312
You're a jerk.

446
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:19,714
(Barney chuckles)

447
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:20,949
Hey. Hey, wait.

448
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,451
Come on. I was kid...
Wait, wait, wait!

449
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,653
There's another addendum
to The Mermaid Theory.

450
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:28,923
A pregnant woman who's become
a manatee can become

451
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,592
a mermaid again
through one simple act.

452
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:31,593
What's that?

453
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:33,861
Breast-feeding. Hot.

454
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:34,862
Really?

455
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:36,531
Really.

456
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,866
When those things swell up to
three times their normal size...

457
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,368
so do I.

458
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:43,071
That's so sweet!

459
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,474
<i>See kids?
Told you I'd get it!</i>

460
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:50,278
Okay, now we're even!

461
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,247
<i>Yeah, that's the ending
to a whole other story.</i>

462
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:55,283
<i>We'll get there.</i>

463
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,986
So you really thought
I was gonna kill you?

464
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:00,622
Well... ish.

465
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:02,123
Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous.

466
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:05,393
If I wanted to kill you, I'd
invite you to my hunting lodge.

467
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:08,329
It's far more remote,
and I wouldn't have

468
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,200
to worry about you turning up in
some nosy fisherman's net.

469
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:13,534
See? It's stuff like that.

470
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:15,003
Why-why do you talk that way?

471
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:17,105
Oh, I'm just jesting for sport.

472
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:22,410
See, sometimes I don't
bond as well

473
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,312
with Zoey's younger friends.

474
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,914
But I know she really likes you.

475
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,752
I was hoping that maybe
we could be buddies.

476
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:33,721
We can.

477
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:35,723
We can be buddies.

478
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:37,325
Just not on a boat.

479
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:38,626
Fair enough.

480
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:39,927
The hunting lodge it is.

481
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,164
Ho-ho-ho!

482
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:46,200
(slurring): You know, once we
stopped trying to have a conversation

483
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,236
and just focused on
the drinking...

484
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:49,637
I had fun.

485
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:50,738
Yeah, me, too.

486
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,640
<i>And then a terrible thing
happened.</i>

487
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:54,108
<i>Marshall's beer goggles
kicked in</i>

488
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:56,944
<i>and his very drunk mind started
to see...</i>

489
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:03,284
No... No, no!

490
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,952
No! No,

491
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:06,254
don't turn!

492
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,790
Uh-oh.

493
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,625
I don't feel so good.

494
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:14,962
(vomits)

495
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:19,133
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
I am, I am so sorry!

496
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:23,037
Oh! You must think
I'm totally disgusting.

497
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,339
I really do.

498
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,011
<i>And from that moment on</i>

499
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,112
<i>Marshall never worried</i>

500
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:32,780
<i>about Robin becoming
a mermaid again,</i>

501
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:35,216
<i>and the two of them were
closer than ever.</i>

502
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,751
There you go.

503
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,219
Hey, Ted.

504
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,654
Hey. You feeling
better?

505
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,989
I have a confession
to make.

506
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,059
I wasn't really sick.

507
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,893
You weren't?

508
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:46,894
I'm sorry.

509
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,329
I was just feeling guilty

510
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,131
that I lied
to The Captain and...

511
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:53,601
I don't know, I just thought it
would be good

512
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,636
if you two spent some time
together.

513
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:56,904
I get it.

514
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,005
And you were right.

515
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,507
He's a nice guy.

516
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:01,776
I mean, he can be
a little scary.

517
00:20:01,777 --> 00:20:04,979
Yeah, he gets a little murder-y
when he's nervous.

518
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,748
Yeah, he's a creepy dude.

519
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:08,249
But I like him.

520
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,485
And I just want to make sure

521
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:12,386
you and I hanging out

522
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,956
doesn't, you know,
cross any lines.

523
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:16,357
Me, too.

524
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:19,093
I mean, if either one of us had
even the slightest hint

525
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,562
of feelings for the other,
we shouldn't hang out.

526
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:23,331
You don't, do you?

527
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,833
No. Do you?

528
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,735
No.

529
00:20:28,537 --> 00:20:30,972
(clock ticking)

530
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,727
Still no sign
of land.

531
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:41,097
It's been 243 days
since we've seen

532
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,132
another living soul.

533
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:55,611
What are you looking at?
