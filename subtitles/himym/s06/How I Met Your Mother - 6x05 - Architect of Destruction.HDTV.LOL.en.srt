00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,761
Kids, in the fall of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:04,295
<i>I was designing
the new headquarters</i>

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,597
<i>for Goliath National Bank,</i>

4
00:00:05,598 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>which meant
working side by side</i>

5
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,800
<i>with your Uncle Barney.</i>

6
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:09,901
I love your idea

7
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:11,203
about a giant
rooftop ring of fire

8
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:12,571
you can jump through
with a motorcycle,

9
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:14,472
but I tweaked it
slightly and...

10
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,157
This is still
super bad-ass.

11
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:20,362
It's now a patio garden
where you can bring a nice bag lunch.

12
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:22,663
Sick.

13
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:23,948
Yeah.

14
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,032
Dude.

15
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:28,285
Working together
is gonna be legen...

16
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,537
Wait for it.

17
00:00:29,538 --> 00:00:31,822
I'll send you an inter-office
memo with the rest

18
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,657
'cause we freakin'
work together!

19
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,376
<i>Everything was going great.</i>

20
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:37,511
<i>That is, right up
until Barney said...</i>

21
00:00:37,512 --> 00:00:38,762
Oh, big news.

22
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:40,631
The board finally settled on
a site for the building.

23
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,017
<i>It was the site
of The Arcadian,</i>

24
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:44,969
<i>one of New York's grandest
old hotels.</i>

25
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,022
<i>In its heyday, it was the New
York home to kings and queens.</i>

26
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:49,223
<i>But lately...</i>

27
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:53,477
<i>...mostly just queens.</i>

28
00:00:53,478 --> 00:00:55,062
Hi, handsome.

29
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:56,864
Lookin' for a date?

30
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,399
Uh, no, thank you.

31
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:03,070
Still got it.

32
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,522
Barney, we have to talk.

33
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,707
Sure. What's up?

34
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,775
Excuse me,
Mr. Stinson.

35
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,326
Not now, Trish!

36
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,912
But there's an urgent
memo for Mr. Mosby.

37
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,635
"Dary."
Legendary!

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,088
So, what's on your mind?

39
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,642
I can't design the building.

40
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:35,712

41
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:39,657
Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:41,725
Oh, baby. No, no.

43
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,695
Not the slipper socks
with the rubber soles.

44
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:47,031
I work so hard
to-to set the mood,

45
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:48,315
and-and when I see those,

46
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,367
I feel the egg go

47
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:52,419
right back up my Fallopian tube.

48
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,039
Baby, these satin sheets
are slippery.

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,041
Papa needs traction.
Traction?

50
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,125
As you know,

51
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:00,010
Papa likes
to get down with enthusiasm.

52
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:01,879
Please stop calling
yourself "Papa."

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,130
And without traction,

54
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,015
Papa's likely to boogie himself
right out of bed.

55
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:06,450
It's either these
or soccer cleats.

56
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:11,055
Hey, so I talked to Robin.

57
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:13,273
I guess she and Max
hooked up last night.

58
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:15,225
<i>Kids, as you may remember,
Max was a friend of Marshall's</i>

59
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:16,510
<i>from law school...</i>

60
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,163
<i>with whom Robin was really
starting to hit it off.</i>

61
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,931
Nice! I love that guy.

62
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,985
Max is both his name
and his level of awesomeness.

63
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:25,986
Yeah. He's a sweet guy.

64
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,738
She feels really
comfortable with him.

65
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,156
They bonded over hockey.

66
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,824
I guess he has a small penis,

67
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:32,576
but they want to
double-date next weekend.

68
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:35,295
Why would you tell me that?

69
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,131
So you'll clear your schedule.

70
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,832
No! The other part!

71
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,467
Oh, the small penis thing?

72
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:41,785
Ah! Don't! Stop saying that!

73
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,286
Why do you keep saying that?
You...

74
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,588
I don't want to know that.

75
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,090
I'm not going to be able
to look the guy in the eye.

76
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,976
I'm certainly not going
to be able to call him "Max."

77
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,310
That's insane.

78
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,429
I mean, just because you
know Max has a small penis...

79
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,349
Just don't!

80
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,834
You're kidding me.

81
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,135
I'm sorry. I can't do this

82
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,070
if it means tearing down
The Arcadian.

83
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,739
It's an architectural landmark.

84
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,640
Plus, people live there.

85
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,526
How does GNB plan to get
hundreds of residents

86
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:06,643
to just up and leave?

87
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,162
Snakes.
Did you just say "snakes"?

88
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:10,364
I don't recall saying "snakes""

89
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:14,168
Ted, I know you love crappy
old stuff no one cares about.

90
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,254
But I'm gonna give you
four words to live by:

91
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:21,008
New is always better.

92
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,543
New is always better?

93
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:24,745
You know who's
a million times hotter

94
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,714
than the hottest girl
I've ever slept with?

95
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:30,350
Her okay-looking friend
I haven't seen naked.

96
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,685
Why?

97
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,154
Because new is always better.

98
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,540
Mm-hmm? And this theory
applies to everything?

99
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,524
Everything.

100
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:38,459
So, those new

101
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,843
<i>Star Wars movies...</i>

102
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,528
Those are better
than the old ones?

103
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,448
Yeah. The first three
barely mention

104
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,401
the intricacies
of intergalactic trade law.

105
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:49,470
And when you're
at a Guns n' Roses concert,

106
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:52,039
you're like, "Yeah, yeah,
Paradise City, whatever.

107
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,525
When are they gonna rock me
some Chinese Democracy"?

108
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,579
Axl's really matured
as a songwriter, Ted.

109
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,231
Wendy! I'd like to buy
my friend a drink.

110
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:02,583
What's your oldest Scotch?

111
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:05,702
Glenmckenna, aged 30 years
in oak casks.

112
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,653
Amazing.

113
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:08,088
And what's your newest scotch?

114
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:11,508
Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch.

115
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:13,510
Don't let it touch your skin.

116
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,480
Your call, buddy.

117
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,269
A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's
Grape Scotch sounds lovely.

118
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,188
Lots of ice.

119
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:26,740
New is always better, Ted!

120
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:27,825
That's a rule.

121
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:29,326
Just like bigger
is always better!

122
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,495
Pfft. That's not true.

123
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,614
Uh, sometimes smaller is better.

124
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:36,033
"Hey, look how big
my cell phone is!"

125
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,418
You don't hear people say that.

126
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:39,920
No. You want
something compact

127
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:42,673
and efficient that fits
comfortably in your pocket,

128
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:45,592
and I think Max
is just a great guy.

129
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:46,794
Lily told you.

130
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:47,795
Told him what?

131
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:48,796
Max has a small penis.

132
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,966
How can you speak
of such things?

133
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,134
Girls talk about everything.

134
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,269
Size, shape,

135
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,137
left or right
leaning orientation...

136
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:59,106
Length, resemblance to
a historical figure,

137
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,541
such as Winston Churchill...

138
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:01,775
Yes, that's one of you.

139
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:03,143
Girth, grooming...

140
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:05,529
How can you speak
of such things?

141
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,763
You're kidding.

142
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,366
Barney, every time I mention
a woman you don't know,

143
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,618
the first thing
you say is, "Boobs?"

144
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:14,538
Not the complete sentence,
"Does she have big boobs?"

145
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:15,989
Which also would not be great.

146
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,457
Just: "Boobs?"

147
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,493
I do not do that.

148
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,544
My friend Lori from work...

149
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:22,296
Boobs? Damn it.

150
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:23,947
But... seriously.

151
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,249
Boobs?

152
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,333
So why is it okay

153
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,668
for guys to talk about boobs,

154
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,219
but the moment we
bring up a topic

155
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,671
like Max's small penis...

156
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:34,224
I'm gonna pretend this
conversation never happened.

157
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:37,811
Impossible. Max's penis is stuck
in my brain like a splinter.

158
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,397
Like a splinter-sized splinter.

159
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:42,632
Speaking of
disappointing weenies...

160
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,434
Ted, tell them what you told me

161
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:47,637
I want to ask the board at GNB

162
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,639
to move the site
for the new headquarters

163
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,474
so we don't have to tear
down a classic old building.

164
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,026
I still don't get this.

165
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:55,696
Why, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

166
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:57,631
do you want to ruin...

167
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:59,683
Wait a minute.

168
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:02,336
Who's the girl?

169
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:04,154
- Duh. 
- Of course there's a girl.

170
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,422
What? I...

171
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,391
There's no g-girl.

172
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:09,092
Why would you even...

173
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:12,346
Her name is Zoey.

174
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,630
Boobs?

175
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,837
Beautiful building, right?

176
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,807
Look, mister, you
are very convincing,

177
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:26,276
and I am very flattered.

178
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:28,011
Confused, even.

179
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,062
But I'm not looking...

180
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:31,415
I'm not a drag queen.

181
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,651
But you definitely have me
rethinking this eye shadow.

182
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,536
Not only is she funny,

183
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,872
hot and genetically female,

184
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,574
but get this...

185
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:44,044
Look at the Palladian windows,
the rusticated stonework,

186
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,046
the marble cornices...

187
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,582
She's an architecture nerd!

188
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,033
A hot architecture nerd!

189
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,535
That's the dream!

190
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,420
Whose dream?

191
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,505
We wound up talking for hours.

192
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:58,592
I love how old parts
of the city are.

193
00:06:58,593 --> 00:06:59,776
Hmm.

194
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,478
It makes me feel
connected to history.

195
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,014
Old is always better.
I can't wait to be old.

196
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,132
Me, too.

197
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,683
You can wear
elastic everything.

198
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:09,152
Your lipstick doesn't have
to stay inside the lines.

199
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:11,438
You can shoplift and pretend
you're just confused.

200
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,108
You could nap anywhere.
Uh-huh.

201
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,059
Even while driving.

202
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,577
It's gonna be great.

203
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,896
I can't wait to be all run-down
and weathered and wrinkly.

204
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:24,034
Well, I'd say you got
a pretty long wait.

205
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:26,286
That's sweet.

206
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:27,921
It would be sweeter
if you hadn't thought

207
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:31,425
I was a tranny before,
but it's still sweet.

208
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,261
Oh, Ted, that's so romantic.

209
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:35,679
I want to fill a pillowcase

210
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,015
with dead batteries
and beat you with it.

211
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,599
Hey, Ted,

212
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,051
can I ask you something?

213
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,636
Anything.

214
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,809
Will you sign this petition?

215
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,995
"Save The Arcadian""

216
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:54,147
We are gonna stop the bastards
at Goliath National Bank

217
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:55,565
from demolishing it.

218
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,802
Will you support us?

219
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,822
And you said...?

220
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:04,474
Where do I sign?

221
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,944
Hmm.

222
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,813
Grape scotch.
Not bad.

223
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:15,748
Ted, you only think The
Arcadian needs to be saved

224
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,700
because some pretty
girl thinks that.

225
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:19,068
And seriously...

226
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:19,869
Boobs?

227
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,421
This isn't about the girl.

228
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:22,839
It's about the building.

229
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,308
And what did this "Zoey" say

230
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:27,410
when she found out
that you're the one

231
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:29,245
tearing down her
beloved Arcadian?

232
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:32,665
That you, Ted Mosby, are the
Architect Of Destruction?

233
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,850
Whoa!

234
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:35,819
Sweet wrestling name alert.

235
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,937
Well...

236
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:41,090
Uh, it's a... it's a
funny thing about that...

237
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,859
So what do you do, Ted?

238
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,561
I'm a veterinarian.

239
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,729
What? I panicked!

240
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,432
This whole Arcadian
thing is classic Mosby.

241
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:52,101
Changing your personality
to fit some girl.

242
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:54,954
I don't do that.

243
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:58,124
Well, off to meet Steph.

244
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,828
We're adrenaline junkies!

245
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:07,783
Penelope is taking me to
the Battle of Gettysburg.

246
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:10,970
We're gonna eat squirrel!

247
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,912
Look, she's really hot, okay?

248
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:24,267
Aww!
Come on! Come on!

249
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:26,486
We all change a little
for whoever we're into.

250
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:28,655
Barney pretended
to be a rabbi to get laid.

251
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:31,658
Asian girls love
them some Jews.

252
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:33,076
And Marshall never
would've listened

253
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,827
to The Indigo Girls
if it weren't for Lily.

254
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,330
Um, I think you got that
backwards there, Chief.

255
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:40,283
And you're welcome.

256
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:41,817
The point is,
you weren't pretending

257
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,503
to like the Indigo Girls
for the other person.

258
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:46,422
You realized you liked them
because of the other person.

259
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,875
Just like me, Zoey
and The Arcadian.

260
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,295
Did GNB really put snakes
in The Arcadian?

261
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,113
No.

262
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:55,798
Technically, they were eggs.

263
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,351
Did you just say "eggs"?
I don't recall saying "eggs."

264
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:01,604
So I walk into my boss's office

265
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:02,872
and suddenly I realize,

266
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:05,692
"Holy crap, I'm about to quit""

267
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,009
Small penis.</i>

268
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,778
<i>You have a small penis.</i>

269
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,015
<i>Oh, that's super interesting,
but you have a small penis.</i>

270
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,316
<i>Damn it, Marshall!</i>

271
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:15,235
<i>Okay. Okay.
Think of any two words</i>

272
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:17,520
other than "small" or "penis."

273
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:19,405
<i>Got it: small penis.</i>

274
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:20,573
<i>Damn it!</i>

275
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,408
Yeah, I-I think it is so cool

276
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,026
that you started
your own law firm.

277
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:27,797
Well, right now it's
a pretty small practice.

278
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,499
Hey, hey.

279
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,751
I bet it's not that small.

280
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:33,636
Bro, it's...

281
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:35,388
pretty small.

282
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:36,923
Yeah, but, uh,
you know what they say.

283
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:39,008
The important thing is-is
how you use it, you know?

284
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,094
"The motion of the ocean."
That whole thing.

285
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,929
He said it's small, Marshall,
and everybody's fine with that.

286
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,547
Let's just move on.

287
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:48,268
I'm just saying that I bet
it's bigger than he thinks.

288
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:50,019
And thick.

289
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:52,722
Nah.
Everything about it is tiny.

290
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:55,908
The office is tiny.
The conference room is tiny.

291
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:57,910
Plus, I got a very small staff.

292
00:10:57,911 --> 00:10:59,729
Let's order!

293
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,948
As I was mustering
the courage to call Zoey</i>

294
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:03,616
<i>and tell her
my true identity...</i>

295
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,201
Zoey...

296
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:07,453
I'm Batman.

297
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:09,372
Hmm. That'd be cool.

298
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:11,007
<i>...the strangest thing
happened.</i>

299
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,214
I need your help.

300
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,215
Just to warn you.

301
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,466
What I'm about

302
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:23,019
to show you is not
a hundred percent legal.

303
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,139
Wasn't expecting bunnies.

304
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,557
I stole them, Ted.

305
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:29,309
My animal rights group
liberated these guys

306
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,926
from an evil cosmetics company.

307
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,262
And I figured,
"Hey, Ted's a vet.

308
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,648
He can check them out
and make sure they're okay."

309
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,818
Absolutely. Just let me run up
and get my bag of vet supplies.

310
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,236
Okay.

311
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:43,122
Why would I say that?

312
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:45,375
Well, I know what I'm getting.

313
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,243
Oh? Oh?
The porterhouse.

314
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:48,578
I've had it here before.

315
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,414
It is like this. It's huge.

316
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,050
Well, spare no expense, buddy.

317
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:55,752
Dinner is on me,
and-and get dessert.

318
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,920
Maybe this molten chocolate
lava cake?

319
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,639
I just want you to be happy.

320
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:01,624
Thanks, man.

321
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,393
Next time, it is on me.
Aw.

322
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,311
- Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right. 
- Totally.

323
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,597
We'll just be here.

324
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:13,019
You're great.

325
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,987
Ah. Thanks, bro.

326
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:17,440
It's, uh.... it's
going on a while.

327
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,941
I know.

328
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:21,027
Thanks.

329
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:22,578
Damn, baby, be cool!

330
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:23,830
You're acting like

331
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,198
he has six months to live.

332
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,582
It's your fault!

333
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,868
You ladies
and your salty sailor talk!

334
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:31,871
Oh, come on! What about you men
and your locker room talk?

335
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,988
Locker room talk.

336
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,540
Do you want to know
what it's like

337
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,675
in a men's locker room?

338
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:37,093
Hey.
Hey.

339
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:39,879
It's just a bunch
of uncomfortable dudes</i>

340
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,598
<i>trying to get out of there
as quickly as possible.</i>

341
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:46,285
<i>And one old guy
just letting it all hang out.</i>

342
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,720
Are you suggesting

343
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:49,472
that guys don't talk about sex?

344
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:52,058
Yes, we do,
but you know what we say?

345
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,476
<i>"I hit that."</i>

346
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:54,777
<i>"I got some."</i>

347
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:55,978
<i>"I tapped it."</i>

348
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:57,613
<i>"I squeezed those."</i>

349
00:12:57,614 --> 00:12:58,865
Discreet and efficient.

350
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:00,400
Not to mention classy.

351
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:01,901
Thank God that I'm not dating.

352
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:04,353
If I thought that Lily talked
in that much detail

353
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,572
about our sex life,
I'd probably kill myself.

354
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:12,412
Oh, no.

355
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:13,863
What did you tell her?

356
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,248
Oh, nothing.

357
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:17,383
We don't talk about you!

358
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,168
Are you sure?

359
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:23,723
Yeah. That argument
has no traction whatsoever.

360
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:27,343
You just broke in
and stole these guys?

361
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:28,895
Aren't you worried
about getting arrested?

362
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,264
Nah. I've been arrested
lots of times.

363
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:44,527
Chinese Democracy.

364
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:45,778
Wow.

365
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,080
You're a little bit crazy.

366
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:50,917
Well, I'm usually crazy
for a good cause.

367
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:53,453
I can't just sit by while
voiceless people or animals,

368
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:55,171
or even buildings
get screwed over.

369
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:57,256
I'm certainly not going
to just sit by

370
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:00,760
while GNB turns The Arcadian
into a soulless metal box.

371
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,178
Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,280
Although I hear there's
a lovely rooftop patio

373
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:06,716
where folks can enjoy a
nice bag lunch, so...

374
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:10,586
Ted, I will find the bastards
at GNB responsible for this,

375
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:12,254
and I promise you,

376
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:15,641
I will take them down.

377
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,611
Cuckoo!

378
00:14:18,612 --> 00:14:20,613
Ted, this woman is an anarchist,

379
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:23,065
a sociopath, a lunatic,

380
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:26,319
and for the love of God, boobs?!

381
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,987
Solid C-cup, perky bounce.

382
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:29,822
Momentary grudging respect.

383
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,876
Zoey does
what she believes is right,

384
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:35,628
and I want to do the same thing.

385
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:38,113
We have to find a new site
for this building.

386
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:39,832
Ted, that is never gonna happen.

387
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,251
Well, I can't tear down
The Arcadian.

388
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:44,337
I'm sorry,
but I'm off the project.

389
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,139
Hey, guys!

390
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,290
I appreciate the great turnout,

391
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,459
but just so we're all
on the same page,

392
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,095
this is not a rally
to legalize marijuana.

393
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:55,264
Oh, bummer!

394
00:14:58,352 --> 00:14:59,769
Hey.

395
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,987
Hey, Ted.

396
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,805
I'm so glad you came.

397
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:04,974
Well, you really got
to me the other night.

398
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:07,610
I want to get involved
with "Save The Arcadian."

399
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:09,946
Great. I'll grab
you a picket sign.

400
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:11,247
Hmm.

401
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:15,418
<i>Do you want "GNB puts the
douche in fiduciary..""</i>

402
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:18,871
...or "It's always 4:20
somewhere"?

403
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:21,591
Dudes, you forgot your signs!

404
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:24,594
As I looked up at that
magnificent old structure,</i>

405
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:27,763
<i>I realized I wasn't letting my
feelings for Zoey mislead me.</i>

406
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:30,216
<i>This building really was
worth saving.</i>

407
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:36,939
Ted, everything okay?

408
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,125
Yea... um... um...

409
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:45,347
You work for GNB?

410
00:15:47,868 --> 00:15:50,152
Dude, why are you dressed
like a wizard?

411
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:52,738
She was really hot, okay?

412
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:03,888
How the hell could you do that?

413
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:05,922
Simple. I rented the chair.

414
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:07,857
The bunny was here already.
That was lucky.

415
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:09,509
I waited
to do the dramatic swivel

416
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,394
until I heard your key
enter the door.

417
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:11,729
The billboard, Barney.

418
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,231
I had to. Now that you have
no shot with the girl,

419
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:15,900
you'll realize you never cared
about the building,

420
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:17,451
and everything can go back
to normal.

421
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:19,403
<i>You're wrong. I do care.</i>

422
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,988
And I'm still quitting.

423
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:22,323
Don't you get it, Ted?

424
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,575
We're tearing down The
Arcadian either way.

425
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:28,245
It's a stupid old piece-of-crap,
run-down, snake-infested dump!

426
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:30,197
Okay, are there
or aren't there snakes?!

427
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,799
Who mentioned snakes?!

428
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,384
And stop shouting!

429
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,720
You're scaring Cottontail.

430
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:36,921
You named the rabbit?

431
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:39,090
You took longer to get here
than I thought,

432
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,257
we bonded, I'm keeping her.

433
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:41,592
The point is,

434
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:43,594
you now have a chance

435
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:45,596
to design your own building.

436
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:46,713
Dude,

437
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,516
you can do
whatever you want with it.

438
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,034
You're right.

439
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:52,953
You're right. I can
design it however I want.

440
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,822
So you're back in?

441
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:57,358
Yeah.

442
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,944
That night, as I
worked on a new design</i>

443
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:02,580
<i>that just might solve
all my problems...</i>

444
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,035
<i>...Marshall was visited
by a disturbing vision.</i>

445
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:10,421
Ugh, he thinks I like this...</i>

446
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,873
But it feels disgusting.

447
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:15,626
<i>Uh, it looks disgusting.</i>

448
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,261
Um...

449
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,380
Uh, is this working for you?

450
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:20,931
"Uh, is this
working for you?"

451
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,183
Oh, of course,

452
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:24,351
because what woman doesn't
like being slobbered on

453
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,604
while some giant paws
at her nether regions

454
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:29,557
<i>like Lenny from
Of Mice and Men?</i>

455
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:31,091
Oh, you're bad.

456
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,276
More Cosmos?

457
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:33,427
Mm.

458
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,779
I can't... I
can't do this!

459
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,647
I can't stop thinking
about you and Robin!

460
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:38,482
Oh, I've had that
a couple times.

461
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:41,368
Just lean into it
and let it fuel things.

462
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,536
Look, no. You know what?

463
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,572
Why don't you just...
Why don't you just

464
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:48,159
call Robin, okay,
and have a good laugh about it?

465
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,245
Whoa!

466
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:54,131
Traction could have
prevented that.

467
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:59,503
Well,

468
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:02,706
hope you don't mind, we made
some changes to the billboard.

469
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,596
Well, that explains
a few voicemails.

470
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:11,599
Listen, Zoey, I think
we can save The Arcadian.

471
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,683
No. Maybe not

472
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,101
in the way you were picturing,

473
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,436
but I stayed up all night

474
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,304
working on a new
concept, all right?

475
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,156
What if my design
could incorporate

476
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:20,441
The Arcadian's facade

477
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,026
into the new GNB headquarters?

478
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:24,829
Kids, it was one
of those moments in life</i>

479
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,413
<i>where everything
comes together...</i>

480
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:32,419
<i>the girl, the building,
everything, until...</i>

481
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,371
Are you married?
Yeah.

482
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:38,375
So you were saying, the facade
will be completely preserved?

483
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:43,097
This isn't about the girl.

484
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,682
It's about the building.

485
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:47,017
Yeah, it was about the girl.</i>

486
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:50,170
Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?

487
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,555
This wouldn't work.

488
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:53,858
Zoey, The Arcadian was
a really great building once,

489
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,009
but it's falling apart,
and it's full of snakes.

490
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,895
Snakes?
I don't recall saying snakes.

491
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:02,316
Then he gets this panicked look
on his face, says,

492
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,618
"I can't do this,"
and storms out.

493
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:05,903
Wow, that is weird.

494
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:08,072
But here's the crazier part.

495
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,957
No. You know what?

496
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,025
Papa don't back down
from a fight.

497
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,829
So why don't you tell Robin...
about this!

498
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:20,000
It was amazing.

499
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:23,003
He was passionate, animalistic,

500
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,972
a complete stud.

501
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,340
Wow.

502
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:29,059
So he's right there
making you say all this, huh?

503
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,313
Yup. "'You're like
a Greek god,'

504
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:34,214
I moaned, as the..."

505
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,882
I can't read that, baby.

506
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,068
"Musky scent of man."

507
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:40,738
"As the musky scent of man

508
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:46,660
"and Marshall's sure-footed
traction intoxicated

509
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:47,894
and overpowered me."

510
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,029
That sounds real.

511
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,031
And as for Zoey, it was funny.

512
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:53,250
<i>I'd lied to her,
then completely let her down.</i>

513
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:54,735
<i>And I barely knew the girl.</i>

514
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,403
<i>But there was something
about her.</i>

515
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,390
<i>I couldn't help but wonder
if I'd ever see her again.</i>

516
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,542
Hey, Mosby!

517
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,494
You're gonna have

518
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:07,097
to come out of your hole at
some point, you son of a bitch!

519
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,349
Yeah!

520
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,717
Legalize it!

521
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:11,352
Dude!

522
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:12,753
Ready.

523
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,054
Aim.

524
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:15,556
Fire!

525
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:17,591
Why, yes.</i>

526
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,527
<i>Yes, I would see her again.</i>

527
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,147
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

528
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:27,182
How's it going with Robin?

529
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:30,536
Uh, I think
I have to break up with her.

530
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:32,621
Really? Why?
You with her?

531
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:35,507
Yeah, well, there's this...

532
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:45,751
kind of weird thing she likes
to do in the bedroom.

533
00:20:45,752 --> 00:20:47,920
Hey, what's not for everyone?

534
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,706
Guys, come on.
What is it?

535
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:53,041
