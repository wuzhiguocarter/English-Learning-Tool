1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:04,670
So, this chick and I are going
at it behind the Central Park Zoo.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,840
The Bonobo chimps
start giving us a standing O,

3
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:11,162
and just when I'm about to give her
the same thing... What up?...

4
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:15,264
I can't.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,720
I can't.
Guys,

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,815
I know you count the minutes until
you can escape from your humdrum lives

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,690
by hearing how awesome mine is,
and I love doing that for you,

8
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:27,247
but I just can't tonight.

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,908
What's wrong?

10
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:30,780
I don't want to talk about it.

11
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:33,581
Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch
last night?

12
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,201
Deadliest Catch ever!

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,702
All right, I'll tell you!

14
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:40,665
My mother is selling the house
I grew up in.

15
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,833
All of my childhood memories gone,

16
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:44,877
- just like that!
- That sucks.

17
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,828
- I've been there, buddy.
- What are you talking about?

18
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:49,757
Your mother still lives
in that house.

19
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,119
With her new hippie husband, Clint.

20
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:55,070
The comfort of home is a little ruined
when someone turns your old room

21
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:57,390
into what I'm pretty sure
is a Tantric sex temple.

22
00:00:57,913 --> 00:01:00,519
With all the bamboo,
pot smoke and '60s music,

23
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,188
it's like my old G. I Joes are frozen
in some weird Vietnam flashback.

24
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:06,116
Anyway,

25
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:08,812
I need you guys to come out
to Staten Island on Saturday

26
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,319
and help box everything up.

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,733
You expect us to spend

28
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:15,741
a whole day packing up
your mom's house?

29
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:18,577
Of course not.
It's a two-day job.

30
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:20,705
- Pass.
- Same.

31
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,345
Unsubscribe.

32
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:26,680
You guys are adorable.

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,172
You seriously believe that I,
can't talk you into this?

34
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:32,383
I got the Queen
to give me a fist bump.

35
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,718
No one believes that.

36
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:36,983
You may be able to talk
the brain surgeons you pick up

37
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:40,266
into doing whatever you want,
but it's not gonna work on us.

38
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,680
How did he do that?

39
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:07,370
<i>So there we were helping Barney
pack up his childhood home.</i>

40
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:10,337
Ted, that thing you're packing
is way too big to fit in that box.

41
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,964
Yes, that's what your mom said.

42
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,424
How dare you!

43
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:15,468
No, she actually said that.

44
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:18,846
Dear, I thought I told you,
that's just not going to fit in there.

45
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,391
Someone order something tall,
dark and awesome?

46
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,652
- My goodness!
- Mama.

47
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:32,276
Look at my two sons.
So big and strong and handsome.

48
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,338
- Mom.
- Stop.

49
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:36,655
And how is
my delicious little grandson?

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,114
- Did he get the clothes I sent him?
- Check it. Huh?

51
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:43,231
How cute is that, right?

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,750
When was the last time you saw
a diaper poking out

53
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,416
of a Dolce and Gabana suit?

54
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,834
Tuesday at work.

55
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,171
Some of the senior partners
are really getting up there.

56
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:54,799
So, Ted, yesterday

57
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,344
at work, I totally talked you up
to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.

58
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,137
Yeah?
What did you say?

59
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,973
You know, how funny you are...

60
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,307
- Guilty.
- Handsome.

61
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,475
Who, me?

62
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,935
Incredible lover.

63
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,186
- Really?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,346
I was all like,

65
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:12,149
"He knows a woman's body
better than she knows her own,

66
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,086
"endless waves
of pleasure just cresting

67
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:17,729
"and breaking for hours and hours...

68
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:21,011
"Orgasms so intense
that you just black out."

69
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,783
All that stuff.

70
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,247
How can I possibly live up
to that review?

71
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,040
You know
what you're doing down there.

72
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:31,126
Teddy Westside can bring it.
We know this.

73
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,752
But that is not the point.
You broke the first rule

74
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:36,882
of setting people up: undersell.

75
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,263
It's like, if someone's never seen
<i>The Karate Kid,</i>

76
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,445
you don't say,
"It's the greatest movie ever."

77
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,980
You say, "it's pretty good"

78
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:45,182
And then they see it,
it blows their freakin' mind.

79
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:48,024
Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like,
"Sweep the leg!"

80
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,562
And Daniel-san's all like...

81
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,587
Maybe I did oversell you a bit.

82
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:05,071
Thank you guys so much
for helping us out with this stuff.

83
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:08,497
It gives us a rare insight
into the makings of Barney Stinson.

84
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,708
Like, look at this.

85
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,592
Who was a cute
little basketball player

86
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:16,505
before he became
the biggest pervert in the world?

87
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:19,289
I loved Pee Wee basketball.

88
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:21,760
Well, until
they kicked me off the team...

89
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:25,055
I was so awesome,
the coach asked me to quit

90
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,558
because it wasn't fair
to the other kids.

91
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:33,856
That sounds plausible.

92
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,530
It's true.

93
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:36,865
Tell him, James.

94
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:39,445
Yeah, he had, like,
a four-foot vertical leap.

95
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,114
He would hit it from the outside,
hit it from the inside...

96
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,157
He sucked.

97
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,452
Coach cut him from the team,
mom fed him that so he'd feel better.

98
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:48,805
Oh, my God!
Look at this.

99
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,703
My letter from
the Postmaster General.

100
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:54,418
I can't believe he took the time
to write this...

101
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,296
"Dear Barney..."

102
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,459
I sincerely apologize about losing
all the invitations

103
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:03,102
you sent out
to your eighth birthday party.

104
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,404
That's why none of your classmates
showed up.

105
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,034
Not because you threw up

106
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,928
when they turned the lights off
at the Planetarium.

107
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,803
No one even noticed that.

108
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:19,122
Janey Masterson's mother is a whore,

109
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,414
and with gin on her breath
at 10:00 in the morning,

110
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,868
she's got some nerve kicking us
out of the carpool.

111
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:29,488
Love, Postmaster General.

112
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:34,343
Thank you.

113
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,936
- Does your mom make that up a lot?
- Constantly.

114
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:42,048
She put more effort
into some lies than others.

115
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:44,385
Mom? Who's my dad?

116
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,656
All the other kids at school know
who their dad is.

117
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,674
Who's mine?

118
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:50,387
I don't know.

119
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:52,811
That guy.

120
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:57,648
Did she tell you that Bob
Barker was your dad, too?

121
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,507
I heard Flip Wilson,

122
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:01,988
Bill Cosby,

123
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,857
James Earl Jones,
Meadowlark Lemon...

124
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,865
The list goes on.

125
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:11,196
I  can't get a straight answer about
who my real dad is and Barney's no help.

126
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:14,562
He still believes every lie
that my mom told us growing up.

127
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,667
Not me.
I caught on early.

128
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,080
Careful!

129
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,378
Michael Jackson sent me
this glove for my tenth...

130
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:22,715
Damn.

131
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:28,530
Loretta really lied a lot
to her kids.

132
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:32,011
She's not alone.
Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper,

133
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:34,642
his mom would suddenly decide
he was "sick"

134
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:37,122
and give him cough medicine
until he passed out.

135
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:39,873
That's what stunted my growth.

136
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:43,061
I hit 6'4" in the fifth grade,
and then I just stopped.

137
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:47,316
And then there's the most popular
parental lie in history.

138
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,657
Santa.

139
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,319
That's a good lie.

140
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,063
Like when we tell Ted he'll meet
the right girl and settle down.

141
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:55,861
- I always find that reassuring.
- You will meet her.

142
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:57,136
You think so?

143
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:02,831
Santa's still a lie,
and I'm not lying to our kids.

144
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,682
Baby, it's Santa.

145
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:07,479
Don't you want our kid
going to sleep on Christmas Eve

146
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,375
with their hearts full of hope,

147
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,930
their heads full of crazy
cough syrup nightmares,

148
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,955
knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle
is stuffing their stockings full of joy

149
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,563
and stuffing his belly full of milk
and lutefisk that they left him?

150
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,983
Milk and lutefisk?
Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?

151
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:26,046
That's what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m.

152
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:29,067
when he's battling a snowstorm
over the Rockies, a sugar crash.

153
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,950
- No. Santa needs protein.
- I'm not lying to our kids.

154
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,615
Valentines.
The second base of third grade.

155
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,375
I always got a Valentine
from every single girl in my class.

156
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,032
Funny how all these girls have
the exact same handwriting

157
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:46,987
as the Postmaster General, Mom,

158
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:51,046
and home run king, Frank Aaron.

159
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,675
Yeah, school girls...

160
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,223
The more they ignore you,
pretend to hate your guts,

161
00:07:56,348 --> 00:08:00,270
lock you in the coatroom over winter
break, the more they secretly like you.

162
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,166
This isn't...

163
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,927
Who's Sam Gibbs?

164
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,443
No idea. Why?

165
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:09,119
Mom addressed this
and never sent it.

166
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:10,488
What's in it?

167
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,918
It's a picture of you and me
when we were little kids.

168
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,878
On the back, Mom wrote...

169
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:24,461
"Your son."

170
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:31,218
Everyone, lunch is ready.

171
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,798
Who wants Sloppy Joes?

172
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,179
Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?

173
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,810
That doesn't sound familiar.
Who wants Sloppy Joes?

174
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,374
There's a picture of me and Barney
 addressed to him.

175
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,231
And you wrote "your son"
on the back.

176
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,650
Oh, no, that...

177
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:47,776
It says "Yourson."

178
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,533
For Yourson, North Dakota.

179
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,780
That's where we took the picture.
Lovely town.

180
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,623
We went kayaking,
and you two rescued the mayor's dog

181
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,607
which had wandered into the rapids.

182
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,495
That mayor, Sam Gibbs,

183
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,377
asked for your picture so the city
could make statues of you both.

184
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,834
I guess I never sent it.
That's embarrassing.

185
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,428
Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?

186
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:11,469
If this picture was taken in Dakota,
why is our swing set in the background?

187
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,869
I don't know!

188
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:16,972
I did my best as a single parent,
and it wasn't always easy,

189
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:20,304
and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw
right on top of the Sloppy Joe,

190
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,477
because it's delicious that way!

191
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:26,734
Can you believe her?

192
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:28,426
I know.

193
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,159
Forgetting to send the photo.

194
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,223
That poor sculptor had
to work from memory.

195
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:36,158
Those statues probably look
nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!

196
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,204
So, Ted?
You were worried

197
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,915
that I oversold you to Liz.
Well, I fixed it.

198
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,042
- How?
- I sent her another email.

199
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:49,374
"Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound
like I was trying to oversell Ted.

200
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:52,750
"The truth is, he is a genuinely
nice, down to earth guy,

201
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,718
and I think you two
would really hit it off."

202
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,679
Thank you. That's perfect.
That totally takes the pressure...

203
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,890
"Is he going to rock
your world in bed? No.

204
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,350
"But he's clean,

205
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:05,020
"open to criticism,
and not into anything too weird.

206
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:06,980
"He's not bad at all.

207
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,448
Not bad at all."

208
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,275
Now you went too far in the...

209
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,111
"I'll be honest. The first few times
aren't gonna be that great.

210
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,398
"He's going to say
"Are you finished?" more times

211
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:17,449
- than a waiter in a busy restaurant."
- Stop!

212
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,661
Listen to me. There is no
Yourson, North Dakota.

213
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,288
And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor.

214
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,290
He might be one of our fathers.

215
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,542
He's not my dad.
My dad's Bob Barker.

216
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,713
You've gotta stop living
in these fairy tales that Mom told us!

217
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,240
Bob Barker is not your father.

218
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,093
Sam Gibbs might be,

219
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,722
but Bob Barker is absolutely,
unequivocally not your father.

220
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,770
I suppose you have a problem
with the Easter Bunny, too.

221
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,895
Not now.

222
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,394
This address isn't too far.

223
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,066
Are you coming with me, or not?

224
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,278
<i>So we're doing this?</i>

225
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,829
We're really going to go disturb
the peaceful Long Island retirement

226
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:01,808
of the former mayor of Yourson,
North Dakota, on a Sunday afternoon?

227
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,715
Real classy, James.
Real classy.

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,476
You're too scared to face the truth.
You're living in a dream world.

229
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,504
Maybe we shouldn't have
brought these Sloppy Joes.

230
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,340
What's done is done.

231
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,762
"Ted Mosby is solid as a rock."

232
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:23,856
"Dependable."

233
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,967
"Rugged."

234
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,230
Why don't I just go to the Chevy
Web Site and copy down adjectives?

235
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,524
I just want to hit that
perfect middle ground.

236
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,330
How about we just go
wildly to both extremes

237
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,883
and just let them balance
each other out?

238
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:40,991
"Ted Mosby is really handsome,
but extremely violent,

239
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,320
"and really rich,
but lacks bladder control."

240
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,373
- Damn.
- What?

241
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,414
That last bump
just made me hit send.

242
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:53,670
Don't worry. I'm sure
that everyone will get it's a joke.

243
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,695
They won't. They're gonna think...

244
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:57,090
Wait. "Everyone"?

245
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,872
"Really rich"?

246
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:07,434
You ready for this?

247
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,602
For what?

248
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,480
I don't know who lives here,
but it's not my dad.

249
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:16,943
Wait. Wait.

250
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:19,176
Please, stop.

251
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:20,906
Just give me a second, okay?

252
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,532
- I thought you said that he...
- Stop. Come on.

253
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:26,341
I know Bob Barker's not really...

254
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,580
you know.
I'm not crazy.

255
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,248
I just...

256
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,667
I needed that.

257
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,261
I know it may sound stupid,
but I didn't always feel so great

258
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:40,592
about myself growing up, and so having
a celebrity dad made me feel special.

259
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:42,670
But you're right, James.

260
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,313
It's time to...

261
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,499
let go of the fantasies.

262
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:49,226
It's time to grow up.

263
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:51,426
Come here.

264
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,454
Can I help you?

265
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,501
- You're Sam Gibbs.
- Yes.

266
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,888
I'm James Stinson,

267
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:19,374
and...

268
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,634
I think you may have known
my mother, Loretta Stinson...

269
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,402
in the '70s.

270
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:30,866
I knew Loretta.

271
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:34,593
My mother meant to send you this.

272
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:46,463
You're my son.

273
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,857
God, this must be
so hard for Barney.

274
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:04,151
Yeah, but you know what?
He took a big step today...

275
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,038
Look at us!

276
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:21,248
It's like three of the same guy.

277
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,954
My God, this explains why
I was always so awesome at basketball.

278
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,292
Guys, I'm black!

279
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,402
Sorry. African-American.

280
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,039
I'm allowed to say either.

281
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,874
I gotta go get my camera!

282
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,557
That is my younger brother, Barney.

283
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,544
He just thought he'd meet
his real dad today.

284
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,632
And he's not taking it so well.

285
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,345
My head's kind of spinning, too.

286
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,810
Loretta and I only saw each other

287
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,188
for a couple of months.

288
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,640
You were two before
I knew you existed,

289
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,116
and at that point,
your mother made it clear,

290
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:55,977
she wanted to raise you alone.

291
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,259
I had to respect her wishes, but

292
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,519
I always wanted to meet you.

293
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,743
Barney and James
are two years apart.

294
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,974
If Sam knew Loretta
for a few months,

295
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:09,034
he couldn't be Barney's father.

296
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,151
He's also...

297
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,084
quite the detective.

298
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,578
Don't worry.


299
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,168
We'll snap Barney
out of this when he gets back.

300
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,705
Or, we could just let him have
this one.

301
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,565
- Are you kidding?
- Barney's losing his childhood home,

302
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,901
he admitted
Bob Barker's not his dad,

303
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:31,763
and then he watched James
meet his real father.

304
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,807
It's a lot to go through.

305
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,392
Can't we let him be black for a day?

306
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:39,965
Ted, Capture the moment!

307
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,580
You'd need Salvador Dali
to capture this,

308
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:45,013
but I'll give it a whirl.

309
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,595
I thought
I was a light-skinned Caucasian,

310
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:53,118
but in truth, I'm a really
light-skinned African-American.

311
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,117
Try to hail a cab in Manhattan.

312
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:58,180
Am I right?

313
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:01,433
No one's stopping for this.

314
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:05,084
They don't understand
what I'm talking.

315
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,774
<i>During that afternoon,
Sam and James began to discover</i>

316
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,334
<i>how much they had in common.</i>

317
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:18,865
You know this.

318
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:42,486
There you go.

319
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:56,350
- Weird day.
- Weird day.

320
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,642
Look at that!

321
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,103
Liz wants to meet you.

322
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:03,736
That's great!

323
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:05,486
I guess.

324
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:09,919
You said Liz was a total ten.

325
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:13,615
Why would she want to meet
the freak show you described?

326
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:17,661
You oversold her!

327
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,913
- Maybe a little.
- You said She was a ten.

328
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,047
I did not specify on what scale.

329
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:25,000
- You said she looked like a movie star.
- She does.

330
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,546
It's Robert De Niro,
but, like, super buff like in Cape Fear.

331
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:31,516
Dad, look how fast I run!

332
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,996
He's a really sweet guy,

333
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,012
and he's great with my son.

334
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,556
I have a grandson?

335
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:42,606
His name's Eli.

336
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,698
He's beautiful.

337
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,234
You're not looking!

338
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:56,493
<i>Eventually, the strangest afternoon
of our lives wound to a close,</i>

339
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,184
<i>we headed back to Staten Island,</i>

340
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,745
<i>where Barney and his mom had
a long overdue heart-to-heart.</i>

341
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,286
- I need to talk to you.
- Me first.

342
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,111
I need to ask you something and,

343
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,131
I want you to be honest with me.

344
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:17,549
Why do white people like Carrot Top?

345
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:24,446
Listen...

346
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:29,296
I always wanted
to be enough for you boys.

347
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:34,112
I think that's why it always hurt
whenever you asked about your dads,

348
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,248
because I was always trying so hard
to be both parents for you.

349
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:40,952
But I was being selfish.

350
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:44,747
You deserve the truth.

351
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:47,272
Here it is.

352
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,902
Sam is not your father.

353
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,174
Are you sure?

354
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,316
He's black, dear.

355
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,913
But if you want, I can tell you
who your father really is.

356
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:06,978
<i>At that moment,</i>

357
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,020
<i>Barney suddenly saw his childhood</i>

358
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,095
<i>more clearly
than he ever had before.</i>

359
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,054
I'm sorry, but your son
can't be on the team.

360
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:17,530
He's terrible.

361
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,619
What'd Coach say, Ma?

362
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,870
He said you're too
good to be on the team.

363
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,155
It's not fair to the other boys.

364
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,457
That's okay.

365
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,085
We can play together
in the backyard.

366
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,752
Why didn't anyone come?

367
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,997
You know what, dear?

368
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,874
Apparently, there was a
mix-up with the mail.

369
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:43,181
I just got this letter from
the Postmaster General.

370
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:47,005
"Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize

371
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,110
"for losing all the invitations

372
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:51,998
you sent out to your
eighth birthday party."

373
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,468
I don't need it.

374
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:12,112
But it's your father.

375
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,546
I already have a father.

376
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:18,072
And his name...

377
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:20,260
is Loretta.

378
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:26,113
<i>Kids, your uncle Barney
grew up without a dad.</i>

379
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,699
<i>And it always made
him feel incomplete.</i>

380
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:30,440
<i>But as he hugged Loretta,</i>

381
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:33,581
<i>so around by the boxes into
his happy childhood,</i>

382
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:38,232
<i>he realized he had
one hell of a mom.</i>

383
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,487
Wait. Dad! James!

384
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,544
Where are you going?
That's the best part.

385
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:06,144
Can we go camping?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
