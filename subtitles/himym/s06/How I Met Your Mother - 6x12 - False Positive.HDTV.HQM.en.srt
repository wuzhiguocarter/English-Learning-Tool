00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:02,944
Narrator: <i>In December of 2010,</i>
<i>my friends and I decided</i>

2
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:05,513
to go see It's a Wonderful Life
<i>on the big screen.</i>

3
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:07,348
<i>It seemed like</i>
<i>something we all needed.</i>

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:09,918
<i>After all, it had been</i>
<i>a crazy couple of days.</i>

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,419
<i>It all started...</i>

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,788
<i>With a pregnancy test.</i>

7
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,090
This is taking forever.
Are you sure you did it right?

8
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:18,726
Is there a wrong way
to pee on a stick?

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:22,563
Hey, can I ask you a question
that's plagued me for years?

10
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,831
Can girls aim?

11
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:25,333
Um, can boys aim?

12
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,669
'Cause it seems to me
like I'm taking a mop

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,170
to that bathroom floor
every two days.

14
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,272
Okay, you're the one who
put the <i>Far Side</i> calendar

15
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:32,573
up over the toilet.

16
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,609
You know I laugh
with my whole body.

17
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,278
(Gasps)
It's been two minutes.

18
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,315
(Both exhale)

19
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:43,618
Both:
One, two, three.

20
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:47,322
It's positive. It's positive?
It's positive?

21
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:48,356
It's positive.
It's positive?

22
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:49,357
It's positive!

23
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:50,558
It's positive!

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,026
Whoa!
(Screaming)

25
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:53,261
Whoa!

26
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,963
I'm pregnant.

27
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,130
What?!

28
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,899
I've never seen that
woman before in my life!

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,301
Sorry. Force of habit.
Congratulations!

30
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,071
To Lily and Marshall.

31
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:04,305
To Lily and Marshall.

32
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:05,406
Well, thank you.

33
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,475
I mean, we've never been happier.
Mm.

34
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:10,111
Can't imagine anything
bringing me down right now.

35
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,279
You're not pregnant.

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,515
Well, that did it.

00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,715
Narrator: <i>Kids, this is the</i>
<i>story of the 36 hours</i>

39
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,917
<i>we all thought</i>
<i>Lily was pregnant,</i>

40
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,586
<i>and how it caused each of us</i>
<i>to reexamine our own lives.</i>

41
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:36,854
<i>Because while</i>
<i>this was happening...</i>

42
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:38,322
Are you sure you did it right?

43
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:39,690
<i>...I was on the phone</i>
<i>with Punchy,</i>

44
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,025
<i>my best friend</i>
<i>from high school,</i>

45
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:43,327
<i>who had recently asked me</i>
<i>to be his best man.</i>

46
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,929
Hey, Punchy, I've given this
some serious thought.

47
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,797
I think I know
how we can crush these

48
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:47,898
floral arrangements.

49
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,001
Ah, here it comes.
Hit me up, Schmos!

50
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:54,305
Peonies, lavender blossoms
with a halo of baby's breath

51
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:56,374
for an ambiance
of springtime rejuvenation.

52
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,109
(High-pitched):
¶ Crushed it! ¶

53
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,777
That's exactly
the accent of whimsy

54
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,579
this celebration of love needs!

55
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,814
It's gonna be a magical day.

56
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:05,950
I know what you're thinking.

57
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,119
I wish I was a dude.

58
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,087
I do wish you were a dude.

59
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,591
Because if I was a dude, I could
have Ted Mosby as my best man.

60
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,092
No, and here's why.

61
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,361
Ted, the best man's job

62
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:20,498
is not to crush
the floral arrangements.

63
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,033
It's to get the groom
down the aisle,

64
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:25,036
because, no matter who
he is, he will freak out.

65
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:27,371
And I just don't think
you have what it takes

66
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:29,340
to get that get that soldier
to pick up his rifle

67
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,541
and charge up the hill.

68
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,610
Uh, are you forgetting
I've done this before?

69
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,944
I was Marshall's best man.

70
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,546
And how did that go again?

71
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:38,649
(Both yelling)

72
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,384
Oh for one.

73
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:42,153
Oh, come on.
That wasn't my fault.

74
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:44,789
And need I remind you,
I gave a beautiful toast.

75
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,890
Ted.

76
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:47,525
(Both yelling)

77
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:50,828
Oh, do you take one
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

78
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,164
Oh, God, I'm freaking out.

79
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,700
Why did I chose Ted
to be my best man?

80
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,501
Uh, yeah. It's hard
to take criticism

81
00:02:57,502 --> 00:02:59,503
from someone who just recorded
seven episodes

82
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,439
of <i>Million Dollar Heads</i>
<i>or Tails.</i>

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,641
Narrator: <i>Kids,</i> 
Million Dollar Heads or Tails

84
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,109
<i>was an extremely popular show</i>

85
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,044
<i>with an extremely</i>
<i>simple premise.</i>

86
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:09,046
All right,
your practice flip came up

87
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,047
tails...

88
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,849
But our Vegas oddsmaker
tells us

89
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,952
that the next toss
is still just 50-50.

90
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,420
And so, Jordan,

91
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,422
for one million dollars...

92
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,059
...Heads... or tails?

93
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,161
(Audience shouting suggestions)

94
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,665
What was the year
of the coin again?

95
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,333
Why this sudden obsession
with <i>Heads or Tails?</i>

96
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,102
Well, it turns out

97
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:34,372
that <i>Heads or Tails</i>
has a job opening.

98
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,339
(Audience shouting suggestions)

99
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,640
Ta... heads.

100
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,176
Marni, flip that coin.

101
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:41,045
Ooh! Damn!

102
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,046
(Audience groaning)

103
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,447
So now, because
of that incident,

104
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:44,915
<i>Heads or Tails</i> is looking

105
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,385
for a new
currency rotation specialist.

106
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:48,886
You mean coin flip bimbo?

107
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,588
They're not bimbos!

108
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:53,557
You auditioned, didn't you?

109
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,430
And you're Canadian?!

110
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,765
Mm.

111
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,400
Robin, aside from that coin,

112
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,969
this is the other thing
that's flipping right now.

113
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,570
What is my lid?

114
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,639
For you.

115
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,474
You're the new coin flip bimbo?

116
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,309
Currency rotation specialist.

117
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,545
Robin, you better check yourself

118
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,747
before you trebek yourself.

119
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:17,948
You're a journalist!

120
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,750
What is the matter with you?

121
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,152
Well, it's a national audience!

122
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:22,753
I get to wear shiny dresses!

123
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:24,021
Robin,

124
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,457
have you forgotten about
your New Year's resolution?

125
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:30,361
I am never drinking again.

126
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:31,662
No, before that.

127
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:36,066
(Slurring): I am gonna finish
this whole bottle tonight.

128
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,468
Before that, too.

129
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:38,836
I moved here

130
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:40,938
to work for a big-time
cable news channel

131
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,239
like World Wide News.

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,641
Mm-hmm.
Well,

133
00:04:43,642 --> 00:04:46,010
by this time next year,
I will be wearing

134
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:48,913
a World Wide News
I.D. badge around my neck.

135
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,915
And to show you
that I'm serious,

136
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,217
this is my first and
only drink of the night.

137
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:55,486
Okay.
Okay?

138
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:59,256
Oh, damn, that's smooth.

139
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,859
I thought you finally got that
interview at World Wide News.

140
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,795
Well, I did, but they only
offered me a boring,

141
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:07,298
low-paid,
off-camera research job.

142
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,600
Which could be a stepping stone
to bigger things in your career.

143
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,269
Well, so could <i>Heads or Tails.</i> 
(Snorts)

144
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,171
The first currency
rotation specialist went on

145
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:17,708
to be a semi-finalist
on <i>The Bachelor,</i> and then,

146
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:20,511
she lost, like, a hundred pounds
on <i>The Biggest Loser,</i>

147
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:22,980
and now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

148
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:26,083
Narrator: <i>It seemed like there was</i>
<i>no changing Robin's mind.</i>

149
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,185
<i>But what we didn't know,</i>
<i>in that moment,</i>

150
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:31,121
<i>was that our world was about</i>
<i>to be turned upside down.</i>

151
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,957
I'm pregnant.

152
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,191
What?!

153
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:35,993
<i>Now, kids, when your friends</i>
<i>have great news,</i>

154
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:38,162
<i>you're happy for them...</i>
<i>For, like, a millisecond.</i>

155
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,498
<i>And then you start thinking</i>
<i>about yourself.</i>

156
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,932
Robin:
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

157
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,301
<i>They're really having a baby.</i>

158
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,103
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

159
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:48,305
<i>Starting Monday,</i>
<i>I'm a currency rotation spe...</i>

160
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,673
<i>Oh, who am I kidding?</i>

161
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:52,076
<i>I'm a coin flip bimbo,</i>
and <i>I'm still single.</i>

162
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:53,744
<i>Okay, let's not go there,</i>
<i>Scherbatsky.</i>

163
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,012
<i>That's a whole other thing.</i>

164
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:57,615
<i>I've got to take</i>
<i>that World Wide News job.</i>

165
00:05:57,616 --> 00:06:00,951
Narrator: And so, the next night, we
had <i>two things to celebrate.</i>

166
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:03,420
Well, you are looking at the new

167
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:06,023
associate researcher
at World Wide News.

168
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:07,992
(Gasps) Oh, my gosh.
That's amazing news.

169
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,660
What changed your mind?

170
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,928
Marshall and Lily.

171
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:12,196
I just realized that

172
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,798
I am about to have a little
niece who looks up to me.

173
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,901
And I don't want to be
sad aunt Robin,

174
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:19,436
the aging coin flip bimbo
who gives her the creeps.

175
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:22,540
I want to be cool aunt Robin,
the respected journalist...

176
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,774
(Quietly):
Who gives her beer.

177
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:26,343
What?
What? Oh.

178
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,014
I have never seen you guys
looking so at peace.

179
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,048
(Both sigh)

180
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:32,049
To Lily and Marshall.

181
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,284
To Lily and Marshall.

182
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,418
Well, thank you.

183
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,520
I mean, we've never
been happier.

184
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,489
Narrator:
<i>So the next day Robin called</i>

185
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,357
Heads or Tails
<i>to respectfully decline.</i>

186
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,027
Hi, Mr. Trebek.
This is Robin Scherbatsky.

187
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,562
Narrator:
<i>But at that moment...</i>

188
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:45,696
You're not pregnant.

189
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,964
(Both gasp)

190
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:49,266
As honored as I am
by the offer, um...

191
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,101
(Phone chirps)

192
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,037
Robin:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

193
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,972
<i>They're not having a baby.</i>

194
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:57,808
<i>What am I getting</i>
<i>all up in</i> my <i>head about?</i>

195
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:59,877
That research job sounds hard.

196
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,478
<i>And I'm pretty.</i>

197
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,716
<i>I'm really, really pretty.</i>

198
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,652
You are looking

199
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:10,654
at the new coin flip bimbo.

200
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:14,992
(Imitates fireworks popping)

201
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:19,689
You took the heads or tails job?
Yeah.

202
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,995
What about World Wide News,
your I.D. badge?

203
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:25,097
You made a New Year's
resolution.

204
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:28,300
Okay, I also said I would never
make out with a garbage man.

205
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:31,036
Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans.

206
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:33,405
What's with
the gingerbread house?

207
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:34,773
We're seeing a Christmas movie.

208
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:37,843
It's a Christmas-themed
movie snack.

209
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:40,245
Let's hope Santa brings you
a girlfriend this year, Teddy.

210
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,880
(Mutters mockingly)

211
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:43,282
Where the hell is Barney?

212
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:44,516
Narrator:
<i>Where was Barney?</i>

213
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:45,918
<i>Let's back up again.</i>

214
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,753
<i>You see,</i>
<i>while this was going on...</i>

215
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:49,221
It's positive.
It's positive?!

216
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:50,389
<i>...This was happening.</i>

217
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,492
And now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

218
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,861
Hey, guys.

219
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,863
A yuletide riddle.

220
00:07:57,864 --> 00:08:02,001
What is my second favorite word
that begins with b-o-n?

221
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:03,102
Bon Jovi?

222
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,470
Yeah.

223
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:07,506
What is my third favorite word
that begins with b-o-n?

224
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:09,174
(Imitates buzzer)
Bonus.

225
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:12,344
As in, my end-of-the-year
bonus check.

226
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:13,646
(Laughing)

227
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:15,214
My God, Barney!

228
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,116
I work for GNB, too.

229
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,885
All I got was $15 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

230
00:08:19,886 --> 00:08:21,153
And you earned it, buddy.

231
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:24,023
Check out what I'm
gonna buy for myself.

232
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:26,725
The dibiase.

233
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,127
See those pinstripes?

234
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:30,062
Diamonds.

235
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:33,399
It is the uppest
a person could ever suit.

236
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,568
Uh, has it ever occurred to you
to give some of this to charity?

237
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:39,471
Charity? You're seriously
talking to me about charity?

238
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:41,106
Dude, I am Mr. Charity.

239
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:45,177
I frequently sleep with sixes,

240
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:48,514
chubsters, over-thirties...

241
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:52,451
I am the bill and Melinda gates
of the sympathy bang.

242
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:54,353
Hey, guys.

243
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:55,621
Hi.
Hey.

244
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:56,622
Big announcement.

245
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:57,790
Let me guess.

246
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,158
You got a huge bonus check, too.

247
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,193
No, just a $30 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

248
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,227
Thirty?!

249
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:04,029
I'm pregnant.
What?!

250
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,699
What?! I've never seen that
woman before in my life!

251
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,367
Sorry, force of habit.

252
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:09,768
Congratulations!

253
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,571
<i>Huh. Marshall and Lily are</i>

254
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:13,972
<i>doing something meaningful.</i>

255
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:16,742
<i>And it's making me</i>
<i>less happy about this bonus.</i>

256
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:18,644
<i>And I'm still single.</i>

257
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,446
<i>At least I got</i>
<i>that going for me.</i>

258
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:23,649
So why do I still feel outside
<i>of awesome looking in?</i>

259
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,752
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

260
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:29,121
We've never been happier.

261
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,390
I can't imagine bringing
me down right now.

262
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,259
Oh, Marshall, you only think
you're happy.

263
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,728
Just wait, because tonight,

264
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,997
(imitating Oprah):
is Barney's Favorite Things!

265
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,700
(All cheering)

266
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:48,974
<i>That was the reaction</i>
<i>Barney expected.</i>

267
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:51,310
<i>This was the one he got.</i>

268
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:53,545
Huh?
I don't know what that is.

269
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:55,681
Barney's Favorite Things!

270
00:09:55,682 --> 00:10:00,185
I'm gonna give you all a bunch
of free stuff... like Oprah.

271
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:01,520
Just get excited, okay?

272
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,589
The next hour got pretty weird.

273
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,892
Velour track suits!

274
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,727
Velour is so comfortable.
They're so soft.

275
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:11,497
Remote control helicopters!

276
00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:13,432
(All cheer)

277
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:15,801
Condoms!

278
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:20,472
And last but not least...

279
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:23,509
There is
a fleet of limos outside

280
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,645
waiting to take us to...

281
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,547
A strip club!

282
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:31,884
(Applause, cheering)

283
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:34,787
You get a lap dance!
You get a lap dance!

284
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:36,655
You're gonna give me
a lap dance!

285
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:40,192
Everybody gets a lap dance!

286
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:43,262
That was amazing!

287
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:45,397
It was like a diamond suit
for my soul.

288
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:47,332
I gotta keep going.
I gotta do more.

289
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,568
No. No! I cannot go back
to that strip club.

290
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:52,171
I seen some things.

291
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:54,039
I'm not going back either.

292
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,243
I'm taking the rest of my bonus
to God's strip club.

293
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:00,012
Narrator:
<i>The next day, he paid a visit</i>

294
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:01,480
<i>to the most</i>
<i>charitable man he knew,</i>

295
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:03,248
<i>his half-brother's father,</i>
<i>Sam Gibbs,</i>

296
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,384
<i>a minister at a church</i>
<i>out on Long Island.</i>

297
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:06,785
Sam.

298
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:07,886
Uh, father.

299
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,688
I-I don't mean father father.

300
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:11,023
Unless...

301
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:12,057
What's up, Barney?

302
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:13,759
I'm thinking about

303
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,627
giving some money to charity.

304
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:18,096
Is that the name of the stripper
you've been e-mailing me about?

305
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:20,199
You got to take me off
that list, Barney.

306
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,202
No, I don't mean that charity.

307
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:24,803
That charity is doing peachy.

308
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:27,606
You'll see pics of the two of
them in next week's e-mail.

309
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:28,941
What up!
Barney,

310
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,742
I'm a minister.

311
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:32,778
Unsubscribe.

312
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,214
I-I recently
started giving,

313
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,882
and it felt surprisingly good.

314
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,383
I want to do more.

315
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:39,551
Well, now you're talking.

316
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,820
We have this program
that helps those in need

317
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,088
get back on their feet.

318
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,757
We give them food,
a place to live,

319
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:47,526
clothes for job interviews.

320
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:51,930
Well, I would love to help
by writing a check

321
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:57,436
for... one, zero, zero, zero...

322
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,403
You're not pregnant.

323
00:11:58,404 --> 00:11:59,404
(Both gasp)

324
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,405
...Zero...

325
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:01,473
(Cell phone chimes)

326
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:04,009
Woops. Hold on a second.

327
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,713
<i>Wait. They're</i>
<i>not doing</i>

328
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,414
<i>something meaningful</i>
<i>with their lives.</i>

329
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:11,583
Well, this changes everything.

330
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:14,586
<i>Oh, no, I've already</i>
<i>written four zeroes.</i>

331
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:15,520
(Gasps)

332
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:18,690
<i>Thank you, decimal point.</i>

333
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:22,294
One hundred dollars.

334
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:25,330
That's great!

335
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:26,865
Thank you, Barney!

336
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:33,605
Diamond suited up.

337
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,141
Hey, Ted, can you
spot me for the movie?

338
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:38,477
I don't like to carry
a lot of cash on me.

339
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,128
What happened
to giving the money away?

340
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,663
Yeah, that was back when
Lily was pregnant.

341
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:47,597
Now she's not.

342
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:50,467
Ergo, a suit is born.
(Chuckles)

343
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,168
Dude, what's up with

344
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:53,903
the gingerbread house?
You look ridiculous!

345
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,972
It's a Christmas-themed
movie snack!

346
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:58,375
Ah, I know that move.

347
00:12:58,376 --> 00:12:59,943
You cut a hole in the floor,

348
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:02,512
she reaches into the
living room, finds the tree...

349
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,814
¶ O holy night. ¶

350
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,082
Nice.

351
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:07,584
Where the hell

352
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,119
are Marshall and Lily?

353
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,954
Narrator:
<i>Let's back up one last time.</i>

354
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:12,222
I'm pregnant.

355
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:13,857
What?!
What?!

356
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,792
I've never seen that
woman before in my life!

357
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:16,893
Sorry, force of habit.

358
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,828
Congratulations!

359
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,163
<i>This is great.</i>

360
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:21,564
<i>I'm happy.</i>

361
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,500
<i>I'm so happy,</i>
<i>my heart's pounding.</i>

362
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,968
<i>And I'm sweating.</i>

363
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,569
<i>And I can't breathe.</i>

364
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,405
<i>This is what happiness</i>
<i>feels like, right?</i>

365
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:29,906
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

366
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:31,875
<i>Lily's having a baby</i>
<i>and I'm having a panic attack.</i>

367
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,977
<i>I hope she can't tell</i>
<i>what I'm thinking right now.</i>

368
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,311
<i>I can.</i>

369
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:36,679
<i>And I'm freaking out, too!</i>

370
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,314
<i>There's an alien</i>
<i>growing in my stomach</i>

371
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:40,383
<i>that's gonna explode</i>
<i>out of my vagina!</i>

372
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,252
<i>Do you think the others</i>
<i>can tell we're freaking out?</i>

373
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,087
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

374
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,688
<i>What am I doing</i>
<i>with my life?</i>

375
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:48,992
I should get a Christmas-themed
<i>movie snack for tomorrow night.</i>

376
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,126
<i>They're totally onto us.</i>

377
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,261
<i>What do we do?</i>

378
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:52,862
Just keep smiling, maybe wave.

379
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:53,963
<i>No, don't wave!</i>

380
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:54,964
<i>That makes no sense!</i>

381
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:56,166
<i>I'm committed.</i>

382
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,567
<i>I'm riding this wave</i>
<i>straight to hell.</i>

383
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,502
<i>Let's leave, then the waving</i>
<i>will make sense.</i>

384
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:02,439
Narrator: <i>So Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>headed home.</i>

385
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,441
Marshall:
<i>Lily, we have to relax.</i>

386
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:05,975
There's no need to panic.

387
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,077
True, there's a lot to do,

388
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,378
but we've got nine months
to prepare.

389
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,780
So I say that we just
make a list of everything

390
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:12,715
that needs to get done
before the baby arrives

391
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:14,284
and do everything
on that list tonight!

392
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:16,319
Let's do it!
(Yelling)

393
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,620
Uh-huh, got it.

394
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,022
Okay, that seems easy.

395
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,890
Nursery's painted!

396
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,525
Blue? What if it's a girl?

397
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:23,493
Damn it!

398
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,028
¶ ¶

399
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:38,341
Oh, God, it's 8:00!

400
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,243
We're supposed to meet the
gang at the bar to celebrate.

401
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:41,411
Oh, God. Okay, listen.

402
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:43,446
When we meet them,
we have to keep it together.

403
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,447
Can you keep it together?!

404
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,049
No, I can't keep it together!

405
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,319
Robin: I have never seen you
guys looking so at peace.

406
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,386
(Both sigh)

407
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:51,454
To Lily and Marshall.

408
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,856
Lily and Marshall.

409
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:53,857
Well, thank you.

410
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,726
I mean,
we've never been happier.

411
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,328
(Rock music playing)
This is a nightmare!

412
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,029
We've done everything wrong!

413
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,498
(Screams)

414
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,733
The iPod was on shuffle!

415
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:04,801
(Rock music stops)

416
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:05,835
The Jerky Boys!

417
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,004
Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!

418
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,506
You know what,
the Jerky Boys are funny.

419
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,075
The Jerky Boys aren't funny,
they are awful.

420
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,443
You know what, fine,
if you don't think

421
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:15,044
the Jerky Boys are funny,
then I'm not sure

422
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,813
that I can raise a child
with you, liver lips.

423
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:18,681
(Gasps)

424
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:20,250
Marshall, I don't like this.

425
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,384
I know. Okay?

426
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:23,119
I don't like it either.

427
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,989
It's like I have a hot, burning

428
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,725
ball of stress in my chest,

429
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:30,560
and nothing
will make it go away!

430
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:31,728
You're not pregnant.

431
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,563
Well, that did it.

432
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:36,766
I know this probably comes
as quite a disappointment.

433
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:39,802
Yeah.

434
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:41,371
Huge bummer.

435
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,306
So disappointing.

436
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,142
Hey.

437
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:47,110
Hey.

438
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,044
Are you guys okay?

439
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:49,245
Huh?
Yeah.

440
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:51,781
Why wouldn't we be?
Oh, the baby thing.

441
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:53,249
Oh, yeah, whatever.

442
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,018
Oh, Christmas-themed
movie snack. Nice.

443
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,620
(Chuckles) Don't reach
into the living room!

444
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,390
(Both laugh)

445
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:02,592
Wow, I-I thought you guys
would be devastated.

446
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:03,960
Oh.

447
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:06,362
You know, we're actually
kind of relieved.

448
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,631
We were freaking out for about
a day and a half there.

449
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:10,900
Yeah, this whole thing
got us thinking.

450
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:12,902
Maybe we're not ready
for kids yet after all.

451
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,038
Yeah, we were thinking
maybe we would just get a dog.

452
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,105
Get a puppy!

453
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:17,307
Can you imagine...

454
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,409
That would be the cutest thing!

455
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,144
(Yelling)
No!

456
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:23,179
Oh. Our movie snack.

457
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,114
Are you kidding me?!

458
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,383
All you ever talk about
is having kids!

459
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,018
And now you have
one little freak-out

460
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,820
and you want to get
a dog instead?!

461
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:32,355
No. Unacceptable!

462
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,489
You're gonna turn around,

463
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,491
you're gonna go home, get naked,

464
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:38,294
lie together as man and wife
until Lily is great with child.

465
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,495
Right now!

466
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,764
I'm serious! Go, go, go!

467
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,469
(Singsongy): Marshall and
Lily got in trouble.

468
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,204
And you!
Ooh.

469
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,373
Barney, you look real stupid
in that suit.

470
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,909
You're gonna go get your money
back and give it to charity.

471
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,211
And I don't mean that stripper
you keep e-mailing us about,

472
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,547
even though we beg you
to take us off that list.

473
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:00,083
I can't give this suit back.

474
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:01,584
Ted, I glow in the dark.

475
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,553
I finally glow in the dark!

476
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:06,489
Criminals of New York! Attention!

477
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,225
This man is wearing a
diamond-covered suit!

478
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,226
You could retire

479
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,394
on the pants alone!

480
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:13,396
Merry Christmas!

481
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:15,898
(Stuttering)

482
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:20,203
So, if I get a large popcorn,
you want to go split-skees or...

483
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,537
And you...

484
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,439
You did not move

485
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,442
to the greatest city on earth
to become a coin-flipping bimbo.

486
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:28,411
So here's how it's gonna work:

487
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:30,613
Heads, you take the job
at World Wide News;

488
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,682
Tails, you take
the job at World Wide News.

489
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,250
Ow!
(Coin clinks)

490
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,419
Hey, looks like
somebody got a new gig!

491
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,088
Fine, I'll call them tomorrow.

492
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,224
I'll call them right now.
(Annoyed muttering)

493
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:43,559
(Cell phone ringing)

494
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Hello.

495
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:45,728
Ted, I can't get married!

496
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:46,829
Yes, you can! You love her!

497
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,431
You're right, I do! Thanks, Ted!

498
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:59,242
One for <i>It's a Wonderful Life,</i>
please.

499
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,179
Thank you.

500
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,850
Hi.

501
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:16,459
We're idiots.

502
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,328
This kid doesn't stand a chance.

503
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:23,499
We're ready for this.
We're ready for this.

504
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:27,937
Wow.

505
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:30,039
That's a lot of zeroes.

506
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,108
Y-you sure you're not
missing a decimal point?

507
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:33,376
Nope.

508
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,144
And that's the tour.

509
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,847
Uh, staff meeting's at noon,
you'll meet everyone there,

510
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,282
but first you need
to head down to security.

511
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:41,217
You need to get
your picture taken.

512
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,785
For your I.D. badge.

513
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:45,688
Oh.

514
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,325
You sure?

515
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,494
Positive.

516
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:55,865
And there's more.

517
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,433
Do you still do that thing
where you give

518
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:58,801
people in need
clothes for job interviews?

519
00:18:58,802 --> 00:18:59,702
Yeah. Why?

520
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,638
Bring 'em in, boys!

521
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:10,747
(Chuckles)

522
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:12,949
Merry Christmas.

523
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,251
Thank you, son.
Son?!

524
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,353
It's just an expression.
I'm still not your dad.

525
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,264
Congratulations.

526
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,666
You know, that was
really cool what you did.

527
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:32,201
When we all needed it,

528
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,603
you got us back
on the right path.

529
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:36,506
It's what I do.

530
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:38,975
Hey, Ted, if I, um,
if I ever get married

531
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:40,710
and you're not
the guy I'm marrying...

532
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,111
Big mistake, but go on.

533
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:44,380
...I could really use
someone like you.

534
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,015
You know, in case I freak out.

535
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:47,750
<i>When</i> I freak out.

536
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:48,985
You interested?

537
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:52,255
Are you asking what I
think you're asking?

538
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:55,425
Ted, will you be my best man?

539
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,960
Scherbatsky...

540
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,695
I'm gonna crush it.

541
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:10,470
Hi, there.

542
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:11,771
We've had a lot of fun tonight,

543
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:14,140
but on a more serious note,
this is the time of year

544
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:16,309
when we remember
the importance of giving.

545
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,546
And there's no greater gift
than the gift of booty.

546
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:25,285
So, this holiday season,
why not bang someone in need?

547
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:27,987
I'm Barney Stinson,
and that's...

548
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:29,789
One to grow on.

549
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,957
Um, no.

550
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,494
Hi, there. You know, we've
had a lot of fun tonight...
