1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,334
<i>Kids, in my early days
of being a professor,</i>

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:04,689
<i>I had one simple goal:</i>

3
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:06,714
<i>give a lecture
that changes someone's life.</i>

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,317
<i>Then one afternoon in 2010,
I achieved that goal.</i>

5
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:11,927
Unfinished.

6
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:15,254
Of all the words you could use
to describe <i>La Sagrada Familia</i>...

7
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:18,314
Brown, pointy, weird...

8
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,284
the one that really seems to stick
is "unfinished."

9
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,241
Why?

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,967
Because on June 7, 1926,

11
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,401
the architect Antoni Gaudi...

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:31,322
Whose beard was also brown,
pointy, weird and unfinished...

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,324
... was run over by a bus.

14
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,094
And so,

15
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:39,580
his greatest masterpiece
would remain forever...

16
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,460
<i>But first, let's back up a few days.</i>

17
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:47,319
Ted, look across the bar.

18
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,787
Three chicks:
one hot, one kind of hot

19
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:51,874
and one who I'm assuming
is really funny.

20
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:53,361
We ride!

21
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:56,764
What?

22
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:57,905
I don't know.

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,225
Got a burger coming.

24
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:01,271
Bro, I told you,

25
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,771
if you ever need a wingman,
I'm your guy.

26
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,315
Yeah, I'm not going to go
through that again.

27
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:08,185
Hi.

28
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,708
Barney Stinson.

29
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,133
And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.

30
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:17,785
Thank you.

31
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,808
Fine. I'll have a threeway
with hot and kind of hot

32
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,161
while Giggles films.

33
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:24,136
I ride!

34
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:26,639
So, get this:

35
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:30,312
Last night, I was watching TV,
and some random satellite channel

36
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:32,842
picks up
a certain local Chicago newscast.

37
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:36,129
<i>And now, the 11:00 News
with Don Frank.</i>

38
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:40,913
It's bad enough
to go through a horrible breakup,

39
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,008
but then have that person
pop up on your TV?

40
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:44,107
Are you okay?

41
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,313
I'll admit, at first,
I felt a little weird.

42
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,301
<i>But after the initial shock,
I realized something:</i>

43
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:50,752
<i>I've moved on.</i>

44
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:54,943
Finished with that.

45
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,125
It was a peaceful moment of closure.

46
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:01,120
Good.

47
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:04,500
Where's the poop?

48
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:05,750
Excuse me?

49
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:08,474
When I was a kid,
I had a dog named Bean.

50
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,163
Whenever he made the face
that you're making right now,

51
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:14,508
you just knew he pooped
somewhere in the house.

52
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:17,309
Where's the poop, Robin?

53
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,430
I don't know
what you're talking about.

54
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,015
Where's the poop?

55
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,685
It wasn't entirely
a peaceful moment of closure.

56
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:27,627
Don, here's some breaking news:

57
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,983
there's a zit breaking out
on your forehead.

58
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:35,508
Finished with that.

59
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,966
I'm not proud,
but Don left so quickly

60
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,855
that I never got the chance
to have that final showdown.

61
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,576
Yelling at him, even on TV,
felt kind of good.

62
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,139
And you know what?

63
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,505
Now I truly am over him.

64
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:54,673
- That's great.
- Thanks.

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,009
Where's the poop?

66
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,057
Damn it!

67
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:01,620
In the process
of truly getting over him,

68
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,745
I may have called him

69
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,269
and left an...
indelicate voice mail.

70
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:09,138
I am gonna kill you.

71
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,917
I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you,

72
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:17,516
put your stupid face
on a deep dish pizza and eat it.

73
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,197
And then maybe catch a Bears game.

74
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:23,669
But mostly the killing
and eating your face thing.

75
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:27,289
Give me your phone.
We're deleting Don's number.

76
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,647
Don't worry.

77
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:31,418
I am never doing that again.
It was a one-time thing.

78
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,420
Prove it.
Delete contact.

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,008
There.
Deleted.

80
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,804
Back already.

81
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,946
How was flying solo?

82
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:48,498
And by "solo," I mean
so low that you got shot down.

83
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,194
Look, I didn't get shot down.
Trust me, I'll get the yes.

84
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:57,638
Barney Stinson always gets the yes.

85
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:59,890
This is all part of the plan.

86
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:03,173
After initial contact,
I'm now in the ignoring phase.

87
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,698
Why can't you just
take a girl out to dinner

88
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:07,121
like a normal person?

89
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:11,568
Golden rule: I do not buy dinner
to get the yes.

90
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:14,461
Dinner's a very intimate activity.

91
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:15,629
It requires

92
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,229
a level of connection

93
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:19,466
and eye contact
that sex just doesn't.

94
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,958
Call me old-fashioned, but I need
to have sex at least three times

95
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,427
before I'll even consider
having dinner with her.

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,991
<i>The next day,</i>

97
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,598
<i>I had a surprise visitor.</i>

98
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:31,729
Why are you here?

99
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:36,298
You're dating one of my students.
It's Rachel, isn't it?

100
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:39,194
She wears provocative sweaters,
but she's 19!

101
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,517
I'm gonna have
to hear all about it, right?

102
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:44,575
Go on, tell me every detail.

103
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,493
No, you pent-up old perv.

104
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,953
I brought you a present.

105
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,211
Recognize this?

106
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,765
It's my building.

107
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,462
<i>Kids, you may remember that,
a few years earlier,</i>

108
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,007
<i>I was chosen to design
the new Manhattan headquarters</i>

109
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,425
<i>for Goliath National Bank.</i>

110
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,178
<i>It was the opportunity
every architect dreams about.</i>

111
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:07,162
<i>And when the project
was ultimately scrapped...</i>

112
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,682
<i>it broke my heart.</i>

113
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:12,584
Do you remember how awesome
it was to be co-workers...

114
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,439
nay, bro-workers?

115
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,274
Wait, you don't mean...

116
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,292
It's back on.

117
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,406
We're gonna build your building.

118
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,432

.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

123
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:40,411
This is awesome.
You're designing our new headquarters.

124
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,389
There will be voices that tell you

125
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:44,680
a hockey rink on the roof
is unfeasible.

126
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,179
You've got to shut those voices out.

127
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:50,057
Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.

128
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,433
Are you kidding me?

129
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,937
But designing a building
in New York City is your lifelong dream.

130
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,458
I do not want to work for GNB again.

131
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,858
Those guys are evil.
No offense, Marshall.

132
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:01,746
Dude, none taken.

133
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:06,281
GNB is the Empire from Star Wars.

134
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:09,211
But the Death Star's gonna
get built either way.

135
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,509
Don't you think
the architect of the Death Star

136
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:13,998
is psyched to have
that thing on his space resume?

137
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,641
I mean, yes, his design was flawed
in the sense that a single bullet

138
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:20,389
fired into a particular vent
would explode the whole thing.

139
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,464
That was the contractor's fault.

140
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,686
But that won't happen on your watch.
Because you're Ted Mosby!

141
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:28,250
And you are gonna design
the most beautiful,

142
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,698
ventless, Rebel-proof building
in Manhattan,

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,194
with clearly marked emergency stops

144
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,436
for every trash compactor
on the detention level.

145
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,851
Look, I know this is
hard to understand,

146
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:41,719
but right now, I have a quiet,
simple, happy little life.

147
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:43,277
And I like it that way.

148
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,607
I know what my answer has to be.

149
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,448
I can't take the job.

150
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:50,241
I'm done with that life.
No hard feelings?

151
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,119
Of course not.

152
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,660
All right.

153
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,441
<i>And I thought that was the end
of the story. But then that night...</i>

154
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:06,414
I'm telling you,
no architect would ever design

155
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,053
a giant exposed vent right over
a Death Star's core reactor.

156
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:10,825
That's Space Architecture 101.

157
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,348
It had to be the contractor.
Barney, back me up.

158
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,812
Dude, this is important.

159
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,315
I need another drink.
Marshall, you want anything?

160
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:23,776
No, I'm fine.

161
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:29,557
He's mad at me for turning down the job,
but acting like I'm not even here?

162
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,783
Wait, you turned down the job?
When?

163
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,103
This morning.

164
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,729
That's so weird.

165
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,498
Just an hour ago,
when we were leaving work...

166
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,334
So, you still think
Ted's gonna take the job?

167
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,312
Please.

168
00:07:41,437 --> 00:07:42,606
I'll get the yes.

169
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:46,839
Barney Stinson always gets the yes.

170
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,356
Am I wrong or is that exactly

171
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,722
what Barney says when he's putting
the moves on a girl?

172
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,183
Exactly. It's like
he's putting the moves on you.

173
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:59,395
Yeah, more like the opposite.
He's been ignoring me all night.

174
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,318
Barney wants me to take the job so bad
he's putting the moves on me?

175
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,051
I hope that's his end game.

176
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:11,175
Actually, I don't.
I like you two together.

177
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,201
I don't buy it.
That's crazy, even for Barney.

178
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:17,272
Well, think about it.
We've seen his moves countless times.

179
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,414
What does he do after
he's done ignoring a girl?

180
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,519
Chrissy, I love your glasses.

181
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,668
Really?

182
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,712
They pull focus up from that whole
chin situation you got going on.

183
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,881
To Chrissy.

184
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,969
The backhanded compliment to lower
her self-esteem, a proven winner.

185
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,554
But Barney hasn't done...

186
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,597
I admire your loyalty.

187
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,432
You've had that hairstyle forever.

188
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,659
You don't care that it's out of fashion
or co-opted by the lesbian community.

189
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:42,855
You stick with it.

190
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:44,606
To Ted.

191
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:47,568
Hey, Lily!

192
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,571
Don't "Hey, Lily" me.

193
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,876
I smelled poop all the way
from the hallway.

194
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,244
- No, not this again.
- Where's the poop, Robin?

195
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,954
I left Don another message.

196
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,207
"This just in"

197
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,109
is what I'm gonna say
when I'm stabbing you.

198
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,379
But that's impossible.

199
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,506
- You deleted his number.
- I tried to.

200
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,091
But this thing popped up
that said, "Are you sure?"

201
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:15,113
And I wasn't sure.
I can't lie to my phone.

202
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,426
Oh, sweetie, I totally understand.

203
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:19,433
Delete it!

204
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:20,928
It's not that easy.

205
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,448
You're not just deleting a number,
you're deleting a part of your life.

206
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,076
All those memories,
all those experiences.

207
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,943
It's like you're admitting
they're gone forever.

208
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,839
I know, sweetie.

209
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,007
I know.

210
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:34,258
Delete it!

211
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,949
Okay, if it's that easy,

212
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,869
I'm gonna delete one of your numbers,
see how you like it.

213
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:39,870
My "plezh."

214
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,661
If you can find a number in there
that I don't call regularly,

215
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:44,082
I'll gladly delete it.

216
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,667
Super Kicks Karate.

217
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,272
No, not that one.
That's my dojo.

218
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:49,922
You have a dojo?

219
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,673
I took an introductory karate class.

220
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,946
Wrong room.

221
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,097
Where do the grown-ups go
for the real karate class?

222
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,869
What's the matter, lady?

223
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,099
You scared?

224
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,135
Of you? Please.

225
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,854
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

226
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,842
I hated kindergarten.

227
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,701
All three times.

228
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,863
But I'm totally gonna
sign up for more lessons.

229
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:17,366
How long ago
did you take that class?

230
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:21,178
I don't know. It was around the time
when everyone was going...

231
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,874
How do you even remember that?

232
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:31,880
Lily, this is a number
that you will never dial again.

233
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,934
- I might.
- No, but you keep it in your phone

234
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:36,721
'cause it reminds you of a version
of yourself that you could be,

235
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,658
even if it's a version of yourself
that you'll never become.

236
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:40,806
And that's okay.

237
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,157
No, it's not.

238
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,671
You know what?
There, gone.

239
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:46,477
Your move, Scherbatsky.

240
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,815
I finally know
what your kind goes through.

241
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:52,359
- I get it now.
- For the last time,

242
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,445
I don't care how big it was,
it is not the same as giving birth.

243
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:00,385
Barney's been
"putting the moves" on Ted.

244
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,086
That sucks.
Although I like you two together.

245
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:09,209
He's been doing it to try to get Ted
to design the new GNB Tower.

246
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,544
Which moves?

247
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,755
Did he do the thing where he brags
on himself in the form of a complaint?

248
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:17,027
Man, every time I take out
my business card

249
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:20,264
and women see the GNB logo,
they throw themselves at me.

250
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,629
I miss the chase.

251
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,077
It sucks!

252
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,609
Man, the courtside Knicks seats
that are available

253
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,741
to all upper level GNB employees
are too close to the action.

254
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,625
I keep getting sweat on my suit.

255
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,910
It sucks!

256
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:36,933
Man, GNB's benefits package
is so comprehensive

257
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:39,522
it gives me the freedom to see
any doctor I want.

258
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,158
It sucks!

259
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,952
- He did.
- And the intense eye contact thing?

260
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,620
So, Ted,

261
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:48,989
would you like to split
some jalapeño poppers?

262
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:00,218
And the thing where he establishs
intimacy through physical contact?

263
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:03,930
You know why jalapeño poppers
are so good? It's the cream cheese.

264
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:06,892
That is so true.

265
00:12:09,787 --> 00:12:12,359
Cream cheese
has a mild flavor so it...

266
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,918
it balances out
the spiciness of the jal...

267
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:17,744
the spiciness of the...

268
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,321
Dude!

269
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:23,413
So at any point in this did you say,
"Barney, I know what you're doing,

270
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:26,293
"and it's not going to work.
I am not taking that job"?

271
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:29,623
Well, I mean,
not exactly in those...

272
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,083
You're loving this.

273
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,210
You are.

274
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,587
You're loving the attention.

275
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,359
It's nice to be wanted, okay?

276
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:41,843
And, yes, this is a new vest.
Thank you all for noticing.

277
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,179
That's right, you didn't.
Barney did!

278
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,329
You are so going to spread your legs
and design that building.

279
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,645
I am not that kind of architect.

280
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,567
So get this...
Robin never deleted Don's number.

281
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,477
Everyone thinks it's so easy.

282
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:03,490
Give me your phone.
Let's delete one of yours.

283
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,668
Okay.

284
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,149
No problem.

285
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:09,110
If you can find a number that
I don't need or shouldn't have in here,

286
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,135
be my guest, but good luck.

287
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,959
I keep my phone tight.

288
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,504
Not that one. That's the booker
for the club that my band plays at.

289
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,277
My all-lawyer funk band...
You remember...

290
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:22,801
The Funk, the Whole Funk
and Nothing but the Funk.

291
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,011
<i>Your witness lied</i>

292
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,265
<i>So your case is sunk</i>

293
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,735
<i>I sentence you to a life of funk</i>

294
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,687
<i>Counselors, how do you plead?</i>

295
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,271
<i>Funky.</i>

296
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Kick it.

297
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:44,288
You guys played one gig
four years ago.

298
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:45,449
I'm deleting it.

299
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,618
We're gonna play another gig again.
Probably really soon.

300
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:50,884
It's just we all got
super busy, and...

301
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,250
We're not gonna play
another gig again, are we?

302
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,868
Probably not, baby.

303
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,296
It's hard to hit
that delete button, isn't it?

304
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,094
Well, it's just that without
that number in my phone,

305
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:06,002
I'm just a corporate lawyer
working 60 very un-funky hours a week.

306
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:08,182
Sorry, Marshall.

307
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,432
But if I have to, you have to.

308
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:18,732
Your turn.

309
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:33,665
I gotta tell you something.

310
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,138
That reminds me.
I got you...

311
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:37,918
a little airplane.

312
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,754
It represents the spirit
of adventure.

313
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:42,422
Do you like it?

314
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,549
Do you?

315
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,276
Stop it. Stop looking at me

316
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,763
like I'm the only person
in the world who matters.

317
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,122
I'm not designing the GNB Tower.

318
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:56,061
I known you turned it down.
We hired someone else.

319
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,720
Can you believe it? He's resorting
to the oldest move in the book.

320
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:06,256
The classic, "pretend to take the offer
off the table so I'll want it more."

321
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:09,326
It's so obvious, right?
As if that's gonna make me be like,

322
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,785
"God, I never should have said no."

323
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:13,328
It's not a move, dude.

324
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,218
I executed the paperwork for
the new architect this morning.

325
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:18,792
Barney wasn't lying.

326
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,415
God, I never should have said no!

327
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:28,475
Come on, GNB didn't really
hire a new architect.

328
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,345
This is just one of Barney's moves.

329
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,345
This is just one of Barney's moves.

330
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:35,572
It's not a move, dude. The senior
partners were getting impatient.

331
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:37,392
I thought
you didn't even want the job.

332
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
I didn't!

333
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,234
I don't!

334
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:41,699
I don't.

335
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:42,855
I don't!

336
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:45,066
- Okay, I'll do it!
- What?

337
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,901
It's too late.

338
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,752
I'll design it for half of what
you're paying the other architect.

339
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:52,522
And you know I will do stuff
they would never do.

340
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,747
Lobby stuff.

341
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:56,361
Half?

342
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:00,957
- On behalf of Goliath National Bank...
- Okay, it's a move.

343
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,500
- What?
- Dude!

344
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:05,549
There is no other architect.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied.

345
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,506
I was being Barney's wingman,
and I never get to be the wingman.

346
00:16:08,674 --> 00:16:10,091
You guys lied to me?

347
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,206
You're the world's worst wingman.
You know what? I'm out of here.

348
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:15,995
I can do better.
Take me back.

349
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,599
You son of a bitch!

350
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:20,101
Look, I can't do business
with people who lie to me.

351
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,104
We only lied to you to make you
realize that you want this job.

352
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:26,003
I don't.
I mean, I know I said I did,

353
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:28,309
but that's only
because I fell for the same

354
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,112
creepy, pickup artist voodoo
of yours that countless women...

355
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,396
- 236.
- ... before me fell for.

356
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:35,213
Respect.

357
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:39,383
You want to do this, okay?

358
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,539
You're just scared
of getting hurt again but,

359
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:43,942
you can't let fear steal your funk.

360
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:46,836
That is good. There is
a song in there. Excuse me.

361
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,031
Come on, Ted!

362
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:53,843
- This is your dream.
- No, it's not. Not anymore.

363
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,222
And you know what? Letting go of that
dream was the best decision I ever made.

364
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,476
You guys actually think I have
some lingering itch to be an architect?

365
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,353
Work 20 hours a day and weekends?

366
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:06,856
To get ulcers and pull my hair
out and worry and doubt myself

367
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:09,894
and then at the end of it all,
have the rug pulled out from under me?

368
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,810
I love being a professor, okay?

369
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,956
All that stupid crap they tell you
about how fulfilling teaching is?

370
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,116
It's all true.

371
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,733
I'm happy,
and I'm not letting go of that.

372
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,108
My answer's no.

373
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:26,835
Hey, guys.

374
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,295
Where's the poop, Robin?

375
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:30,581
How do you do that?

376
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:33,005
You are like a bomb-sniffing dog,
except with poop.

377
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,592
You are a poop-sniffing dog.

378
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,511
I think that's just called a dog.

379
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:38,346
Where's the poop, Robin?

380
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,099
Fine. I called Don again.

381
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:45,103
Hey, Don!
It's Robin again.

382
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:49,678
Look, I am sorry for all the calls.
It's just, I saw you on the news,

383
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,326
and it made me a little crazy
for a minute.

384
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,501
I guess I wasn't as
over our breakup as I thought.

385
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,858
But I want to say,
from the bottom of my heart,

386
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:00,842
I am gonna kill you.

387
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,912
No... No, I'm not.

388
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:04,875
I am happy for you.

389
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:08,935
And that Asian slut on
your Facebook page. She's dead, too.

390
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:11,828
I thought you deleted his number.

391
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,986
I did,
but it turns out, I memorized it.

392
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,217
You can't delete contacts
from your brain, Lily.

393
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:18,881
Well, you have to try.
If you ever want to have closure...

394
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:21,156
I am never going to have closure.

395
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:22,890
Okay? Closure doesn't exist.

396
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,359
One day, Don and I
are moving in together,

397
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,154
and the next thing I know,
he's on a plane to Chicago.

398
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,081
It just... ended.

399
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:34,369
And no matter how much I try
to forget that it happened,

400
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:36,594
it will have never not happened.

401
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,396
Don and I will always
be a loose end.

402
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,616
We'll always be...

403
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,002
Unfinished.

404
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,582
Gaudi, to his credit,
never gave up on his dream,

405
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:49,584
but that's not usually how it goes.

406
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:52,175
I mean, usually,
it isn't a speeding bus

407
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,506
that keeps the brown, pointy,
weird church from getting built.

408
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,259
<i>Most of the time,
it's just too difficult</i>

409
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:00,552
<i>or too expensive, or too scary.</i>

410
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,940
<i>It's only once you've stopped</i>

411
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,769
<i>that you realize
how hard it is to start again.</i>

412
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:10,826
<i>So you force yourself
not to want it.</i>

413
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:13,332
But it's always there.

414
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:16,508
And until you finish it,
it will always be...

415
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,258
- Why aren't you in class?
- Why aren't you in class?

416
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,969
Why aren't you in class?

417
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,559
You son of a bitch.

418
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,855
I'll call Marshall.
We'll draw up the contract.

419
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,148
Not so fast.

420
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:56,041
I'm not that easy.

421
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:58,720
<i>And so I made Barney
break his golden rule.</i>

422
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:01,823
<i>I made him take me out to dinner
before I finally gave him the thing</i>

423
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,488
<i>he always got.</i>

424
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:06,118
Yes.

425
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:10,677
<i>And even though
it didn't happen right away...</i>

426
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:13,674
<i>And now, the 11:00
News with Don Frank.</i>

427
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:18,879
<i>Bueno?</i>

428
00:20:20,295 --> 00:20:21,306
Who is this?

429
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,281
<i>No hablo ingles.
Quien es?</i>

430
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:26,694
I'm sorry. Is this 917-456...

431
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:28,685
I'm sorry, 465...

432
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,810
No, wait.

433
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:34,622
<i>Robin finally got some closure, too.</i>

434
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:37,655
Sorry. Wrong number.

435
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:43,322
Finished with that.

436
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:57,044
Hey, punk!
Bit of advice.

437
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:00,850
Next time you step on a
kindergarten teacher's neck,

438
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:03,134
you better finish the job.

439
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:05,152
I knew this day would come.
