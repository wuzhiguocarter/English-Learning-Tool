1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,001
Kids, the heart
is a mysterious muscle.

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,086
You never really know
what's going on in there.

3
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:07,538
So after Uncle Marshall
lost his father,

4
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:09,474
he decided to get
his heart checked.

5
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,042
And so did I...

6
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:12,877
and so did Lily...

7
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:15,080
and so did Robin.

8
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,682
And then Marshall went again,
just to be sure.

9
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:20,885
There was only one holdout.

10
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:22,721
I don't need to go
to a heart doctor.

11
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:26,324
I drink every day, I sleep
three hours every night,

12
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:27,993
and I have multiple
sex partners.

13
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,561
I'm doing everything right.

14
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,862
Barney, come on,
this is important.

15
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:32,731
We need you around
for a long time.

16
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,232
Without you, we'd have to find

17
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,368
some other sex-fueled,
depraved animal to entertain us.

18
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,435
Actually,

19
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,170
I'm thinking about
getting a dog again.

20
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,922
Oh, can she? Can she get
a dog, please Dad?

21
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:43,157
No. If you get a dog,

22
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:44,876
I'm going to be the one stuck
taking care of it.

23
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,578
You wouldn't have
to take care of it.

24
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,647
Really? And who watered
the philodendron

25
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,749
on your bookcase
and sang it back to life?

26
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,351
Yeah, that was made
out of silk, Ted.

27
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:56,854
Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed
something that buries a bone,

28
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:57,989
but I'm not talking
about a dog.

29
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,090
I'm talking about a man.

30
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:00,258
Here we go.

31
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,960
You're clearly trying to fill a hole...
in her heart.

32
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:05,830
You feel like the seventh wheel,
because now Ted is with Zoey

33
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,899
and Barney's with Nora
and Lily's with Big Fudge.

34
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,036
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge.

35
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,304
"With"?

36
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,407
I am not "with" Nora.

37
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,608
Wrong preposition.

38
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,944
Later tonight I'm hoping
to be on Nora, right?

39
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,813
Or under Nora, right?

40
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:23,948
Or, we're all adults,
I'll just say it...

41
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:25,850
behind Nora.

42
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,485
I don't know.

43
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:28,953
This will be your second date.

44
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:32,123
Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.

45
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:33,992
Yeah. Penis feelings.

46
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,193
Because she's hot.

47
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,678
Guys, as you know,

48
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,995
I only have one rule...

49
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:39,864
Barney said this a lot.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,269
if you're gonna get it on
in a Port-O-Potty,

51
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,987
do it early in the day.

52
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,174
Never screw over a girl
whose last name

53
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,843
ends in a vowel.

54
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:53,311
'Cause she's got brothers.

55
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:59,318
Never date a girl
with a hook for a hand.

56
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,489
Never go out with
the same girl more than once.

57
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,508
Then why are you going
out with Nora again?

58
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:07,992
There is an exception.

59
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:10,195
And it was always
the same exception.

60
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,764
...unless she's hot.

61
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,666
...unless she's hot.

62
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,169
...unless she's hot.
Arr!

63
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,839
And she is indeed hot.

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,909
Which is why nothing,
not even God himself...

65
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,861
yeah, I said it, Beardy...

66
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:30,115
is going to stand in the way
of tonight being legend...

67
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,983
Wait for it.

68
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,922
Uh-oh.

69
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:45,022

70
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,770
Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late.

71
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,871
I'm just, uh, just
getting over a cold.

72
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,573
Oh, no. How long
have you been sick?

73
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:57,842
About 20 minutes.
Can't seem to shake it.

74
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,245
Okay, 'cause I was going
to say you look a little...

75
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,414
Handsome? Rich?
Well-endowed?

76
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,020
Huh, let's say well-endowed...
with phlegm.

77
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,391
All right, let's go.
It's bedtime.

78
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,627
The bed...
that's where all the...

79
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,032
...happens.

80
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,534
Come on, let's get
you sorted out.

81
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,936
That night, Barney didn't
take care of business.

82
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,590
Instead, Nora took care
of Barney.

83
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,780
Ah. Thank you.

84
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,922
Good night, Barney.

85
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,458
Good night, Mommy.

86
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,093
Wow, she nursed you
back to health?

87
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,663
No. I didn't even
see her boobs.

88
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,232
She just took care of me.

89
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,702
Oh, hey, guys.
This is Nate.

90
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,604
- Nate, these are my friends.
- What's up. guys?

91
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,140
Nate Scooberman.
But everyone calls me Scooby.

92
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,542
I'd love to hang out,
but I really gotta hit the john.

93
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:06,311
Uh, yeah, it's right in here...

94
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,345
Scooby.

95
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,513
Thanks, brah.

96
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,214
I like you guys.

97
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,383
Oh, Robin,

98
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:15,553
if you weren't so much stronger
than me, I would slap you.

99
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:18,556
What? You told me
to meet someone.

100
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,758
I know, and, look,
he seems plenty nice,

101
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,793
but I didn't mean bring home
the first guy

102
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,395
you bump into on the street.

103
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,264
Actually, I met him in the park.

104
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,332
- Oh.
- Oh. -Oh.

105
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,967
Should have just
let you get a dog.

106
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,636
Oh, oh, I should go.
Lily, can I talk to you for a second?

107
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,809
So, um, I made an appointment
with that cardiologist.

108
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,444
Aw, and you want me
to go with you

109
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,678
'cause you're a little scared?

110
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,113
No.

111
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,649
Do you want me to go with you
because you're a lot scared?

112
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,850
Yes!

113
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,151
Okay, fine.

114
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,586
On one condition.

115
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:51,122
You have to promise me
you won't lie to Nora.

116
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,291
She seems like
something special.

117
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:57,629
Okay, I promise
I won't lie to her.

118
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,230
I may, however,
lie on her.

119
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,001
I said, bang-bang,
bangity-bang.

120
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,469
♪ Bang-bang-bang,
bangity-bang ♪

121
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,371
♪ Bang, bang,
bangity bang... ♪

122
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,923
Are we done?

123
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,142
♪ A bang-bang,
bangity-bang. ♪

124
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,510
Well, Barney,
your heart sounds fine.

125
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:14,612
See, Lily?

126
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,047
She was worried.

127
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,249
Although it seems like you might
have a slight arrhythmia.

128
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,919
Ow! Nails, nails!

129
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,287
It's probably nothing
to worry about,

130
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,589
but I'd like you to wear
this heart monitor

131
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,324
for the next 24 hours.

132
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,293
Twen... Flag on the play, Doc.

133
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,527
I have a date tonight.

134
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,095
Don't worry. It's totally safe.

135
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,530
Unless part of your big date

136
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,465
involves connecting yourself
to a car battery.

137
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,700
Well, now it doesn't.

138
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,706
And exactly 24 hours later,
they returned for the results.

139
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:45,159
Okay, everything
looks fine here,

140
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,645
although I did notice
a few irregularities.

141
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:49,847
There's nothing to be...

142
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:53,117
...alarmed about.

143
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:54,852
Go on, Doctor.

144
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:56,720
What happened

145
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:58,655
at 8:46 p.m. last night?

146
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:01,825
Well, let's see...

147
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:04,595
uh, Wheel of Fortune,
naked push-ups, naked chin-ups...

148
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,930
I was at dinner.

149
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,265
This might be a little forward,

150
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,834
but do you have a bomb
strapped to your chest?

151
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,303
This? No, no.

152
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:13,971
It's a heart monitor.

153
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,840
It's a medical thing.

154
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,342
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I've been trying

155
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:20,010
not to stare
at your chest all night.

156
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:22,179
What's that like?

157
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,114
So is everything okay?

158
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:28,052
My friend's dad passed away
from a sudden heart attack.

159
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,154
So I'm just getting
myself checked out, too.

160
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:32,089
Oh, I am so sorry.

161
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,758
Thanks.

162
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:39,563
Um, Barney, what
I'm about to say

163
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,799
is going to sound
a little weird,

164
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,636
but I think I'm starting to like you,
so I have to say it.

165
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,738
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm not easily shocked.

166
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,974
Unless you dump water on me,
'cause I'll just...

167
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,277
No. What is it?

168
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,945
I want to get married.

169
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,081
I mean, not tonight,

170
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,816
or even to you, necessarily.

171
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,618
But that's what I want.

172
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,253
And if that's going
to scare you off,

173
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:04,588
then I'd rather
it scare you off now.

174
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,123
I want a family,

175
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,292
and I want to live
in a little house

176
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:11,128
with a garden and a tree
for the kids to climb.

177
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,731
And I want to go
to sleep every night

178
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:15,666
with the same person
by my side,

179
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,769
and wake up next to him
in the morning every morning

180
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,971
for the rest of our lives.

181
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:23,207
Just thought
you should know that.

182
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:27,444
You have to promise me
you won't lie to Nora!

183
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:32,716
That's exactly
what I want, too.

184
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,598
I'm really into gardening, but these
squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes.

185
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,016
Every time I see them
in the backyard,

186
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:44,284
I'm like, "get out of here!"

187
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:45,769
And they run off,
but sure enough,

188
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,371
a few minutes later,
there they are again.

189
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:48,939
And I'm like,
"get out of here!"

190
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,706
So annoying.

191
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,508
I smell food.

192
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,476
Does this place have a kitchen?
I'll be right back.

193
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:59,148
Okay, but you have to admit

194
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,184
that he is a lot of fun.

195
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:02,252
Oh, I actually think

196
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:03,820
he's quite intelligent
for what he is.

197
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:04,954
And what is he?

198
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,022
He's a dog.

199
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:07,257
He's totally a dog.

200
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:09,025
What? You saw him
hitting on someone?

201
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,760
No, I didn't say,
"He a dawg."

202
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:13,596
I said, "He's a dog."
As in, a dog.

203
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:16,232
I think we've all noticed
a few curious mannerisms.

204
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:19,402
Or rather, doggerisms.

205
00:08:19,703 --> 00:08:22,739
Uh, Scooby, the tag's
still on your jeans.

206
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,407
Where?

207
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:34,901
Okay, Scooby, you ready?

208
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,787
Oh!

209
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:38,705
Good boy, Scooby!

210
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:41,023
- Good job, Scoob!
- Good boy!

211
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,693
- That last one did not happen.
- Okay, you're right.

212
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,027
He dropped it.

213
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:46,829
He's not a dog.

214
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,930
Robin, it's fine.

215
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,133
You said you wanted a dog
and you got one.

216
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:52,301
And the best part is,
he got his shots.

217
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:53,870
Hey, guys, got my shots.

218
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:55,037
You are so playful.

219
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:56,873
- Nice job fetching those.
- Guys...

220
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,091
Yeah, guys, cut it out.

221
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:59,175
Scooby, sit.

222
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:01,811
So, Scooby, we were thinking

223
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,379
if you're going to be
hanging out with our Robin,

224
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,747
you should be properly vetted.

225
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:08,884
Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness
doesn't give you "paws."

226
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,586
How did you meet?
Tell us the "tail""

227
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:12,455
Yes, how did you
"whisker" off her feet?

228
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:13,923
Shed a little light
on the matter.

229
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:16,225
Did you send her an e-mail,
or did you "collar"?

230
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,727
Guys, just stop hounding him.

231
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:19,862
Oh, geez.

232
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:20,897
No, no, you're right, Robin.

233
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,365
We don't want your
new guy to "flea."

234
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,467
We're just trying to make
sure he's not a heel.

235
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:26,335
So, moving from Canada,

236
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,404
that transition must have
been pretty "ruff."

237
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:31,107
Sure was. My part of Canada's
pretty different from New York.

238
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:33,576
Oh, I bet it was
an "Incredible Journey""

239
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:36,546
- What part of Canada is that? Speak.
- Labrador.

240
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,080
This isn't happening.

241
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:39,949
Hey, Nate,

242
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,084
why don't you go play
some music on the jukebox.

243
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,520
- No, I'm good.
- Oh, shoot, dropped my keys.

244
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,189
- I'll get 'em.
- Okay.

245
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,975
Hey, guys, this is Nora.

246
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:51,127
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you. - Hey.

247
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,428
- Nice to meet you.
- How's it going?

248
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,946
We were just passing by,

249
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:55,698
and I wanted to pop in
for two reasons.

250
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:57,099
First, I wanted to let you know

251
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,901
that your friend Barney
is being a perfect gentleman.

252
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,536
Well, it's still early.

253
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:01,938
I'm being serious.

254
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,507
I had no idea that deep down,
he's such a romantic.

255
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:06,776
I had no idea he
had a deep down.

256
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:08,544
Oh, you should have
heard him at dinner.

257
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:11,414
I mean, I like being single,

258
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:15,017
but secretly,
I want to have kids.

259
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:16,085
How many do you want?

260
00:10:16,086 --> 00:10:17,954
Three...
one of each.

261
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:19,388
You?

262
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,425
Three.
All in an old stone house.

263
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,960
Yeah, with ivy growing on it.

264
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:25,461
Cocktails on the patio.

265
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,096
And we must have a pool.

266
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:28,698
We?

267
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,934
A pool sounds brilliant.

268
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:34,837
Are you for real, Barney?

269
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:37,106
I really am.

270
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:39,809
Unbelievable.

271
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,877
I know, right?

272
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,311
And the second reason
we popped in

273
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:44,030
is 'cause I need
to use the loo.

274
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,498
But when I get back,

275
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:48,484
I'm dying to hear all about
Mr. Softy here.

276
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,820
I assure you, that's not
a nickname that I...

277
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:56,125
And that explains your
14-second cardiac arrest.

278
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,129
Barney, you promised
you wouldn't lie.

279
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,367
I'm not lying!
Guys, Nora's really special.

280
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,468
In fact...

281
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:07,303
I think I'm...

282
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:08,871
falling in love with her.

283
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,677
Guys! I'm serious.

284
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,178
I'm not going to
let you do this.

285
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:17,980
When Nora gets back here,
I'm blowing the whistle.

286
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:20,316
Just make sure it's not
a high-frequency whistle,

287
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:22,184
because we don't want to
torture Robin's boyfriend.

288
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:24,387
Guys, this is real.

289
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:27,189
And if you don't make me
look good in front of Nora,

290
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,258
just remember: I've got dirt
on each of you,

291
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,093
and I am not afraid to spill it.

292
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:34,163
Barney, you can't blackmail us
into lying to Nora.

293
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,431
Really, Lily?

294
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:38,234
Even if I were to mention,
oh, I don't know...

295
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:40,369
your kindergarten class's
pet guinea pig?

296
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,238
Mr. Buttons?

297
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:44,640
Oh, you son of a bitch.

298
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,075
Fine. I'll be nice.

299
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:48,144
- Marshall?
- You got nothing on me.

300
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,112
- The calzone?
- Checkmate.

301
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:51,814
Robin.

302
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:54,383
Don't say the Mr. T dream,
don't say the Mr. T dream,

303
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:55,618
don't say the Mr. T dream...

304
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:56,852
The Mr. T dream...

305
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,588
I'm lost.

306
00:11:58,589 --> 00:11:59,755
Ted?

307
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:01,757
Go ahead. Give me your best.

308
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,125
My life's an open book.

309
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:04,360
The ballet class.

310
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,662
I once took a ballet class.
Not ashamed.

311
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:08,431
The 'N Sync concert.

312
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:11,133
1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena,
front row. Caught JC's shirt.

313
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,702
What else you got?

314
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,704
Okay, Ted.

315
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:16,205
The thermos.

316
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:19,308
I suppose it's possible Barney
has real feelings for Nora.

317
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,961
I do!
So be cool!

318
00:12:24,247 --> 00:12:25,848
There's a man back there
who seems fascinated

319
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,550
by the records
flipping in the jukebox.

320
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:30,753
Sorry, toots.
He's taken.

321
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:33,689
So. How do you
all know Barney?

322
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,324
Oh, I don't know
how we know Barney.

323
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:37,526
How does anyone know
how they know anyone?

324
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:39,895
I like your pretty hair, help me.

325
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:43,733
We did not meet him
at a strip club.

326
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:44,867
No, sir.

327
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,769
Because...

328
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,438
Barney don't go
to no strip clubs.

329
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,574
Oh, come on. Barney's been
to a strip club once.

330
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:52,808
- Once?
- Thermos.

331
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,110
Nope. Not even once.

332
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:58,147
Really? So Barney really is
a genuinely a nice guy.

333
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:04,920
I don't recall.

334
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:07,523
Okay, I think that we're done
here, I think that we have

335
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:10,192
adequately established
that Barney is...

336
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:13,195
the kind of guy that you would
bring home to meet your parents.

337
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:15,398
Okay? So...
let's just drop it, all right?

338
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,649
It's funny you should say that,

339
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,101
because, as it happens,
my parents are in town.

340
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:21,037
They're only here
like once a year.

341
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:22,772
We're getting brunch tomorrow.

342
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:24,240
Do you want to meet them?

343
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,375
This was a big deal for Barney.

344
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:27,710
I only have one rule.

345
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,182
Never, ever, ever
meet a girl's parents.

346
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:35,785
Not even if she's hot?

347
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:38,521
Not even if her mom's hot.

348
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:40,456
I'd love to meet your parents.

349
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,292
It's a date.

350
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,095
Well, we should get going.
Walk me home?

351
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,263
Walk? Somebody say walk?

352
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:49,548
I'll go for a walk.
I love a good walk.

353
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,001
No, Scooby, you, uh...
stay!

354
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,907
Oh, no. I got called
back in to work.

355
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:00,309
Can you keep an eye
on him until I get back?

356
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,461
He's new to the city, and he
doesn't really know anyone.

357
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,780
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew if you got a dog,

358
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:07,066
- I'd wind up taking care of it.
- He's not a...

359
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:10,236
Good night.

360
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:13,723
What do we do now?

361
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:15,491
Oh! I got an idea.

362
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:18,561
I was in the park today, and
this guy sold me a big bag of...

363
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:21,731
Kids, it was a big bag
of sandwiches.

364
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,433
- Whoa.
- Put that away.

365
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:27,336
- You guys want to fire these up?
- Scooby, we're in our 30s.

366
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:29,205
We don't smoke
sandwiches anymore.

367
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:31,340
- Sandwich brownies?
- Okay.

368
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,411
Sandwiches make me hungry.

369
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,747
Truth.
Hey.

370
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:39,148
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

371
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,185
What did Barney mean
when he said "calzone"?

372
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:46,822
- Okay, I'll tell you.
- Okay.

373
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:51,727
One time Barney saw me drop
a calzone on the sidewalk,

374
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:53,529
pick it up,
and then keep eating it.

375
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,032
- It feels so good to finally say that
out loud. I... - Dude.

376
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,734
Listen to me.

377
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:01,070
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

378
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,239
That calzone sounds amazing.

379
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:10,045
Guys, I found this on the floor.

380
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:12,047
Oh, my God.

381
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:13,783
Scooby ate the whole tray.

382
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:15,117
Ruh-roh!

383
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:18,554
Wait. Where is he, anyway?

384
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:19,972
Oh, dude.

385
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:21,590
Scooby got out!

386
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,078
Here we are.

387
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,066
I had a really
great time tonight.

388
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:31,868
Yeah, me, too.

389
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,876
Do you want to come upstairs?

390
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:44,180
I'd love to.

391
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,850
There's just one little thing,

392
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:50,119
and it probably
doesn't matter, but...

393
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,620
I don't want to get married.

394
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:54,356
I've been saying that all night
just to get in your pants.

395
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:56,959
Whoa!

396
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:59,595
Oh! Ahh!

397
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:02,344
Can you believe...

398
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:11,314
- Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.
- Oh, no!

399
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:14,079
That means the poor guy's
out there with no identification.

400
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,083
Robin! Hey. Hey, um, remember Scooby?
Uh, well, he got out.

401
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:19,351
"Got out"? What do you mean?

402
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,919
He just walked out
of the apartment.

403
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,388
Someone must've
left the door open.

404
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:23,856
- It wasn't me.
- Me neither.

405
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,526
He must've figured out
how to open it himself.

406
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:28,760
He's so smart.

407
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,729
We should get him
on Letterman doing tricks.

408
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,314
I know Paul Schaffer's

409
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:33,832
sandwich guy.
This could happen.

410
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,568
Guys. Get yourselves together
and start looking for Scooby.

411
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,070
I'm on my way home.

412
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,738
Wait wait! Robin.

413
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:41,490
Can you pick up some calzones?

414
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,577
Wait... Nora, wait. Wait.

415
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,713
I'm sorry I misled you.

416
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,715
Misled? You lied to me!

417
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,283
You had your friends lie to me!

418
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:54,586
- I was on the spot. This is your fault.
- My fault?

419
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,755
Yeah, with the whole "I want
to get married" thing.

420
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:59,725
You can't just tell someone
exactly what you want

421
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,059
out of a relationship.

422
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,696
This... isn't England.

423
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:08,333
Good-bye, Barney.

424
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:11,803
Scooby!

425
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:13,155
Scoob!

426
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:16,208
- Great idea.
- No, great idea!

427
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,709
Okay. If you were new in town

428
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,329
and had just ingested an eighth
of sandwich, where would you go?

429
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,182
Of course.

430
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:24,783
Back to the pizza place!

431
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,318
Yeah! Maybe that's
where Scooby went.

432
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,786
Who's Scooby?

433
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,322
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, have you seen Scooby?

434
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:33,158
Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking
a leak on that fire hydrant?

435
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,495
Scooby!

436
00:17:36,496 --> 00:17:39,264
Oh, hey! It's my friends!

437
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:41,667
No!

438
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:45,504
And that explains 12:51 a.m.

439
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:47,506
Okay. None of this suggests
a systemic issue.

440
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,840
Your heart's fine.

441
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,643
With a healthy diet, you can
live a long and happy life.

442
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:53,512
If nobody stabs you.

443
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:55,147
Day's not over.

444
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:57,282
Okay.

445
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:01,286
Lily, I'm sorry that I lied
about wanting to settle down.

446
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,255
No, that wasn't the lie.

447
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,791
The lie was when you told Nora
you were lying.

448
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,226
Because you weren't.

449
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,995
You want that stuff, Barney,
I know you do.

450
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:16,084
Okay. Maybe, eventually,
I could settle down.

451
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:19,638
50 years from now, if I have
like a Hefner thing going on

452
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,173
with some really hot twins.

453
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:22,741
But those twins

454
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:27,613
won't even be born
for another... 32 years.

455
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:28,981
I mean...

456
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,818
Nora's great.
She's wonderful. But...

457
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,520
What time was
your dinner reservation?

458
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,355
Last night? 8:30.

459
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,790
What did his heart do at 8:30?

460
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:53,038
It... literally
skipped a beat.

461
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:56,308
Your heart's talking to you,
Barney.

462
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,443
Do you have the guts
to listen to it?

463
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:21,166
- I lied.
- Barney.

464
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,835
When I said I lied,
that was a lie, and I'm sorry.

465
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:25,837
- I'm confused.
- So am I.

466
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:29,308
This, all of this,
this is totally new to me,

467
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,310
but I know it's what I want.

468
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:32,978
I want to be confused.

469
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:34,846
With you.

470
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:42,654
Mom, Dad...

471
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,256
this is Barney.

472
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:45,524
Hi.

473
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,859
I'm Barney.
Great to meet you.

474
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,845
Hey, you want to see
a magic trick?
