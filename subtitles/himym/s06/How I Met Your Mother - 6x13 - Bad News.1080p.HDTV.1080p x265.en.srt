1
00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:02,995
<i>Kids, when Lily and Marshall
started trying to have a baby,</i>

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,337
<i>they went a little crazy.</i>

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,772
We've been trying and trying,

4
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:09,374
and still nothing's happened.

5
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:12,094
I'm just worried
we can't have children.

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,431
- And how long have you been trying?
- Six days.

7
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:21,187
<i>But then, months went by,
and still nothing happened.</i>

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,697
Something must be wrong.

9
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,926
We're doing it a lot.

10
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:26,392
And everywhere...

11
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:29,217
the kitchen, the bathroom,
the living room,

12
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:31,614
outside in your wait... the kitchen.

13
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,907
Seriously, Doc,

14
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,784
why isn't this happening?

15
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,518
Look, if you're really worried,

16
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:40,481
here is a number for a reproductive
endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel.

17
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,633
He's the best in the city.

18
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,935
I don't know, baby,
do we really need a specialist?

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,542
What's your plan, Marshall,

20
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:50,424
just have unprotected sex
day after day after day

21
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,042
in every position imaginable
until...?

22
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:55,974
Wait, it sounded worse in my head.

23
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,391
Guys, we've got a problem.

24
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,903
This is the application
for the regional doubles

25
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,182
laser tag tournament
in Poughkeepsie.

26
00:01:04,307 --> 00:01:06,524
Problem is,
only one of you can be my partner.

27
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,970
So it looks like
we've got a bake-off.

28
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:11,778
- You may now present your arguments.
- I'm not playing laser tag.

29
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,823
- I'm absolutely not playing.
- Damn it.

30
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,950
And Marshall's the winner.

31
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:19,203
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel.
It can't hurt.

32
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:22,289
<i>So Aunt Lily went
to see Dr. John Stangel,</i>

33
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>the man who knew more about human
reproduction than anyone in New York.</i>

34
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,588
So, I understand
you want to get pregnant.

35
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,484

40
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:47,857
Yeah, and it cuts in and out.

41
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:49,775
How did you do it?

42
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,624
God, you found one of the cameras.

43
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:55,156
I swear that's the only one.
Wait, which one did you find?

44
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,908
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

45
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,078
My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.

46
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,079
We'll look at all the factors
that contribute to fertility:

47
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,525
dietary, environmental, genetic.

48
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,419
But first, Ms. Aldrin,

49
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:11,139
do you have any questions for me?

50
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,884
Just one, "Dr. Stangel."

51
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:15,551
Where'd you get the beard?

52
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,151
Well...

53
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,441
My mother's Armenian.

54
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,058
I've been with Barney
since 9:00 a.m.

55
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,547
Between the sexual harassment
seminar all morning

56
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:27,729
and the secretary beauty
pageant all afternoon,

57
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:29,273
he hasn't left my sight.

58
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:33,736
So you weren't wearing a fake beard
and examining girl parts all day?

59
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,756
Not today I wasn't.

60
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:40,374
We finally found Barney's doppelganger.
I guess we can tell you now, Lily.

61
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:43,537
That hot dog guy
did not look like Barney.

62
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,208
I know, we made our little deal
with the universe...

63
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,227
No, we've made a binding covenant
with the universe.

64
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,366
We said we weren't
gonna try to have kids

65
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,173
until we saw Barney's doppelganger.

66
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,667
This is bad news.

67
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,842
This is like a black cat
walked through my uterus.

68
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,267
Okay, that's it.

69
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:04,600
I am going back to Dr. Stangel
and getting thoroughly checked out.

70
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,921
Or cost-saving alternative:

71
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:10,131
you could get checked out
by someone who looks just like him.

72
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,495
I'm gonna go scrub up,
I'll meet you in stall 3.

73
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,572
- I still kind of think it's Barney.
- There's no way it's Barney.

74
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,784
Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen.
I am Dr. Stangel.

75
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,035
It's Barney.

76
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,528
Really, dude, bravo.

77
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:29,124
You almost got a peek.

78
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,376
But seriously,

79
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:33,128
what second-rate community
theater did you get...?

80
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:34,964
Would you...?

81
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,301
So my wife and I
are trying to get pregnant.

82
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,475
Put your feet up in the stirrups.
We can begin.

83
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,435
- No, can't do it.
- No, but, baby,

84
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,146
I yanked on his beard.
He checks out.

85
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,690
I don't have time for this.

86
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,209
Wait, please... It's...

87
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,653
Can you just give us
a couple minutes?

88
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,971
How can I convince you
that this is not Barney?

89
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:08,032
It is like looking into
a poorly dressed mirror.

90
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:15,322
Okay, you have to go.

91
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:19,941
Leave the model of the vagina.

92
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,346
Convinced.

93
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,229
Great. All right,
you're a little low on the table.

94
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,673
- Please scoot up.
- "Suit up"... not convinced.

95
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:31,937
This whole thing
stinks to high heaven.

96
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,119
Baby, you just saw Barney.

97
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:36,567
He could have pulled
some crazy switch.

98
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,361
Remember when his Swedish
cousin came to visit?

99
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:41,280
Yeah... Bjorney.

100
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,349
I'm sorry, but unless I see
Barney at the same time,

101
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:48,412
I'll never be sure
that Dr. Stangel isn't him.

102
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
How you doing?!

103
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,467
Should I have a boner?!

104
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,154
We're all done. I'll call you
in a few days with the results.

105
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,673
You don't mind
if I take pictures, do you?!

106
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,843
Can we leave him in here
for a while?

107
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,220
I'm done for the day.
You can leave him in here all night.

108
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,234
Smile for the birdie, Lil!

109
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,079
Gyno-mite!

110
00:05:16,244 --> 00:05:17,858
<i> Now, while all this was going on,</i>

111
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,028
<i>your Aunt Robin was starting
her new job at World Wide News,</i>

112
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,404
<i>aka the big leagues.</i>

113
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:24,044
<i>She was excited.</i>

114
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,533
<i>This job was a new start,
a clean slate. </i>

115
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,882
So, first day of work?

116
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:35,250
Everyone, say hello to your new
research associate Robin Scherbatsky.

117
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,961
- Hi, guys.
- Welcome.

118
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,879
Here comes our new Hardfire host.

119
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:41,588
Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.

120
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,304
<i>Robin's old cohost
and my old nemesis.</i>

121
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:49,361
We should have sex.

122
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,726
- I hate that guy.
- It gets worse.

123
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:54,353
Sandy, this is...

124
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,023
- You two know each other?
- Know each other?

125
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,233
We've had sex.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,944
You had sex with Sandy Rivers?

127
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:05,648
And I can't believe
it's my first day,

128
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:08,283
and already I'm the girl
who slept with the host of the show.

129
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,120
Already? Were you planning on
eventually sleeping with the host?

130
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,539
Now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.

131
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,923
There's a couple messages
on the machine. Your dad called.

132
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,967
He wants to know if
you have any sixes.

133
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:27,757
We got a game of "Go Fish"
going on the phone.

134
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,916
P.S., Pops, go fish.

135
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,351
Who's the second message from?

136
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:36,061
Dr. Stangel's office.

137
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,315
- I'm extremely fertile.
- You're extremely fertile! My God!

138
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,622
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

139
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,282
I gotta call my dad
and tell him the good news.

140
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,807
If you're fertile,

141
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,791
then that means I'm the problem.

142
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,757
Okay, now you're being ridiculous.

143
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,325
An hour ago, you didn't even think
there was a problem.

144
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,254
I was just putting on a brave face.
Okay, think about it:

145
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,000
we've had unprotected sex

146
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,463
203 times in the past four months.

147
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,227
Obviously I'm the problem.

148
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,395
Problem?!

149
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,606
You can't get a girl pregnant.
That's the dream.

150
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,860
I'd give my firstborn
to not be able to have children.

151
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,739
So, second day of work?

152
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,578
What's wrong?

153
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:33,552
You didn't hear?
She's the office slut.

154
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,829
Already? Honey...

155
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,415
I wish I was the office slut.

156
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:42,147
And we can explore how
those policy changes will affect Iraq.

157
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:47,424
We definitely had sex.

158
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,842
We did not have sex.

159
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,427
Then why do I remember you?

160
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,345
I don't know, maybe because I'm
a smart, talented, professional.

161
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,016
No, none of those.

162
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,144
I remember.
We didn't have sex.

163
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,312
Thank you.

164
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,697
You're the girl who did the report
on the carriage driver

165
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:05,734
and slipped
and fell in horse poop...

166
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,202
We did have sex.

167
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:08,737
I remember now.

168
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,116
Do me a favor.

169
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,077
<i>But this reporter takes pride in...</i>

170
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,915
And now everyone
calls me Scherpoopie.

171
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,876
It's not funny.

172
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,803
A word of advice: play along.

173
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:27,339
Okay, the more you fight it,
the worse it's going to get.

174
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:30,217
It's like when your car slides on ice,
you steer into the skid.

175
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,049
Exactly!
Or when your... I don't know...

176
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:35,824
friend invites you to a laser tag
tournament, you don't fight it.

177
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,203
You just strap on the vinyl holster
and race into that abandoned JCPenney

178
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:40,602
guns a-blazin'.

179
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,479
I'm just agreeing with Ted.

180
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,358
It's my dad.

181
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,340
Aren't you gonna get it?

182
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:56,365
No, you know what? I'm gonna get
my stuff checked out first.

183
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,912
I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel
gives me the thumbs up.

184
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,979
He has to do that?

185
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,001
But I thought you talk
to your dad about everything.

186
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,356
I only like to call
my dad with good news.

187
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:09,173
I mean, telling him good news
is what makes it feel real to me.

188
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:11,413
I'm getting married!

189
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,596
- I passed the bar!
- All right!

190
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:19,229
I found an amazing Viking lamp
that fits right on the coffee table,

191
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,460
as long as we don't mind
stepping over the cord.

192
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:23,636
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Right?!

193
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,489
I found someone who can
fix the Viking lamp!

194
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:33,010
But the news that I might not be able
to give him a grandchild?

195
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:36,450
You know, like, I don't even know
how to have that conversation.

196
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:38,199
I'll show you.

197
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:42,331
Dad, there's, there's something
I need to tell you,

198
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,354
and it's going to come
as a bit of a shock to you,

199
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,602
but here goes.

200
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:51,082
You are speaking
to the 2011 Tri-County

201
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:52,716
Laser Tag Co-Champion.

202
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,968
- I've already told...
- And my sperm don't work.

203
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,425
The <i>laser tag thing</i> is awesome.

204
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:04,395
So, third day of work?

205
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,855
And the fertilizer is seeping
into the ground water, causing...

206
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,736
Is Scherpoopie pitching
a story about manure?

207
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,864
Genius.

208
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:20,044
Yes, I fell into some manure.

209
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,553
It's hilarious, fine.

210
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,822
In a five-year career
of on-air reports,

211
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:26,250
there are bound to be a
few embarrassing moments.

212
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,418
A few?

213
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,825
But in my case, it was just the one,

214
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:34,401
and you found it, so...

215
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:35,759
Just the one.

216
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,931
Oh, God.

217
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,549
What did they find?

218
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,359
Everything.

219
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:53,659
<i>Everybody, come and play</i>

220
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,646
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.

221
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:02,494
VENTILATEUR GEANT !

222
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:06,592
The Federal Reserve Board
voted to leave interest...

223
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:22,597
They even found the video of me
getting attacked by an owl.

224
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,308
You got attacked by an owl?

225
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,476
I did not get attacked by an owl.

226
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,729
Robin, here's what you need to do...

227
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,573
Don't you dare tell me
to steer into the skid, okay?

228
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,735
It's too late. I'm already
wrapped around a hydro pole.

229
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,048
It's a Canadian telephone pole.
I never should have taken this job.

230
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:41,261
<i>Kids, at that moment,</i>

231
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:43,718
<i>I knew what I had to do
for my friend Robin.</i>

232
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:45,742
<i>But first I had to do
something for me.</i>

233
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,108
Show me...

234
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,389
"owl attack."

235
00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:52,002
I am freaking out.

236
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,070
Is there a chance
that I can't have kids?

237
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,922
I've been hit in the nuts a lot.

238
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,739
We won't know anything
until we run some tests.

239
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:00,860
We'll need a sample of your sperm.

240
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,929
No, there's a room
at the end of the hall.

241
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,126
If you find yourself in the elevator,
you've gone too far.

242
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,183
You'd think I wouldn't have to say that,
but you'd be surprised.

243
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:15,817
All yours, buddy.

244
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,871
The thing you're
about to do in here...

245
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,427
I did that in here, too.

246
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:33,335
Three minutes ago.

247
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,254
I was here eight minutes ago.

248
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,049
14 minutes ago.

249
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:42,677
I'm here every Thursday.

250
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:47,641
I can't do it, Doc.

251
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,769
Is there another option?
Could I take this home?

252
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:52,545
Sure, you could,

253
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,840
but we close in an hour
and I'm not back till Tuesday.

254
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,526
So, clock is ticking. Make it fast.

255
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,509
Only way I know how, Doc.

256
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:02,761
Only way I know how.

257
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,621
Surprise!

258
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,478
Mom. Dad.

259
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:18,379
What are you doing here?

260
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,181
We hadn't heard from you in two days.
We were worried about you.

261
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:23,192
For God's sake.
Do you have any sixes?

262
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:24,718
Go fish.

263
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,601
Excuse me.

264
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:28,898
Can I just talk to you in
here for a minute?

265
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:32,268
Isn't it great?
They just showed up.

266
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,479
Your mom's already
rearranged my kitchen,

267
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,200
organized my closet

268
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,602
and she asked me if I lost height.

269
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:40,054
Not weight. Height.

270
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,297
I'm very excited
that they're here, too.

271
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,207
But right now, I have to get excited
about something else.

272
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,585
Okay.
Well, I'll go handle your parents.

273
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,751
And you handle your, well...

274
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,914
Wait, Marshall.

275
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,293
Thank you, baby. You're the best.

276
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,912
I just got my new bathing suit
for the beach this summer.

277
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:08,345
It's a two-piece.
I mean, can you imagine?

278
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:09,847
<i>Me in a two-piece</i>

279
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,518
bathing suit at my age?

280
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,683
Just picture it!

281
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,901
<i>Picture it!</i>

282
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,700
That's why Fred Cox

283
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,688
is the greatest kicker
the Vikings ever had.

284
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,584
Seriously, Marshall, picture it.

285
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:23,194
<i>Just picture it.</i>

286
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,698
Give me a <i>C</i>. Give me an <i>O</i>.
Give me an <i>X</i>.

287
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,935
What's that spell?

288
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,282
Cox! Cox!

289
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,373
Okay, I did a bad thing last night.

290
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:39,335
- I looked up his address.
- Who?

291
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,988
Sorry. You said "who."

292
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:45,633
It reminded me of the owl footage.
Genius.

293
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,946
Sandy.
How dare he laugh at you.

294
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,289
Who does he think...

295
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:51,680
Sorry. "Who."

296
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:55,976
Anyway. I looked up his address
in your contact list.

297
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:57,978
God. Tell me you
didn't go over there.

298
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,293
I just thought...

299
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,191
he needed to listen to common sense
and reasonable discourse.

300
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,568
God. Tell me those aren't
the names of your fists.

301
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,530
They're my feet.
I'm more of a kicker.

302
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,783
So I went to his apartment.

303
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:24,403
You're not the pizza guy.

304
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:30,796
Oh, my God. This is...

305
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,761
This is how you make sure Sandy
never makes fun of you again.

306
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:36,392
I told you to steer into the skid.
That was bad advice.

307
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,653
So new advice.

308
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,740
Steer into Sandy, and run him down.

309
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:43,107
If people found out
Sandy wears a toupee...

310
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,152
Really? That's your take-away?
Nothing on the bear in the bra?

311
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:48,908
No. He's very open about that.

312
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:50,161
That's Gregory.

313
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:51,365
Nice guy.

314
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,535
And the top is so low-cut.

315
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,911
Your father says he has

316
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,789
front-row seats
to the Minnesota Twins.

317
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,090
By the way, Marshall,
we do need to know

318
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,921
if you're coming to Florida this summer.
Are you coming?

319
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,054
Marshall, are you coming?

320
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,274
This isn't working.

321
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:17,308
- Where you going, son?
- I'm going to...

322
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:19,908
I'm going to...

323
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,883
<i>Kids, to this day,</i>

324
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:24,732
<i>your uncle Marshall is thankful
for what Lily said next.</i>

325
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,641
He's going to masturbate.

326
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,278
Marshall, tell them what's going on.

327
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:32,647
<i>And so Marshall told his parents
everything.</i>

328
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:37,202
Now, I'm scared that we won't be able
to give you a grandchild.

329
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:41,999
We don't care about that one bit.

330
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:44,585
And if you guys want kids,

331
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:46,935
there are other ways.
Adoption.

332
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:50,486
Maybe you have a good friend
who could loan you some sperm?

333
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:58,015
Maybe adoption.

334
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,009
What I'm saying is,

335
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:03,520
we love you no matter what.

336
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:08,343
Why don't you pretend
you're in high school,

337
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,041
get back in that bathroom,

338
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,237
and "blow dry your hair."

339
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:14,938
Wait, you knew?

340
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:16,939
We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.

341
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:20,454
So?

342
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:22,676
Possibly last day of work?

343
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,501
Actually, it was a good day.

344
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,887
And I need more numbers
on how the holiday season

345
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:30,338
impacted the economy.

346
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:33,467
Sparkles, got anything on malls?

347
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:37,913
Actually, Sandy,

348
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,634
I have something I think
you're all gonna want to see.

349
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,615
Yes! Put him in a body bag!

350
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,315
- I didn't do it.
- What?

351
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,860
I didn't want to just attack someone
out of the blue like some kind of...

352
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:52,778
Owl?

353
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,026
Exactly.

354
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,074
So, instead of taking your advice,

355
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:57,700
I took your advice.

356
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:04,266
<i>That day, Robin decided
to steer into the skid.</i>

357
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:07,595
<i>And though she never quite
shook the nickname,</i>

358
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,561
<i>Sparkles went on to do very well
at World Wide News.</i>

359
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,917
<i>Especially after this happened.</i>

360
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:20,571
<i>After his parents had gone
back to Minnesota,</i>

361
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:22,224
<i>Marshall got the results.</i>

362
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,018
I'm afraid I have
some very bad news, Marshall.

363
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:29,216
Judging from the results
of your test, it is...

364
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:32,860
it is very unlikely that you'll be able
to father a child.

365
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:36,181
- Oh, God.
- I know, I know.

366
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:37,749
It's just...

367
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:39,085
Now...

368
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,291
in some rare cases,

369
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,682
a regimen change
can fix the problem,

370
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:47,207
so I'm recommending
a spirited cardio routine.

371
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:49,594
Preferably with a partner,

372
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:52,393
involving any light-based
firearm activity

373
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:53,876
in the Tri-State area.

374
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,383
Poughkeepsie, for example.

375
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:00,557
Have you heard of the gentlemen's sport
known as laser tag?

376
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:03,599
Surprise!

377
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,017
Damn it, Barney!

378
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,879
What are you doing in here?

379
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:10,135
Think about it, Marshall. All entrants
get 20% off at the snack bar!

380
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,734
BT-dub, the receptionist.
What's her situation?

381
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,130
Go!

382
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:20,783
Well, Marshall.
I've got your results.

383
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:22,868
And?

384
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:25,788
Your sperm is fine.

385
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,664
My sperm is fine!

386
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:31,901
Count, motility...

387
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:34,235
everything's off the charts.

388
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,425
You, sir, have got
some strong swimmers.

389
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:41,742
Bro, that is awesome.
Motility five!

390
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:47,374
Can I borrow your phone?
I want to call my dad.

391
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:48,393
Go ahead.

392
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,681
Man, this is great.

393
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,760
I was expecting bad news.

394
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,035
I really was.

395
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:11,816
You're here!

396
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:13,057
Oh, my God!

397
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:15,087
I love you so much!
Can you believe it?

398
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:19,675
Something's happened.

399
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,012
Your father, he had a heart attack.

400
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,700
He didn't make it.

401
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:35,482
My dad's dead?

402
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,817
I'm not ready for this.

9999
