1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:02,656
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:05,339
<i>it seemed like Aunt Lily could only
talk about one thing,</i>

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:06,464
babies.

4
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,342
God, I have been craving
this burger all day.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,803
Do you know what plays a huge role
in helping a woman conceive?

6
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:14,405
Cervical mucus.

7
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:19,728
God, I can't wait to see this movie.
I hear it's really scary.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,020
Change of plans.

9
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:24,231
I thought violent images
wouldn't be good for my future fetus,

10
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:28,319
so instead, I rented
this video of a live water birth.

11
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:34,844
They don't know what it is.
It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,369
Look at this crib.

13
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:38,735
<i>But all in all, it wasn't a problem.</i>

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,587
<i>That is, until the night
of Barney's boutonniere.</i>

15
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:43,834
- You're wearing a flower.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,961
- Didn't compliment. Just observed.
- I know.

17
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:49,170
- Why are you wearing that?
- Why does Barney do anything ever?

18
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,242
Exactly. Science.

19
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,420
There is an 83% correlation

20
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:57,139
between the times men wear boutonnieres
and the times they get laid.

21
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,095
Think about it. Proms,

22
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:00,571
weddings,

23
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:03,187
grandmas' funerals,
thanks for the redhead, Nana.

24
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,998
The "everyday boutonniere"

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,520
by Stinson.

26
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,060
And nope.

27
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,139
I'm sorry, Barney,
but no girl is going home

28
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:13,025
with a guy with a flower
on his chest.

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,533
Unless he's a clown,
and she's in the trunk of his car.

30
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,951
Along with 50 other clowns.

31
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:22,344
It's a clown car.

32
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:25,772
Robin, did you know that <i>boutonniere</i>

33
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:28,334
is French for "bootie is near?"

34
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:29,915
True story.

35
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:32,123
<i>Une histoire vraie.</i>

36
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,339
Did you know that Barney is French

37
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,910
for "sad little guy who works
way too hard to get laid".

38
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,878
- Woman, you best check yourself.
- On the bright side,

39
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:42,269
I guess suits are pretty boring
without them, so...

40
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,394
Madam,

41
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,646
that is an insult
that cannot be borne!

42
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,732
I demand satisfaction!

43
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,567
What, are we gonna duel?

44
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,486
No. I'm gonna show everyone
this embarrassing video of you.

45
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:55,275
It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!

51
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:13,591

had been a teen pop sensation</i>

52
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:16,195
<i>in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles.</i>

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,489
<i>And we also knew
that her Robin Sparkles character</i>

54
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:21,148
<i>came from a Canadian TV show,
which we'd never seen...</i>

55
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,081
<i>until now.</i>

56
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,269
I cannot wait
to see what's on this DVD!

57
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,484
- You haven't watched it yet?
- Of course not.

58
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:30,209
I wanted my first time to be
with someone I cared about.

59
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,242
I get that a lot.
Well, once.

60
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:35,946
Robin, do you want to go get
a Korean massage on Saturday?

61
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,116
I'd love to. I've got this knot
in my neck that's so annoying.

62
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,906
I figured I should get one now

63
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,370
because once I get pregnant,
no more massages.

64
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,080
Just so annoying.

65
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,754
Space Teens?

66
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,422
Is this a porno?

67
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,799
- No, dude.
- Sweet!

68
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,383
It's a kids' show.

69
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,976
This does have
all the earmarks of porn.

70
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,292
Stripper pole, bad lighting,

71
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,981
delusional girl who thinks
it's a stepping stone to success.

72
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,484
Yeah, it's a big old bowl
of "pornflakes".

73
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:24,470
And who is this exquisite keytarist

74
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,330
I assume you're about
to make love to?

75
00:03:26,843 --> 00:03:30,334
That's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF
on the show and in real life.

76
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:32,071
BFFs.

77
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:35,123
Did you guys have sleepovers?
Get mad at each other and wrestle,

78
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,341
but then end up kissing
in a tender embrace?

79
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,926
Show us on Lily.

80
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,095
If you're gonna be disgusting,
we're not watching this.

81
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,312
Come on, Barney.
It's just a cute little story about...

82
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,351
What exactly is this about?

83
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,272
Two average Canadian teenagers
who solve crimes in space using math.

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,690
That sounds ridiculous.

85
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,858
So sue me.

86
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,443
Like the producers
of <i>Milky Way Mathletes</i> tried to.

87
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:08,132
Great job using long division

88
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:09,951
to catch that space burglar, eh?

89
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,171
What can I say?

90
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:14,947
He'll be in galactic jail
for the remainder of his life.

91
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,634
Sparkles, Glitter, we're about
to enter an asteroid belt, eh.

92
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:23,426
Brace for turbulence!

93
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,893
I have to say, as much as I hate

94
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,356
to agree with Barney,

95
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:33,063
this does seem to be
a veritable "pornucopia".

96
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:35,422
Guys, come on.
It's a kids' show!

97
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:38,402
Like <i>Electric Company</i>
or <i>Sesame Street</i> or...

98
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,686
- You can't do that on television.
- Exactly.

99
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,908
You can't do that on television!

100
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,535
This show is so dirty,
I don't know whether to hug you

101
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,128
or run a shower so you can sit there
alone, crying and clenching your knees.

102
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,726
It's just bad camera work, okay?

103
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,925
Wayne, our camera guy,
he wasn't that great.

104
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,595
I don't know. He did a pretty good job,
considering he was only using one hand.

105
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,759
You know what?
I feel bad for you Americans,

106
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:12,484
that you can look at this wondrous
and educational adventure through space,

107
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,108
and see something obscene.

108
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,697
Can you just,
please, try to look at this

109
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:18,400
with the innocence of a child?

110
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,445
- Innocence of a child.
- Coming up. Here we go.

111
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,866
Girls, if you want to get through
the asteroid belt, you've got

112
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,409
to use multiplication.

113
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:29,015
To the joystick!

114
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,091
Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply!

115
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,466
Five times six?

116
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,703
30.

117
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,545
Seven times four?

118
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,798
- 28!
- Keep going!

119
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,091
Eight times nine?

120
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,103
- 72!
- Don't stop now!

121
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,346
Almost there!

122
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,804
23 times three?

123
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,433
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,283
We got to ration this.
It's like we're on a desert island,

125
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:57,128
and this video is a really hot,
naked chick, and she's got, like,

126
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,722
seaweed on her and a seashell bra.

127
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:00,943
You all feel me?

128
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,406
If you and Jessica are BFFs,
how come we've never met her?

129
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:08,255
It was a long time ago, okay?
I get a Christmas card

130
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,828
from her every year, but,
we're not really friends anymore.

131
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,034
But BFFs are forever.

132
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:16,041
Come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends
with their high school friends.

133
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,496
- I'm still friends with Punchy.
- Dude, he lives in Cleveland.

134
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:21,505
You see him once a year,
at which point,

135
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,365
he punches you really
hard in the arm

136
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,518
and tells everyone
how you dookied your pants.

137
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:28,679
I know, on paper he sounds great,
but you guys aren't really friends.

138
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:32,376
Look, I may not see him a lot,
but it doesn't matter.

139
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:33,998
Observe.

140
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,772
- Schmosby!
- Punchy!

141
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,310
- Good talking to you.
- You, too.

142
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:46,363
- If you're ever in New York.
- Definitely.

143
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:49,665
We are just two peas.

144
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:54,407
I don't get it. How can you
and Glitter just stop being friends?

145
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:55,831
Best friends don't do that.

146
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,126
We did. And I haven't talked to her
in, like, five years, so just drop it.

147
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:01,164
I got to go.

148
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:09,053
What do you think came
between Robin and Jessica?

149
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,347
Much like our friends,
the Space Teens,

150
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,850
I think I can solve this crime

151
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,143
with math.

152
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,520
Here is a Christmas card
that Jessica sent Robin.

153
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:25,486
- How old would you say that kid is?
- Four years, three months.

154
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:29,085
Which means Jessica got pregnant
five years ago, right around the time

155
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,576
- she and Robin stopped being friends.
- Of course. Robin hates kids.

156
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,412
The last thing she would wanna do
is hang out with some little brat.

157
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,325
Thus, if I may...

158
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,641
When Glitter's womb
a fruit did bear,

159
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,309
Robin said,

160
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:46,173
"To hell with this, I'm outta hare."

161
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,754
Glitter got pregnant,
so Robin dumped her.

162
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,139
That's got to be it, right, Lil?

163
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,034
Robin's gonna dump me!

164
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,808
Sweetheart.

165
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,108
When a second uterus
plumped becomes...

166
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,276
Dude.

167
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,087
Feel the room.

168
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:20,747
We've been waiting all day!

169
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,332
Just watch it without me.

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,168
Two dudes on the couch together
watching porn? That's kind of weird.

171
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,045
It's not porn, it's a kids' show.

172
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:30,006
Two dudes watching a kids'
show might be worse.

173
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,718
Fine, I'll watch it with you.
But if either of you makes

174
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:36,661
even one peep about the show
being dirty, I'm turning it off.

175
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:37,886
I'm serious.

176
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:43,228
Jessica, how's your beaver?

177
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,690
Great.
How's your beaver?

178
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:48,787
Busy as ever!

179
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,822
Our characters had pet beavers.

180
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:53,947
Sure.

181
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,700
The beaver
is the official animal of Canada.

182
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:58,910
It's our national mascot.

183
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,930
It's a noble creature.

184
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:07,299
Okay, girls. Everyone knows
a beaver's favorite food is wood.

185
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,074
I just hope we brought along
enough of it

186
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,105
for our three-day
galactic space journey.

187
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,780
So let's do the math.

188
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:17,554
If Robin's beaver devours
six inches of wood every half hour,

189
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:22,274
and Jessica's beaver devours
eight inches of wood every 45 minutes,

190
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,353
how much wood will I need
to keep both of these beavers

191
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:27,830
well-fed all weekend long?

192
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:31,234
While you figure it out at home,

193
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:34,533
how about we sing you a song
about our beavers?

194
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:42,663
You don't get to hear the beaver song!
It is a sweet song about friendship,

195
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:45,624
and you guys are being disgusting,
and beavers are adorable!

196
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,125
No arguments here.

197
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,298
'Sup Shmosby!

198
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,635
Punchy, what are you doing here?

199
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,803
Yesterday you said
if I was ever in New York.

200
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,159
'Sup, turds?

201
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,768
Okay...
Where are you staying?

202
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,145
In your mom's pants.
Trick. She's old.

203
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:10,482
Don't worry about me.
I'm cool on the couch.

204
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,317
He's staying here?
You're staying here?

205
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,819
I know! It's so good, right?
Feel like you're dreaming?

206
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:17,461
But check your totem, brah.
Punchy's here in the flesh.

207
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,407
So, why don't we get
one of these, Ted?

208
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,173
Remember these?
High school? Junior high?

209
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:25,080
- Elementary school? Remember those?
- Look, look, Punchy's here.

210
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,849
Schmosby, remember when you dookied
in your pants down by the lake?

211
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,124
Unbelievable!

212
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,942
Schmosby, remember when
you dookied on our couch

213
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,099
in the form of your idiot
high school friend?

214
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,052
Unbelievable!

215
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,210
Come on. I worry about the guy.

216
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:48,311
He's had the same dead-end job
at a car rental place for 15 years.

217
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,435
- Don't care.
- He's been stuck in Cleveland

218
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,148
- his whole life.
- Get a hotel.

219
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,318
LeBron.

220
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:57,028
Okay, one night.

221
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,250
Gotta go.

222
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:03,159
- Where are you going? We just got here.
- A Korean massage.

223
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,582
- By yourself?
- Well, I figured you'd be busy,

224
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,039
reading <i>What to Expect
When You're Expecting to Expect.</i>

225
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,067
Guys, did you see that?

226
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,461
She's going
to a Korean massage without me.

227
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,047
That's our thing.

228
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,384
I'm telling you,

229
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,843
she's gonna dump me,
just like she dumped Glitter.

230
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,401
Lily, come on. We don't even
know that's what happened.

231
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:25,521
Hello, somebody already solved
that crime using math, remember?

232
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,272
Look, Lily.
Robin is clearly getting tired

233
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,228
of you constantly
talking about babies.

234
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:31,396
I don't.

235
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,691
- How old am I?
- 384 months.

236
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:35,859
Busted!

237
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:41,422
So before you Lily all over the place,
maybe you should

238
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,034
try hanging out with Robin
and not talking about babies.

239
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,744
<i>So Lily did just that.</i>

240
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,634
<i>She tried not to talk about babies.</i>

241
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,064
Lily, what brings you to the crib?

242
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:53,084
- Crib...
- What's the matter? You look rattled.

243
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:54,511
Rattled?

244
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,756
- I want to talk about babies.
- What?

245
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,341
Look, I know you don't
care about this stuff,

246
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,093
but I'm about to become a mother.

247
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,221
And as a future mother,
I'm gonna need the support...

248
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,474
Oh, my God!
You're not even pregnant yet.

249
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,059
What's that supposed to mean?

250
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,832
It means that a fertilized egg
has not yet attached itself

251
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:13,736
to the lining of your uterine wall.

252
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:15,992
You see?
I read your Facebook updates.

253
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:19,361
It's like it's all you ever
talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!

254
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,520
Well, guess what?
I've got some good news.

255
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,002
When that baby comes,
you don't have to see it. In fact,

256
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,490
you don't have to see me.

257
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:27,452
This whole friendship thing?
Done.

258
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,661
- Great.
- Great.

259
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,755
For crying out loud.
You broke up with Robin?

260
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:41,323
I had to.
We were growing apart, and,

261
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,385
we're better off without each other.

262
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:45,618
Lily, you sound about
as convincing as you did

263
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:48,640
the time you "accidentally" shredded
my Joey Buttafuoco pants.

264
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,189
Get on the phone, call Robin

265
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:57,159
- and fix this.
- I can't.

266
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,772
The damage is done.

267
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:01,327
Can you just hold me?

268
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:04,262
You know what? No.
I don't agree with what you did,

269
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:07,283
and so I refuse to comfort you,
despite how adorable you are

270
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:08,601
when you cry.

271
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,962
Okay. Maybe just one cuddle,
but then that is it.

272
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,460
Times Square's the bomb!

273
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:20,144
I got so many great pictures
of all the billboards.

274
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,533
You know, there's more to New York
than Times Square.

275
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:25,208
There's the Village,
the Lower East Side, Central Park...

276
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,030
They got better billboards
then the ones in Times Square?

277
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:31,099
Times Square's the bomb!

278
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,104
Here. You know what?
Hold this, okay?

279
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,728
I'm going to go pee in the jar
I got going in the alley.

280
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:41,443
Seriously, dude, he has got to go.

281
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,786
You need to be like,

282
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:46,156
"You are the weakest link.
Goodbye."

283
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,275
Punchy, the tribe has spoken.

284
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:51,870
Please pack up your knives and go.

285
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:54,344
Your work of art didn't work for us.

286
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:55,498
Your time's up.

287
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:57,905
I have to ask you
to leave the mansion.

288
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,136
You must leave the chateau.

289
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,812
Your tour ends here.

290
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,465
You've been chopped.

291
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:04,632
Yeah. I know.

292
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,890
You've been evicted
from the Big Brother house.

293
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:08,751
Your dessert just didn't measure up.

294
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,138
Sashay away.

295
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,866
Give me your jacket
and leave <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

296
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,690
I'm sorry, you did not get a rose.

297
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:16,659
You have been eliminated
from the race.

298
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:20,152
You are no longer in the running
to be America's Next Top Model.

299
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,304
You're fired.
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

300
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:25,195
Come look at this.

301
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,989
I found a little wounded
bird in the alley.

302
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,159
That's your scrotum.

303
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,870
You know what it is.

304
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,975
Come on, Ted.
You always fall for that.

305
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,209
Yeah, he's gotta go.

306
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,569
What are we doing
in Madison Square Garden?

307
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:51,281
You refused to talk to Robin so
I thought you might like to talk to...

308
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,306
the organist
for the New York Rangers.

309
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,019
Jessica Glitter?

310
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:17,036
- How did you find Glitter?
- Simple, really.

311
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:20,915
I used my powers of deduction.
I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist,

312
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,583
which is basically a piano, so

313
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:26,420
I made a list of all the keyboard-based
occupations and I cross-matched them...

314
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:29,840
His friend Barney looked me up,
hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.

315
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:31,419
Yo, Glitter...

316
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:32,785
be cool.

317
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:35,638
Is this the one who's best friend's
with Robin now?

318
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:39,115
More like ex-best friends.

319
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,440
Just like you.

320
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,618
I'm sorry to hear that.

321
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,100
I miss Robin.

322
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:48,943
Well, Marshall and I
are about to get pregnant,

323
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:53,573
and I know she stopped being friends
with you when you had a baby, so...

324
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:55,592
Robin didn't stop
being friends with me.

325
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,410
I stopped being friends with her.

326
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,036
What?
Why?

327
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:00,454
Because I had a baby.

328
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,966
Honey, when you have a baby,
all that best friend stuff...

329
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:07,191
hockey, bow hunting
for caribou, math,

330
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,005
that all goes out the window.

331
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:11,926
I tried to stay friends with her,
but it just didn't happen.

332
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,468
She took it pretty hard.

333
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,178
I even thought
she might try to kill herself.

334
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:19,807
Charge!

335
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,520
You dumped her
just because you had a baby?

336
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:24,645
That's cold.

337
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:26,821
Didn't you do the same thing?

338
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,232
Minus the baby?

339
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:32,820
I gotta go.
I gotta go apologize to Robin.

340
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:36,532
I need to tell her I love her,
and that she'll always be a priority.

341
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,285
Be careful, Lily.
I made those promises, too.

342
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:42,801
And now I haven't even
talked to her in five years.

343
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:45,381
Sure, I thought about

344
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,407
picking up the phone
and calling her a hundred times,

345
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:50,651
but I just never have
the courage to...

346
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,940
Go ahead.

347
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,813
Do you guys get Big Chuck
and Little John out here?

348
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:10,691
- Punchy, it's time to go back.
- Back to Times Square?

349
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,069
Back to Cleveland.

350
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:15,595
I don't know if I can do that, bro.

351
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:19,262
I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for
a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but,

352
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:21,365
I feel bad
about leaving you out here.

353
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,787
I worry about you, Ted.

354
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,164
You worry about me?

355
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,625
Yeah.
The other day when you called...

356
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,377
- Schmosby!
- Punchy!

357
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:31,161
- Good talking to you.
- You too.

358
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:33,317
- If you're ever in New York...
- Definitely.

359
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:39,387
- Sweetie, who was that?
- It was my friend Ted.

360
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:41,347
He sounded kind of depressed.

361
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:43,015
The Ted who got left at the altar?

362
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:46,442
He's not doing so good.

363
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,296
Poor guy lives
in a tiny apartment in New York,

364
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,087
nowhere near Times Square.

365
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:52,713
He's got no family around.

366
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,198
He's still single,
doesn't have a backyard.

367
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:56,654
It's just a bummer.

368
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:59,503
Maybe you should go visit him.
Cheer him up a little.

369
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,618
You know, buy him some shots,
do the whole wounded bird trick.

370
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:03,994
You think that'd work?

371
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:05,746
Worked on me.

372
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:11,877
She sounds pretty great, Punchy.

373
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:13,796
She's my angel.

374
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:17,466
In fact...
we're getting married.

375
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,346
That's...
I'm really happy for you.

376
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:24,014
Thanks, Ted. Thanks.

377
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,743
Actually, that's the other reason
why I came out here.

378
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,103
I wanted to see
if you'd be my best man.

379
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,107
Of course I will.

380
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:36,245
That's great!
No, you're stupid.

381
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,420
Dawg pound.

382
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:38,957
That's it...

383
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:43,096
<i>That night, Lily went to the one place
she knew she could find Robin,</i>

384
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,911
<i>New York's premiere Canadian bar,
the Hoser Hut.</i>

385
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:47,621
There you are.

386
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,124
Robin, I owe you a huge apology.

387
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:51,429
Me first.

388
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:54,567
I've been pulling away from you,
and I'm sorry. It's just...

389
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:56,630
The last time
my best friend had a baby...

390
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:58,637
I know.
I know all about it.

391
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,968
It's not gonna happen
with you and me.

392
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:05,340
And I'm sorry I've been crazy
with this baby stuff.

393
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,349
I know you hate babies.

394
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,215
Look, I hate most babies.

395
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:12,124
But your baby?

396
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,315
I'm gonna love that kid so much.

397
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,817
I'm gonna pick it up and everything.

398
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:21,702
I'm so happy you guys made up.

399
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,827
Me, too.

400
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,609
Where do I know this song from?

401
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,496
My God, it's the beaver song.
Which one of you put this on?

402
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:31,415
<i>Hey, beaver, come on</i>

403
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,835
<i>When you feel alone</i>

404
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:38,339
<i>Just pick up that phone</i>

405
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:43,903
<i>And I'll be there to share my</i>

406
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:46,878
<i>Ice cream cone</i>

407
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:51,154
<i>We'll lick it side by side</i>

408
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,621
- This is so dirty.
- Come on, Barney.

409
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:56,693
- It's a sweet song about friendship.
- Yeah, dude, come on.

410
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:58,991
<i>Day is done</i>

411
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,949
<i>Two beavers are better than one</i>

412
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:12,331
<i>Two beavers are better than one</i>

413
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,160
<i>They're twice the fun</i>

414
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:16,193
<i>Ask anyone</i>

415
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,057
<i>A second beaver can be</i>

416
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,929
<i>Second to none</i>

417
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:26,178
<i>Two beavers are better than one.</i>

418
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:32,522
<i>You're my favorite beaver...</i>

419
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:36,602
<i>Two beavers are better than one</i>

420
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,904
<i>Two beavers are better than one</i>

421
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:45,502
<i>They're twice the fun</i>

422
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:47,554

00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:51,122
<i>A second beaver can be</i>

424
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:54,574
