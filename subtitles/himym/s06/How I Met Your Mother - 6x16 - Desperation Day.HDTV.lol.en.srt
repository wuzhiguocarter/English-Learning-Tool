<i>NARRAT
My first kiss with Zoey was amazing,</i>

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:04,358
<i>and complicated.</i>

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:05,794
Look, um...

4
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:08,163
I know you're going
through a lot right now.

5
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:10,432
Getting divorced, being single,

6
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:13,134
figuring out
who you are on your own.

7
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:15,070
Someone knows how to set a mood.

8
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,272
I just mean...

9
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:19,774
I'm okay taking this slow.

10
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:21,843
I want to do this right.

11
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:25,313
<i>My friends, as usual,
were completely supportive.</i>

12
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:27,182
You're doing
this all wrong!

13
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,751
Ted, there are couples
in my kindergarten class

14
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,820
who have moved
faster than you two.

15
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,755
Granted, their home lives
are not great.

16
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:34,989
Hey, I'm trying.

17
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,858
I keep suggesting these
big, romantic dates,

18
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,777
and she keeps putting
on the brakes.

19
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:42,030
Like tonight, she wants me to
just come over and bake cookies.

20
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,031
Oh.

21
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,532
Translation: booty-call.

22
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,201
Total booty-call.

23
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:48,169
Private Booty,
reporting for duty.

24
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,704
That's crazy.

25
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:50,872
She-She wants to bake.

26
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:53,274
Guys booty-call girls
after 2:00 a.m.

27
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:56,511
with a drunkenly slurred,
"What ya doing?"

28
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:58,980
But when a lady
booty-calls a guy,

29
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,516
she invents
a respectable excuse

30
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:04,252
to mask the fact that she wants
to get stuck real good.

31
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:05,787
It's called class, Ted.

32
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:07,155
Wait. That...

33
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:09,591
You think that's what she
means by "baking cookies"?

34
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:10,809
Are you kidding?

35
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,728
You're in the kitchen,
it's getting hot,

36
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,397
you start licking stuff
off each others' fingers.

37
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:17,999
Before you know
it, she's bent

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,734
over the marble island,

39
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:21,769
and you're spanking her
with a rubber spatula.

40
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,605
And she's screaming,
"Stop, Marshall, stop,"

41
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:26,474
but that's just
code for "harder!"

42
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:28,543
Marshall's been
in Minnesota

43
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:29,644
a while, huh?

44
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:30,945
So long!

45
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:33,581
And now he's staying
even longer.

46
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:36,551
His mom has been having a really
hard time since the funeral.

47
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:38,319
He's waiting on her
hand and foot.

48
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,354
But...

49
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:40,355
it's Valentine's Day.

50
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:41,823
It's not going to be the same

51
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:43,758
<i>without the two of us
watching Predator together.</i>

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,026
<i>I should explain.</i>

53
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:46,928
<i>On their very first
Valentine's Day,</i>

54
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,231
<i>Marshall and Lily set out
to watch Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

55
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:54,169
You know, I saw this in
the theater, like, five times,

56
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,771
but I never got to see it
with the right girl.

57
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:58,173
Aw...

58
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:01,709
I'm so glad none of those
girls were right for you.

59
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,278
What girls?

60
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,780
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER:
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

61
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:09,918
<i>Except Marshall's brothers had
taped over it with Predator.</i>

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,085
Mmm.

63
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:13,454
<i>And it became a tradition.</i>

64
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:15,723
Wow, you sound
really lonely.

65
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:19,194
I am. Earlier today,
I burst into tears...

66
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,762
Shh. Daddy's
talking now.

67
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:23,531
Loneliness.
The looming specter

68
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:25,767
of Valentine's Day
fast approaching.

69
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:29,637
<i>The two key ingredients to my
favorite day of the year,</i>

70
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:33,007
February 13:
Desperation Day.

71
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,109
That's not a thing.
It's a thing.

72
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,061
Much like Valentine's
Day itself,

73
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:39,380
Desperation Day dates
back thousands of years.

74
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:41,199
<i>BARNEY:
Weddings were forbidden</i>

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,450
<i>under ancient Roman law,</i>

76
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,886
<i>so Saint Valentine
performed them in secret,</i>

77
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:46,854
<i>under threat of death.</i>

78
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:48,990
That's actually true.
Wait, there's more.

79
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,191
This won't be.

80
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:52,026
<i>And right by
Saint Valentine's side</i>

81
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:55,630
<i>was his best bro,
Saint Desperatius,</i>

82
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:58,233
<i>there to pick off
insecure bridesmaids.</i>

83
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,634
Whoa. Check
out that one.

84
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:02,303
Her body is
a perfect X.

85
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:06,107
Player, play on.
High V.

86
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:08,376
Oh, Jupiter,

87
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,929
what are your plans for me?

88
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,548
15 and still unmarried.

89
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:17,919
And I thought
Pompeii was smokin'.

90
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,073
Every woman wants a date
on Valentine's Day.

91
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:24,359
That neediness
reaches its climax--

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,828
what up-- on
February 13.

93
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,530
A magical night
when a ten

94
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,432
has the self-esteem
of a four

95
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,801
and the depraved
enthusiasm of a two.

96
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,771
Now, there's only one
thing you can't do.

97
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:38,439
Please say "widows."

98
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,743
Wherever you are, or
whoever you're under,

99
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:46,281
<i>you must get home
alone by 11:59 p.m.</i>

100
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:49,417
Otherwise, you're on a
date on Valentine's Day.

101
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:50,852
ROBIN:
Barney, Desperation Day

102
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,888
assumes that all single women
freak out about Valentine's Day.

103
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,490
Which we do not.

104
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,593
Case in point, I will be
spending February 13

105
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:00,395
with some lovely
single ladies from work...

106
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:02,480
Trolls.
...who could care less

107
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,399
about Valentine's Day.
Lying trolls.

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,600
And we will be celebrating
the fact that we don't have

109
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:08,102
to spend it
with some dippy guy

110
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:10,238
carting around roses
and stuffed toys all night.

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,339
Oh, no offense, Ted.

112
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,709
And none was taken
until just then.

115
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,724
I decided to
go to Minnesota

116
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:31,059
to see Marshall.

117
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,860
He shouldn't have
to help his mom

118
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,229
through this rough time
all by himself.

119
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,148
You losing your mind,
being alone in your apartment?

120
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,299
I'm getting weird!

121
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,468
<i>LILY:
See, it started off</i>

122
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:43,371
<i>with me throwing Marshall's
jersey on my body pillow.</i>

123
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:47,375
<i>And, well, things kind of
spiraled from there.</i>

124
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:51,746
I'm sorry
I yelled like that before.

125
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,183
I call him "Marshpillow."
And he calls me...

126
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:57,785
nothing because he's a pillow.

127
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:00,955
Hey.

128
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:03,157
Hey. How was "baking cookies"
last night?

129
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:04,826
<i>NARRATOR:
That was a tough question.</i>

130
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:06,427
<i>You see...</i>

131
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:08,129
Hi.

132
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,565
Uh...

133
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:13,067
Is that an overnight bag?

134
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:15,903
(Lily and Robin groan)

135
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:17,872
You brought an overnight bag?

136
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:19,807
You guys said I was definitely
going to spend the night.

137
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:20,942
We said you were
going to have sex.

138
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:22,710
We didn't say,
"Bring a carry-on."

139
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,679
So how did Zoey react?

140
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,315
She thought it was presumptuous
and asked me to leave.

141
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:29,717
It's-It's not like
I brought a ton of stuff.

142
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:31,419
Were there slippers
for the morning?

143
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:35,056
Not slippers, exactly.

144
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:36,324
(Lily, Robin and Barney
groaning)

145
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:38,793
They're called
British morning socks.

146
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,596
<i>JUDY:
This is such a nice surprise.</i>

147
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:44,382
Marshall will be so happy.

148
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:45,700
Oh...

149
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,336
How are you
holding up, Judy?

150
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:49,404
Oh, I'm doin' okay.

151
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:50,888
It gets a little lonely.

152
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,808
My friends suggested
a body pillow, but...

153
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,810
(chuckles)
I'm not a lunatic.

154
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,061
MARSHALL:
Hey, Mom?

155
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:58,713
I hate to be that guy,

156
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,648
but I'm pretty sure
it was Hot Pocket o'clock,

157
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,400
like, ten minutes ago.

158
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,952
Lily. Lily.
(video game sound effects)

159
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,070
What are you doing here?

160
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,822
I wanted to surprise you.

161
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:09,574
Oh, my gosh.
That's so sweet.

162
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,409
I'm so glad
you're here.

163
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,194
Hey, um, before
I forget, Mom,

164
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:14,862
did you remember to get
more double-A batteries?

165
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:15,963
Oh, they're upstairs,
sweetie.

166
00:06:15,964 --> 00:06:17,665
Right next to your washed
and folded clothes.

167
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,067
Oh, great, okay. I don't want
my Game Boy to crap out.

168
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm having the sickest
Dr. Mario run of my life.

169
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:23,571
Okay. I'll be
right back.

170
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:24,639
I love you, Lily.

171
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Okay.

172
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,791
You're the best, Mom.

173
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:30,128
Aw... Anything
for my baby bear.

174
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,947
Get him out of my house.

175
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,633
Take Marshall back
to New York with you.

176
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:40,700
Please, I am begging you.

177
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,469
I thought he was here
helping you.

178
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,637
Well, he was, at first.

179
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:44,871
But once he saw me starting

180
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,706
to do better,
he kind of regressed.

181
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,509
He's been holed up in his room
for days at a time,

182
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,844
playing old video games.

183
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:54,181
I mean, he is having a pretty
sick Dr. Mario run, but...

184
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,215
(sighs)

185
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:56,850
Uh, I'll talk to him.

186
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,318
I want to be
there for him,

187
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,887
but it's like
he's a teenager again.

188
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,490
I even walked in
on him abusing himself.

189
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:04,691
Oh, God.

190
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,859
There he was, on the bed,

191
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,327
looking at old photos
of his dad.

192
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:10,697
That's emotional self-abuse,
don't you think?

193
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,399
(knocking)

194
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,735
Hi.
Hi.

195
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,936
Listen,

196
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,322
that was a dumb move
for me to just assume...

197
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:20,540
No, no, I overreacted.

198
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,244
I mean, I invited you over
to "bake cookies."

199
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,879
We both knew what that meant.

200
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,846
We totally did.

201
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,248
I just, you know...

202
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,317
I saw those slippers
in your bag,

203
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,351
and suddenly everything

204
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,053
felt really serious.

205
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:36,056
And... ever since,
I've been asking myself,

206
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:38,925
"Am I ready for this?"

207
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,460
And...

208
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,897
the answer is "yes."

209
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:49,936
They're actually called
British morning socks.

210
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:50,937
Yeah. Don't get in your own way.

211
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,272
Right. Okay.

212
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:53,189
(video game sound effects)

213
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,325
Um, Marshall,
your mom asked me

214
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:56,543
to carry this up.

215
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,712
She turned her ankle
on your Hot Wheels.

216
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:00,213
Is my track okay?

217
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,782
It's fine, but, Marshall,

218
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,452
I thought you were here
taking care of your mom.

219
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,854
It seems like
she's taking care of you.

220
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,857
My mom loves to feel needed.

221
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,192
Letting her
take care of me

222
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:14,561
is how I'm taking care of her.

223
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:16,930
She's in a dark place, Lily.

224
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,598
She needs this.

225
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,000
Mom?

226
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,301
You forgot my
chocolate milk

227
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:22,836
with the swirly straw!

228
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,939
JUDY:
Oops. Comin' right up!

229
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,275
Ow. Ow.

230
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,609
(whispers):
She needs this.

231
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,345
Marshall,
tomorrow's Valentine's.

232
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,081
Don't you want to be
at home on our couch,

233
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,150
cuddling up under
a warm blanket,

234
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,486
watching the Predator
use his heat vision

235
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:42,205
to stalk helpless prey?

236
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:57,504
(makes Predator clicking noise)

237
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,906
<i>Well, baby, we could
watch Predator here.</i>

238
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,675
No, my mom can go
rent it for us

239
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:03,510
after she's done
digging out the car.

240
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,778
Marshall, your mom wants you
out of here.

241
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,812
What?

242
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,714
Anything else, sweetie?

243
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:10,483
Mom, d-do you want me to leave?

244
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,719
Heavens to Bess, no!

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,287
Of course not!

246
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,355
But, Judy, you said...

247
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,791
Oh, if Marshall could
stay here forever,

248
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,027
I would be the happiest
mom in Minnesota.

249
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,228
(chuckles)

250
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,264
(mouthing)

251
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:28,084
So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

252
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,453
Yeah. You know, there's
this new Italian restaurant

253
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,672
on 79th that's
supposed to be amazing.

254
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,508
I would be happier having
just a simple, home-cooked meal.

255
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,777
As long as it's with you.

256
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,180
Tomorrow night, my place.

257
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,819
I'm ready for this, Ted.

258
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,786
I am in it

259
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,304
for the long haul.

260
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:51,691
I can't wait for our first
Valentine's Day as a couple.

261
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,159
(laughs)

262
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,862
The one we'll remember
for years.

263
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,066
Isn't that great?
Yeah, if you say so, yeah.

264
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,167
What do you mean?

265
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,202
(sighs)

266
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:03,937
Look, she just got
out of a marriage, Ted.

267
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,205
That's heavy.

268
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:08,208
I'm kind of freaking out,
just listening to you.

269
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,376
My heart is pounding,

270
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:10,794
I'm hearing this weird
clicking noise.

271
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,996
(Predator clicking noise)

272
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,516
Well, it's romantic, right?

273
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:19,786
Zoey and I are getting serious
on Valentine's Day.

274
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,389
See, that just amps up
the pressure even more.

275
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,891
Boy, it's a good thing
that you're sure.

276
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,159
Who said I wasn't sure?

277
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,795
I'm glad we're
in a serious relationship.

278
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,296
Right away.

279
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,331
And if I screw this up,

280
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:32,599
I'm the devil,

281
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,100
because she's going
through a divorce.

282
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,985
But I'm not going
to screw this up.

283
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:38,438
So stop freaking out, Robin.

284
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,973
Stop freaking out!

285
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,876
<i>NARRATOR: Kids, I'm not super
proud of what I did next.</i>

286
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,160
Hi!

287
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:45,712
I'm here to help Marshall.

288
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,883
<i>Meanwhile, as Desperation Day</i>

289
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,651
<i>turned into
Desperation Night...</i>

290
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,422
God, these girls are so hungry
for male attention.

291
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:59,859
It is like being a hunter
and having the deer walk up,

292
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,928
tie itself to the hood
of your car

293
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,496
and beg to get mounted.

294
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,864
ROBIN:
Barney, this is

295
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:08,001
Bev and Anna, uh, my
coworkers and my friends.

296
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,137
Bev, Anna, this is Barney,
a high-functioning sociopath

297
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,039
and my ex.

298
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,274
<i>Enchanté.</i>

299
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,142
That's French for
"What's with the purple?"

300
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,477
Well, tomorrow is
Valentine's Day,

301
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,546
and everything is
pink and red, so Bev

302
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:20,880
very thoughtfully
suggested

303
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,883
that we wear purple to
show how little we care.

304
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,952
I use, uh, colors
to express emotion.

305
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,454
Purple is for pride.

306
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,589
It was a stupid idea.

307
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,524
Bev, you look at me.

308
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,827
<i>It's not a stupid idea.</i>

309
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,728
Tonight, we are queens.

310
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:38,364
And we don't care
about some stupid,

311
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,233
sexist, corporate
holiday.

312
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:41,885
Please!

313
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:45,805
You might as well be dog-earing
a tear-stained bridal magazine

314
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,774
while wolfing down
the box of chocolates

315
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,542
you had delivered
to yourself at work

316
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,644
from your "fiancé"
who no one's ever met.

317
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,680
Gerard is real!

318
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,748
Oh!

319
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:56,816
(video game sound effects)

320
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,186
Ted... I thought
you were going

321
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,956
to talk to Marshall about
coming back to New York.

322
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:06,459
Yeah, but, you know,
things move so fast in New York.

323
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,263
Why not hang out here until
at least after Valentine's Day?

324
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,265
Plus, we're helping
Marshall's mom.

325
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,417
Uh, Mrs. Eriksen,
we're running low on SunnyD!

326
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:16,503
JUDY:
Is orange juice okay?

327
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,805
BOTH:
No!

328
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,409
Okay, when your "fiancé"
Gerard comes back

329
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,345
from fixing cleft palates
in Peru,

330
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:28,014
maybe snatch a photo
of the two of you together,

331
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,549
and then I'll totally
believe you.

332
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,686
Well, he's going to
Kenya after Peru, so...

333
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,488
Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.

334
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,423
Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh,
Nora, this is Barney.

335
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,226
You want to see Anna beat
him in an arm wrestle?

336
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,861
My elbow slipped!

337
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:45,965
Marshall, I'm going home.

338
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,937
What?

339
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,907
I'm flying out tonight
before the big storm,

340
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:56,175
and I want you to come with me.

341
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:00,680
I can't right now,
'cause my mom needs me.

342
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:03,349
While I'm sure
it's been really helpful

343
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,751
for her to have you here

344
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:07,954
<i>playing Super Mario Kart
for 14 hours a day...</i>

345
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,255
<i>You have Super Mario Kart?!</i>

346
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,524
Hell, yeah.

347
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,660
But your mom doesn't need you.

348
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:15,562
Your life in New York needs you.

349
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:18,765
It needs you really bad.

350
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,601
Baby, don't go.

351
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,159
Please come home soon.

352
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:36,082
So, you were an Olympic gymnast?

353
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,083
Silver medal.

354
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,284
Ooh, sorry.

355
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,486
Gold's the only thing
that really counts.

356
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,921
That's what my dad said.

357
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,523
And she sticks the landing.

358
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:46,292
Why don't you start
stretching, and I'll...

359
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,461
be right back.

360
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,762
Hey, hey, sorry.
Oh, hi.

361
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,130
Quick question.
Yeah.

362
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,465
Why aren't you wearing purple
like your friends?

363
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,968
Oh, I told them I forgot,
but the truth is,

364
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,703
I'm kind of protesting
their protest.

365
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,404
Can you keep a secret?

366
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,238
Sure.

367
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,140
I love Valentine's Day.

368
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,309
Oh, my gosh! Me, too!

369
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,979
Um, is it getting crowded
in here, 'cause I think

370
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,413
there are two peas in this pod?

371
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,215
Oh, you're a gooey romantic,
too?

372
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,684
Guilty. This is
embarrassing,

373
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,088
but every year, I buy flowers
and a box of chocolates,

374
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,290
even if I'm not with someone.

375
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,692
Just in case, you know?

376
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,894
We are pitiful.
The worst.

377
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,129
(both chuckle)

378
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,897
Although there is one difference
between you and me.

379
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,100
What's that? I'm not
saying any of this

380
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,218
to get in your pants.

381
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,806
(video game sound effects)

382
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,410
I miss my dad, Ted.

383
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,647
I miss him so much.

384
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,148
I know.

385
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,384
Um, when I was a kid,

386
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,737
we would spend the summers
in the Upper Peninsula.

387
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:50,356
And every year,
we wouldn't get to the cabin

388
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,558
till, like,
the middle of the night.

389
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,227
And so, it would be pitch black,

390
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,195
<i>in the middle of the woods.</i>

391
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,798
<i>And I could never see anything
in front of the headlights,</i>

392
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,169
<i>but I always felt so safe
'cause my dad was driving.</i>

393
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,638
<i>He was like
some sort of superhero</i>

394
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,107
<i>who could just see way out
into the darkness.</i>

395
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,844
Now he's just gone.

396
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,048
And it's pitch black.

397
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,317
And I can't see where I'm going.

398
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,520
I can't see anything.

399
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:24,524
All right, okay.

400
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,925
I was playing you before.

401
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,394
But I was really doing you
a public service.

402
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,296
It's February 13--

403
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,666
a day many are now calling
Desperation Day.

404
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,068
It's kind of a thing.

405
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,371
And you walking around,
saying you're a gooey romantic?

406
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,240
It comes across a bit desperate.

407
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,777
What's desperate about
knowing what you want?

408
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,679
Look, life is
really short, Barney.

409
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,715
Who wants to spend
Valentine's Day alone,

410
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,383
distracting yourself
from the fact

411
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,886
that nobody loves you
with some sad little activity?

412
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,622
Um, or you could be
in the 47th Semi-Annual

413
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,659
Laser Tag Tournament
in Poughkeepsie.

414
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,628
I have no idea what any
of those words mean.

415
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,198
Hey, I'm all stretched out!

416
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,802
Here's the first thing you need
to know about laser tag.

417
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,938
Thanks a lot
for coming out here, man.

418
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,406
Yeah.

419
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,609
Hey, are-are you sure
it's okay with Zoey

420
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,644
that you're here
for Valentine's Day?

421
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,914
Well, I mean, technically,
she doesn't know yet.

422
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:22,749
What?

423
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,083
Things with Zoey

424
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,785
are moving really fast,

425
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,454
and the divorce just makes
everything more complicated.

426
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,990
I just, I needed
to take a step back.

427
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,558
You're not taking a step back.

428
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,060
You're running away.

429
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,328
And hiding out here,

430
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,930
hiding out here is not gonna
solve anything.

431
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:38,898
You're just

432
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,366
holed up in Minnesota

433
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,536
because you're too scared
to face reality, and it's...

434
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:49,909
We got to go back
to New York, tonight.

435
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,111
We're snowed in.
Lily got the last flight.

436
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,147
So, we drive. It's time.

437
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,449
It's time to get back
to real life.

438
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,152
It's time to grow up.

439
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:00,319
Yeah.

440
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,587
Mom!

441
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,457
Can you make us some
PB and J's for the road?

442
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,758
Crusts cut off.

443
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,827
Crusts cut off!

444
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,529
No, Ted. What are we...?

445
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,533
We're men.

446
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,769
Mom!

447
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,939
Leave the crusts on!

448
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,582
They forced their opponents
to scatter, picking them off,

449
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,402
one by one, in a swift
and merciless slaughter.

450
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,472
became the 2010
Tri-County Champions.

451
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:37,342
Wow. Laser tag
sounds brilliant!

452
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:38,593
Oh, it is.

453
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:40,495
Plus, if you win,
you get free pizza!

454
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:43,198
This is my teammate
for tomorrow.

455
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,966
Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.

456
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,901
Where are Bev and Anna?

457
00:17:46,902 --> 00:17:47,769
Well...

458
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,337
So, we're taking off.

459
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:50,372
What?

460
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:51,573
Those guys are gonna

461
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:53,408
buy us hot dogs
at Grey's Papaya.

462
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,243
ROBIN:
What...? So that's it?

463
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:59,247
A couple of white Urkels offer
you sausages, and you're gone?

464
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,182
What about the sisterhood?

465
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:03,151
Solidarity? The color purple?

466
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:05,687
But tomorrow's
Valentine's Day.

467
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,322
I thought we didn't care
about Valentine's Day.

468
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,624
Look, Robin, you'll
find someone, too.

469
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,059
You're a queen.

470
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,594
You've got so
much to offer.

471
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,496
Maybe do something
with that hair.

472
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,265
I'm telling you.

473
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,600
The power of Valentine's Day.

474
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:22,404
I'm Huey Lewis,
and you just heard the news.

475
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:24,773
Well, I think
I'm heading out, too.

476
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:27,192
What? No, don't go!
You want to see a magic trick?!

477
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,510
It's late, and I have a date
with my pillow.

478
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,679
I mean, not literally.
I'm not a lunatic.

479
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:33,615
Boy Scout Troop 15

480
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:34,849
doesn't stand a chance.

481
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,751
Bye.

482
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:38,453
Mm.

483
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:45,627
Speaking of the power
of Valentine's Day...

484
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,295
What are you talking about?

485
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:48,563
Oh, come on.

486
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:49,964
It's-It's past midnight.

487
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,467
Desperation Day
has come and gone,

488
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:55,670
and you have neither gone
nor come.

489
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:58,173
You know why?

490
00:18:58,174 --> 00:18:59,307
You like Nora.

491
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:00,542
No, I don't. She's gross.

492
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:02,610
<i>Oh...
You like her.</i>

493
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:05,113
You think she smells like rain.

494
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:06,948
Whatever you say.

495
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:08,266
Oh, hey, Nora.

496
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:09,734
Nora...

497
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,728
MARVIN:
Here's a secret.

498
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,632
I couldn't see
worth a damn, either, buddy.

499
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:28,770
I just kept driving forward,
hoping for the best.

500
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,624
Look out!
(gasps)

501
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,942
Gotcha.

502
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:36,094
(laughs)

503
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:44,285
<i>NARRATOR: And so we
drove through the night,</i>

504
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:46,554
<i>out of Desperation Day
and into Valentine's.</i>

505
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:49,290
<i>And there was no trace of
my little freak out, except...</i>

506
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,193
Really? An overnight bag
for your own living room?

507
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,831
Looks like we got
a matching set.

508
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:59,767

presumptuous.

Those Boy Scouts have grown
a foot since last year.

513
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:10,211
They're terrifying!

514
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,613
Oh, yeah.

515
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,181
Change of plans.
