1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,083
<i>Kids, in the spring of 2011,
Zoey and I broke up.</i>

2
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:06,380
<i>But the good news...</i>

3
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:09,493
<i>Goliath National Bank was finally ready
to demolish The Arcadian</i>

4
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:12,066
<i>and build the new headquarters
I'd designed for them.</i>

5
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:16,261
<i>The only problem was
I kept butting heads</i>

6
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:19,310
<i>with my project supervisor
on one very important issue.</i>

7
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,437
I want to press the button
to blow up The Arcadian!

8
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:23,147
- I want to press it!
- No, I want!

9
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:24,693
I want to press it!

10
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:27,639
I dated you both and neither of you
is good at pressing

11
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:29,612
or even finding the button.

12
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,773
After some awkward pawing around,
that building

13
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,487
is going to fake an implosion,
say, "Baby, that was great",

14
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:35,743
and go to sleep.

15
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:38,412
She means you.

16
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:40,479
I want to press it.

17
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:41,916
I'm gonna press it!

18
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:43,522
It's just a button, okay?

19
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:45,905
Can we just talk
about something else, please?

20
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:49,340
I ran into Zoey yesterday.

21
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,701
That's the first time
since the breakup.

22
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:53,886
How's she doing?

23
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,598
I'm still unemployed,
so I had to get a couple roommates.

24
00:00:58,217 --> 00:00:59,367
Saving money.

25
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:01,731
Making new friends.
No downside.

26
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:03,771
They're all 22 and sell drugs.

27
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:05,816
Which means they're not taking them.

28
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,088
So, that's a win.

29
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:12,655
I can tell you're really busy
so I should...

30
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:14,121
I'll let you go.

31
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,405
You want to get coffee sometime?

32
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:20,121
You know "coffee" is code
for "I want to get back together"?

33
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:23,874
At first I wasn't sure, but then,
she said something that got me thinking.

34
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,161
I want to get back together.

35
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:27,909
Don't worry, we're not.

36
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,589
I just, I feel bad Zoey's
having such a hard time.

37
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:34,552
You know what might
make you feel better, buddy?

38
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,138
- I'm not letting you press the button.
- I want to press it!

39
00:01:38,085 --> 00:01:40,391
<i>Sadly, that's all you need
to know about my summer.</i>

40
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,395
<i>Around this time, Uncle Marshall was
still having a tough time finding a job.</i>

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,814
He's out printing out a whole
new batch of résumés

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,483
because he misspelled the phrase
"detail-oriented."

43
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,507
And when he gets back home,

44
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:54,196
he is going to find his favorite soup
there waiting for him.

45
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:55,708
That's sweet, Lily,

46
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,284
but didn't you guys get
food poisoning here one time?

47
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:00,489
Three times.

48
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:02,318
But they're really nice about it.

49
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:05,791
Their policy is,
"Get sick, get a free gallon of soup".

50
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,341
<i>And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's
surprise soup and headed back to work</i>

51
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,094
<i>to introduce the new class pet.</i>

52
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,013
This is Mr. Buttons 2.

53
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,131
Now, after what happened
to Mr. Buttons 1,

54
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:24,804
we have to be very gentle with...

55
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:10,708
Don't eat the soup!

56
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,661
Thank God.

57
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:18,364
This was about to be my third bowl.

58
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:21,659
Why shouldn't I eat the soup?

59
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:29,941
Why shouldn't I eat the soup?

Mr. Architect,
big day for you tomorrow, huh?

66
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,939
Yeah, getting to stand next to me
while I press the button.

67
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,553
That is going to be legend...
wait for it...

68
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:54,478
dary adjacent.

69
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,753
Legendary adjacent!

70
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:58,679
You okay?

71
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,784
This morning I was talking
to the foreman.

72
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,716
Hey, hotshot.

73
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,831
You know, Rod,
I'm loving that nickname,

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,500
and I can tell
it's totally affectionate,

75
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,961
but I'd prefer Ted.

76
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:17,035
Yeah, but you're such a hotshot,

77
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,174
I figured I'd just call you hotshot.

78
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:21,208
Pick one.

79
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,841
And make sure you like it.

80
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:24,729
There's going to be 50,000 of these

81
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:27,725
in your big, hotshot building,
hotshot.

82
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:31,145
50,000 lightbulbs!

83
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,730
What if this one's too bright?

84
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:36,113
What if this one flickers
and gives everyone a weird headache?

85
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:39,862
Do you know how many people
it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?

86
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:43,073
Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes?
What are we dealing with here?

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,337
There's so many decisions to be made.

88
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:48,204
What if I make all the wrong ones
and my building just sucks?

89
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,424
Not possible.
Your building is new.

90
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:51,877
And I have one rule.

91
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:54,627
New is always better.

92
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:57,338
You can't keep saying you have one rule
if they're always different.

93
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:00,612
But "new is always better"
is my oldest rule,

94
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:02,134
which makes it the best.

95
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:07,514
Everything okay?

96
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:10,267
Lily got food poisoning
from some soup.

97
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,896
And then I ate the soup,
exactly three hours later.

98
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:18,196
Which means I can see exactly
three hours into my future,

99
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,352
and it doesn't...

100
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,478
look...

101
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:24,122
good.

102
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,391
<i>I tried to be supportive.</i>

103
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:29,016
Oh, baby,
can you just hold me, please?

104
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,533
Of course, baby.

105
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,015
<i>But when Lily gets going</i>

106
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,713
<i>she sounds like a velociraptor
from Jurassic Park.</i>

107
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,324
<i>But then I realized...</i>

108
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,760
<i>a man can do a lot of living
in three hours.</i>

109
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:54,728
So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful,
crazy dance called life.

110
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:59,233
My last meal.
MacClaren's famous jalapeño poppers.

111
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,478
My doctor says
I need to eat healthier,

112
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,291
so I figured the round-trip flight
these babies are about to take

113
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,865
will land them permanently
on the no-fry list.

114
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:09,738
Good-bye, my friend.

115
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,597
It's been a hell of a ride.

116
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,808
I have to...

117
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:21,733
Hey, babe.

118
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,623
The gang says feel better.

119
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:25,573
Thanks.

120
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,510
Wait!

121
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:29,513
You didn't tell them
I had food poisoning, did you?

122
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:34,874
Marshall, when it's stomach stuff,
you just say "under the weather",

123
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:37,896
or people start picturing you
doing unspeakable things.

124
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:38,970
I know.

125
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,734
I just said
that you had the sniffles.

126
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,081
No one is picturing anything

127
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:46,113
but little red-nosed you

128
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,449
under a blankie with some hot tea.

129
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:51,285
I wonder what end
it's coming out of Lily right now.

130
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,203
I bet it's her tushie.

131
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,870
I bet it's both.

132
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:01,684
Speaking of explosions...

133
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,131
Enough already, Ted!
That button's mine!

134
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,758
Yeah, fine, okay.

135
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:08,385
I got you this job, so I...
Say what?

136
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:09,678
Whatever.

137
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:11,167
It's yours.

138
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,392
I gotta run.

139
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,606
Yes.

140
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:24,568
It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates.
They want me to come interview.

141
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,756
I know it's risky to go,

142
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,742
but this is the best environmental
law firm in New York, my dream job.

143
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:36,206
Great idea, babe.
I'll ask them.

144
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:40,584
Is it at all possible,
could I come in on Monday?

145
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:44,826
Okay, I'll, I'll see you at 5:00.
Thank you.

146
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,329
I love and believe in you too, baby.

147
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:54,890
Why would Ted

148
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,683
just give up the button like that?

149
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,325
He forgot his phone.

150
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,815
"See you in an hour."

151
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,790
- Who's that from?
- Zoey.

152
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:06,622
They're meeting for coffee.

153
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:09,892
Ted's getting back together with her!

154
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,829
Why would Ted get back together
with Zoey? He's doing great.

155
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:19,997
After a breakup,
we all think we're doing great.

156
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,157
Sometimes the tiniest trigger
can unravel you

157
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:24,844
and send you crawling right back.

158
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,548
Ted isn't getting back with Zoey
because of lightbulbs.

159
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,341
Ted's gone back for less.

160
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,001
Hi, Natalie.

161
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,150
You want to get coffee sometime?

162
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:39,808
CARTON

163
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:43,229
Bro.

164
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:45,940
Ted, I only have one rule.

165
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:48,734
But I can't reach the worst part.

166
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,166
Hi, Karen.

167
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,937
Want to get coffee sometime?

168
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:54,729
CARTON

169
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,172
<i>Coming up next, our two local pandas,</i>

170
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,866
<i>Ming Ming and Bao Bao,
are expecting a baby.</i>

171
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:03,195
You want to get coffee sometime...?

172
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:04,767
Get it together, bro.

173
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,617
According to my calculations,
at 6:00 PM,

174
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:10,946
my body is gonna pay out

175
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:13,453
like the most disgusting
slot machine in the world.

176
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:15,916
That gives me two hours
to go do the interview

177
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,346
and still get back in time.

178
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,807
What if you hit the jackpot early?

179
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:21,697
Don't worry.

180
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:23,837
I'll be prepared.

181
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,271
I'm talking your ear off, sorry.

182
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,625
Is there anything
I can do for you, sweetie?

183
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:50,418
Can... I... borrow...

184
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:53,382
an adult diaper?

185
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,553
Let's stop Ted.
Where are they meeting?

186
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:00,833
Zoey wrote, "Meet me
at 6:00, where it all began,

187
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,100
where you gave me the orchid
at the intersection."

188
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,290
That's good.
All we have to do is think back

189
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:07,521
to the time Ted told us
about his first date with Zoey.

190
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:09,825
Amazing first date with Zoey!

191
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,237
We met at the intersection.

192
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,572
That's sweet.

193
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,491
You weren't listening either?

194
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:19,788
I was in a coma.

195
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:22,495
I mean, who pays attention
to that sappy romantic crap?

196
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,874
Yeah, I wasn't listening, either.

197
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,544
Ted really can go on about a bitch.

198
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:30,984
Great.

199
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:33,381
He could be anywhere.
We're flat out of clues.

200
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,154
Wait. Ted left a message.

201
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,506
I could hear it
'cause I was in the bathroom...

202
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,554
blowing my nose.
I have the sniffles.

203
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:43,544
<i>Hey, Lily,
hope you're feeling better.</i>

204
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:46,394
<i>Marshall told us you're exploding from
both ends like a busted fire hydrant.</i>

205
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:48,666
Damn it.

206
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,375
<i>Anyway, listen, I was going
to get back together with Zoey today,</i>

207
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,652
<i>but I came to my senses
on the way out here, so...</i>

208
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:56,028
<i>False alarm.</i>

209
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:58,364
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

210
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:00,229
<i>Just stepped in some gum.</i>

211
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,618
<i>I'm getting back together with Zoey!</i>

212
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,704
We're never gonna find him.

213
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,871
Wait.

214
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,624
That's was a subway announcement
in the background.

215
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,875
I speak conductor.

216
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,335


217
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,088
Got it.
Ted's at...

218
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:27,059
- Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street.
- That's the intersection.

219
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:29,603
That's in Brooklyn. How are we
ever gonna get there in time?

220
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:30,980
Way ahead of ya.

221
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,584
Jake Bloom. Great to meet you.

222
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:43,284
I'm sorry about the stench.

223
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,507
We're suing a factory
that's been dumping raw sewage

224
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:46,704
into a marshland.

225
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,289
Ten minutes ago,

226
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,584
I was knee-deep
in liquefied human feces.

227
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:54,189
And that was just on the F train.

228
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:59,119
I can't believe Ted's getting
back together with Zoey.

229
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:02,136
- They're a total train wreck.
- Unmitigated disaster.

230
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:03,684
Worst couple ever.

231
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:06,698
Yeah, almost as bad as us.

232
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:09,782
We were a mess.

233
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,646
Do you remember how awful
I looked by the end?

234
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,649
My hair was falling out,

235
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:17,193
my skin was gray,
my back was hunched.

236
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:19,726
What about me?
I got so fat,

237
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:22,198
at the end of a date,
you'd unhook my bra.

238
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,493
You were the only boyfriend
I ever motorboated.

239
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,080
Thank God we're not sentimental saps
who panic and get back together.

240
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,166
Seriously,

241
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,001
why would people do that?

242
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,067
I guess I get it.

243
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,715
What do you mean?

244
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,231
Well, no matter how bad things got...

245
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,481
Ted really did love Zoey
for a minute there.

246
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:49,172
Didn't he?

247
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:56,440
He did.

248
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:01,816
She loved him, too.

249
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:04,532
Didn't she?

250
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,495
Yeah, she did.

251
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:16,460
Smith and Ninth Street.

252
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,558
Let me show you some of the
gut-wrenching environmental atrocities

253
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,933
that we were working to stop, okay?

254
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:27,134
Here, pop quiz.

255
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:29,390
What is that?

256
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:31,267
That's a seal.

257
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:36,188
A bloated seal corpse
rotting in industrial waste.

258
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,756
Now, wait till you see what we found

259
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,485
when we cut him open.

260
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:46,075
- Okay, where the hell are they?
- Maybe this isn't the intersection.

261
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,776
Maybe it is and we're too late. Man,
I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.

262
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,537
I know, right?

263
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,720
Ever since the Trader Joe's
opened up,

264
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,916
Brooklyn is so... whatever.

265
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,419
Wait. Where'd you get that?

266
00:13:58,585 --> 00:13:59,712
Across the street

267
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,378
at the Intersection.

268
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,304
So...

269
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:06,358
You guys...

270
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,013
wanna buy some weed or...?

271
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:21,743
She's alone! There's still time!
But where the hell is Ted?

272
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:25,033
Wait a minute. On their first date,
he brought her an orchid.

273
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:28,155
How much do you want to bet
he's gonna do it again?

274
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:31,241
Brilliant. But wait,
he had a huge head start on us.

275
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,828
No way he's still in there unless
he spent an hour choosing an orchid.

276
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:35,913
Thanks, Julia!

277
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,799
You know what?

278
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:43,003
Let me see
the pink lady slipper again.

279
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,049
Now, do you know what that is?

280
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,015
A pile of rotting seagull carcasses

281
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,430
covered in toxic sludge.

282
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:55,777
Being eaten by rats. Exactly.

283
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,116
Now this next slide...

284
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:01,674
I'm sorry.
That's my wife's water birth.

285
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,049
I don't know how that got in there.

286
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:09,363
Anyway, that's all my questions.

287
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,193
<i>Oh, my God, I made it!</i>

288
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:13,732
<i>Now just shake his hand,</i>

289
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:15,911
<i>clench your very soul
and run like hell!</i>

290
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,333
I like to take 20 minutes at the end
of every interview for your questions.

291
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:23,292
So don't hold back.

292
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,879
Whatever you got inside there,
you just let her rip.

293
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:29,395
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

294
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,218
<i>I'm just gonna tell him the truth.</i>

295
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,712
When it's stomach stuff,
you just say "Under the weather"

296
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:39,137
or people start picturing you
doing unspeakable things.

297
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:42,948
I have food poisoning
and I'm about to start volcanoing

298
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:44,932
toxic sludge out of both ends!

299
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,066
Nailed it.

300
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,130
Thanks, Julia!

301
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,476
No, on second thought.

302
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,413
- Come on.
- What the hell?!

303
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,124
You can't get back with Zoey
over a lightbulb.

304
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,293
I'm not freaking out
over a lightbulb!

305
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,009
I'm freaking out over
50,000 lightbulbs!

306
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:08,609
I can't do this!

307
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:11,425
I only got this job because
you gave it to me, Barney.

308
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,941
I didn't earn it!

309
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,391
The future is scary.

310
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:21,226
But you can't just run back to the past
because it's familiar.

311
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,052
Yes, it's tempting.

312
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:26,707
But...

313
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:28,801
It's a mistake.

314
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:33,381
You're right.

315
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,562
Excuse me.

316
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:39,953
Can you give this to the blonde
sitting alone in there

317
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:42,914
and tell her Ted's really sorry?

318
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,208
Also...

319
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,713
Indirect sunlight. Don't overwater.
Half a cup a week is more than enough.

320
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,071
<i>And kids...</i>

321
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:12,391
<i>that's how I met your mother.</i>

322
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,350
<i>Psych. It was just some chick.</i>

323
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,078
Hey, baby, how'd it go?

324
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:22,544
Lily, this year,

325
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:25,793
this nasty schoolyard bully of a year

326
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,918
will not stop punching me
in the face.

327
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,565
How did we kick off 2011?

328
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,005
My dad died.

329
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:34,522
And now after five months
of unemployment,

330
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:35,968
I just blew my dream job.

331
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:39,342
The good news is, in a few seconds,
I'm gonna start heaving my guts out

332
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,542
because that's what life is
for me now,

333
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,685
just losing what's inside
until I'm just empty.

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,186
Baby, come here.

335
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,524
I just want to shut my eyes
for a few seconds before it starts.

336
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:03,113
<i>And Marshall slept...</i>

337
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:07,999
<i>... all night.</i>

338
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,225
Who's gonna do the honors?

339
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:27,436
He is.

340
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,812
You sure?

341
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:31,314
You earned it.

342
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,167
All clear!

343
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,241
New is always better, right?

344
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,493
Always.

345
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:46,370
Ten,

346
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,415
nine, eight...

347
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:52,562
It's a miracle.
I didn't get sick.

348
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:54,296
I didn't get sick.

349
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:56,068
I know, baby.

350
00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:59,137
I'm pregnant.

351
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,421
I'm proud of you
for giving Ted the button.

352
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:38,457
It meant a lot.

353
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:39,886
It's just a button.

354
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,611
Can we talk about
something else, please?

355
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:51,895
How you been?

356
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:53,438
Fine.

357
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:00,136
I don't know why you would possibly
say yes to this, but,

358
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,989
would you want to grab
a cup of coffee with me sometime?

359
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,457
20 minutes.
I was such a jerk to you.

360
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,454
You can spend the entire time calling
me every dirty name in the book.

361
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:13,124
I speak four languages.
I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.

362
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:16,231
I'll call you.

363
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:18,630
You look beautiful, by the way.

364
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,299
And here I thought
it was too late for sundresses.

365
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:23,426
It's never too late, Barney.

366
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:27,968
Challenge accepted.

367
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:44,531
Best man?
You're being summoned.

368
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,241
Geez, what now?

369
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:51,872
I heard the groom needed me.

370
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:57,586
What do you think of this tie?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
