<i>TED: Kids, when your best friend
loses someone...</i>

4
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:18,562
My dad's dead?

5
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:21,198
<i>...you drop everything
and rush to his side.</i>

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,234
<i>only to find yourself
standing there</i>

7
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,603
with no idea what to do or say.

8
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:27,805
This is the toughest time
in Marshall's life

9
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,540
and I feel
absolutely useless.

10
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,509
What can we do
to help?

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,643
Don't look at me.

12
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:34,478
This morning Marshall said,
"I have to pee."

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,864
And I, "Don't worry, baby,
I'll do it for you."

14
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:37,982
Halfway through the pee,

15
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,683
I'm, like, "This doesn't
even make sense!"

16
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:41,652
Well, uh, I've been
to a couple funerals,

17
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:44,288
so I know my role:
I'm Vice Girl.

18
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,190
Whatever Marshall needs
to get through this day,

19
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:47,558
I got it right here.

20
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,828
ALL:
Whoa!

21
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,663
Cigarettes, alcohol...

22
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:53,964
Are these firecrackers?

23
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:56,333
My God, Robin,
you somehow crammed

24
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:59,437
Tijuana into a purse.

25
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:02,356
(hushed):
Be cool, nerds!

26
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,644
Marshall's mom hasn't eaten,
slept or sat down

27
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:08,028
since we got here.

28
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:10,498
Wait! That can be my role!

29
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:12,349
I'll take care of Judy!

30
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,084
Yeah, but doesn't
Marshall's mom hate you--

31
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:15,870
the fact that you two
aren't very close?

32
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,288
(whispering):
Sweet save.

33
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:20,124
Okay, yes,
Judy and I aren't besties,

34
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,326
but today, whatever she needs,
I'm there.

35
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:23,527
I'm on Judy duty.

36
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:25,196
"Judy duty."

37
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:26,380
She said "doody."

38
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:28,466
Really, guys?
At a funeral?

39
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:31,569
Uh, okay, while not all
of us possess

40
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,504
your lofty sense
of decorum,

41
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:34,538
Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-
After-School-Special,

42
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,773
we have to laugh today.

43
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:37,775
It's healthy.
Wait a minute!

44
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:41,178
Today, we are gonna make
Marshall laugh.

45
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:42,079
How?

46
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,881
Ted, what's the one thing that

47
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:45,049
always cracks him up?

48
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,717
Internet footage of a guy
getting hit in the nuts.

49
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,085
Internet footage of a guy

50
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,737
getting hit in the nuts,
exactly!

51
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:52,556
So we are gonna get our bro
a four-star nad rattler.

52
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,441
You search knees, feet,
banisters,

53
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,659
fire hydrants and diving boards,

54
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,862
and I'll cover bats, rackets,
hockey sticks,

55
00:01:57,863 --> 00:01:59,280
golf clubs and riding crops.

56
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,230
What about animals?

57
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:02,533
Uh... Claws,
paws, talons,

58
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:04,535
hooves, beaks and
clenched monkey fists.

59
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,036
We can do this!

60
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:07,838
Hey, guys, sorry, uh...
I left my charger back

61
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:09,607
in New York, so my phone's
out of juice.

62
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:10,574
Does anyone have...?

63
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:11,842
Outlet or USB?

64
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,344
Uh, outlet.

65
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:14,378
Thank you.

66
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:16,547
Oh...

67
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:19,683
Wow, you really do have
everything in there, don't you?

68
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:21,519
You're like Mary Poppins,
if her magic purse was

69
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,620
also filled with drugs.

70
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,956
"If"? Ted, the kids
in that movie jumped

71
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:29,593
into a painting and spent 15
minutes chasing a cartoon fox.

72
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,762
"Spoonful of sugar..."?

73
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:33,330
Grow up.

74
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Judy.

75
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:41,739
Thank you, Reverend.

76
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,674
Unfortunately, I can't.

77
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:46,977
My daughter in Chicago
just went into labor.

78
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:50,281
But I'm leaving you in
the capable hands

79
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:52,249
of my second-in-command: my son.

80
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,017
Your son?

81
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:55,653
Oh, you remember Trey.

82
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:57,287
I'll go grab him.

83
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:00,925
Guys...

84
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:04,061
Trey Platt terrorized me
growing up.

85
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:06,030
He was, he was the toughest
bully in school.

86
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:07,131
'Sup Marshall.

87
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:10,434
Hello, Trey.

88
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,369
Long time.
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,971
I was not aware

90
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:15,606
that you had
become a reverend.

91
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,509
Yeah, well, your lunch money
finally ran out.

92
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,210
Kidding!

93
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:23,981
Marshall Eriksen,
you could use a laugh.

94
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:25,816
Yeah!

95
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:28,485
This video is entitled,
"Little League Coach Gets Hit in

96
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:31,422
the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then
Vomits in a Garbage Can."

97
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:34,191
I don't wanna give anything
away. Let's just watch.

98
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:35,893
(bat connects with ball,
man groans, vomits)

99
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,928
BOTH:
Oh!

100
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:39,296
(chuckling)

101
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:41,131
See? 'Cause,
'cause he got hit...

102
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,466
...right in the nuts,

103
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:45,502
BOTH:
The fat kid just runs away.

104
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:47,437
Trey Platt.

105
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,306
I can't believe

106
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:51,308
my father's funeral service is
being led

107
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,644
by Trey "The Noogie Machine"
Platt.

108
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,012
That guy gave you noogies?

109
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,880
What, did he carry
a stepladder?

110
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:59,650
He made me carry it.

111
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,753
So, my dad has these questions
he asks to help create

112
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:05,823
a theme for the service,
or whatever.

113
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:07,558
Question one:

114
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:10,694
"What were your last words
with the deceased?"

115
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:11,695
Lame.

116
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,631
Question two:

117
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,566
Wait...

118
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,768
My last words with
Marvin were lovely.

119
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,170
I've been thinking
about them a lot.

120
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,138
Me, too.

121
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,374
We went for a hike
in the snow

122
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,508
and had this amazing talk.

123
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:25,809
My last day with Pop,

124
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,345
he taught my son
how to skate.

125
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,450
Well, this is
clearly yielding nothing.

126
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:34,518
Thanks, Dad.

127
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,386
Guess I'll have
to fill the time

128
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,855
with some jokes... again.
(scoffs)

129
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,826
"Last words" seems
like a good theme.

130
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:44,728
Marshall, do you
remember the last thing

131
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,463
your father said to you?

132
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,534
Bye, sweetie.
Bye, Mom.

133
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,169
Son,

134
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,839
there's something I want to say
before I leave.

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,076
Yeah, Dad?

136
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:03,747
Could I snag that extra
pork chop for the flight?

137
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:06,417
I was gonna make
a sandwich with that, Dad.

138
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:07,518
Ah...
Dad, don't they have

139
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,519
food on the plane?

140
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,989
Yeah, but plane food is ass.

141
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:15,859
"Plane food is ass."

142
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:17,728
Those are the last words

143
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,064
my father will ever say to me.

144
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,616
Right after I denied the man
a pork chop.

145
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:24,234
Oh, God.

146
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:29,907
Wait!

147
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:30,941
I'm wrong!

148
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:32,876
I'm wrong! That wasn't it!

149
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:34,611
They couldn't find a cab...

150
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:35,946
Hey, Marshall!

151
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,581
<i>so my dad called up from
the street. Marshall!</i>

152
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:40,951
Looks like rain out here!

153
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:45,723
I couldn't find an umbrella in
your closet!

154
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:47,491
You know who probably has
an umbrella?

155
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:48,859
<i>And then, well, see,</i>

156
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,762
<i>my dad grew up in a small town,
in another generation,</i>

157
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:54,431
<i>so sometimes--
totally well-meaningly--</i>

158
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:57,234
<i>he'd say stuff like...</i>

159
00:05:57,235 --> 00:06:00,037
The Koreans across the hall!

160
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:03,407
Hey, the Koreans are a
trustworthy and generous people!

161
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:04,708
Dad...

162
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:07,444
I betcha one of the Koreans has
an umbrella!

163
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:09,880
Heck, they're Koreans!

164
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:14,651
My dad's last words to me
were a string

165
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:17,421
of odd racial stereotypes.

166
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,423
All that stuff
was really nice!

167
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,592
Yeah!
It's positive racism!

168
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:25,062
This is worse
than the pork chop.

169
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:28,799
This next clip is entitled,
"Guy Playing Bagpipes

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,136
Gets Hit in the Nuts
by Low-Flying Seagull""

171
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,237
Let's see what happens.

172
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:34,571
(bagpipes play
"Amazing Grace" on video)

173
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:37,241
(seagulls squawking on video)
BOTH: Here he comes...

174
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:40,144
(thud on video) Oh! Oh!

175
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:42,279
(snickering)

176
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,281
'Cause he gets hit
right in the nuts.

177
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:48,552
BOTH: And then the fat kid
loses his swim trunks.

178
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:50,204
Fall off. Shorts
just fall right off.

179
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:51,238
No, wait-- I'm wrong.

180
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,522
That wasn't it.

181
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:54,491
They couldn't find a cab,
so I went down there.

182
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,711
Hey, you were right.

183
00:06:57,712 --> 00:06:59,696
The Kangs did, in fact,
have an umbrella.

184
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,582
Of course they did.

185
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,499
Bye, sweetie.

186
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,251
Bye, Mom.

187
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:10,440
Hey, son, I just want to leave
you with a little advice.

188
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:16,113
<i>Rent Crocodile Dundee III.</i>

189
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:18,515
I caught it on the cable
last night.

190
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:20,283
It totally holds up!

191
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:25,355
<i>Crocodile Dundee III is the
second-best of the Croc trilogy,</i>

192
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:28,058
so maybe I can live
with that.

193
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,126
(cell phone beeps)

194
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:31,795
Oh, sorry,
my phone's charged.

195
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:35,799
I, uh, I hear you're a woman
who can get things.

196
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,801
I've been known to locate
certain objects

197
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:38,836
from time to time.

198
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:42,339
I need vodka
and dirty playing cards.

199
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:44,741
I got ya.

200
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:48,912
Oh, my God.

201
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:50,714
What is it?

202
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:55,485
I have a voice mail from my dad.

203
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:02,889
You have a voice mail
from your dad?

204
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,856
How?

205
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,858
My phone's been out of juice,

206
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:10,880
so he must've called me
the day the he, uh...

207
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,132
Baby, are you okay?

208
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:19,338
I hold in my hand the last words
my father will ever say to me.

209
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,275
I'm gonna hit play.

210
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,746
What's wrong?

211
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:30,349
<i>What if it's worse
than Crocodile Dundee III?</i>

212
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:34,553
I can't do this.
I can't...

213
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,689
My mom is about to collapse.
I'm gonna...

214
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,542
Wait-- no, no, baby...
Baby, I got it. Let me.

215
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:43,162
You should listen to it.

216
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,031
Just don't put
too much pressure on it.

217
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:46,249
She's right.

218
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,251
I mean, this idea that
someone's last words have

219
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:49,602
to be profound
and meaningful?

220
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,204
I mean, who can
live up to that?

221
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,438
BARNEY:
Exactly.

222
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:53,873
All those "famous
last word""

223
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:55,908
people supposedly said?
They're all made up.

224
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,811
Like that patriotic
dude, Nathan Hale,

225
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:00,546
from third-grade history?

226
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:03,950
My I only regret is I have

227
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:06,419
but one life to lose
for my country.

228
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,455
You know what his real
last words were?

229
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:12,525
I'm peeing my pants!

230
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:14,593
True story.

231
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:18,131
The point is,
last words are overrated.

232
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,966
Look, think of it
this way:

233
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,202
you get to hear your
dad's voice one last time.

234
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:25,738
I should go listen to this...

235
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,673
alone, okay?
I'll be back.

236
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:29,709
Okay.

237
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:34,714
Hey, so, um, I heard
you might have...

238
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,582
You heard right.

239
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,719
(whispers): I'm getting
a reputation.

240
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,921
So, what you need, mama?
Come here.

241
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:47,560
Guys, listen
to what just happened.

242
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:51,063
Judy, do you need a break?
I'm happy to cook for a while.

243
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:54,567
You think your snobby
New York cooking is

244
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:56,803
better than mine-- admit it!

245
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,072
Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't
you just whip up a batch

246
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:03,609
of your fancy tofu sushi bagels!

247
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,912
And choke on them!

248
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:07,813
Whoa.
Are you okay?

249
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:08,815
Listen!

250
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,117
(yawns)

251
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:14,120
I'm gonna go take a nap.

252
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:17,823
Judy's finally sleeping
and it's all because of me!

253
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:21,260
Guys, I have a role:
I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!

254
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,728
Well, but this day is

255
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:23,830
tough on you, too.

256
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,465
You sure you can
absorb all that?

257
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:28,401
Yeah! Robin gave me a little
orange pill from her purse.

258
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:29,835
I don't know what's in it,

259
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,804
but things are flowin'
pretty smooth right now.

260
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,739
Hey, stay hydrated.

261
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,442
Hey.

262
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:37,727
So?

263
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:40,713
I couldn't listen to it.

264
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:42,014
Guys, this is hard.

265
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:43,232
We know, baby.

266
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,151
But you'll always wonder,
if you don't.

267
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:46,486
Your dad loved you.

268
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,754
It almost doesn't matter
what he said.

269
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:49,722
It doesn't.
That's true.

270
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:50,790
MARSHALL:
Guys, guys, what if--

271
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,958
God forbid--

272
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,927
all of your dads
died right now?

273
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:58,898
What would their last words
to you have been? Seriously.

274
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,234
I know mine.

275
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,536
When I was in Cleveland
last month,

276
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,138
I went to visit
my dad at his...

277
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:08,641
post-divorce bachelor pad.

278
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:12,395
Been fun bro-ing out
with you tonight, T-Dawg.

279
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:16,816
Yeah... so glad we can we can
talk about our sex lives now.

280
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,851
That's totally an improvement.

281
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,453
I hooked up

282
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,355
with a younger woman
the other week--

283
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,924
Donna Bromstead.

284
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,492
My prom date?!

285
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,161
How far did you get, T-Dawg?

286
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,399
I have to go.

287
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,835
Ugh...

288
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:39,005
How would you like those
to be your father's last words?

289
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:40,373
Well, they might be.

290
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,409
Donna Bromstead's
husband is a cop.

291
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:49,014
Lawyered.

292
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,118
Lily?

293
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,686
(phone ringing)

294
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:54,971
Hello.

295
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:57,156
Lily, it's Dad.

296
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:59,759
Listen, I'm sort of in jail
for not paying taxes

297
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,260
for the last 25 years.

298
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,663
But bright side-- I thought
of a great new board game.

299
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:06,198
"Tax Evasion"--
ages six to ten.

300
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:09,135
Which is, ironically,
what I might be looking at.

301
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:12,371
Anyway, Pumpkin,
I need $15,000.

302
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:13,940
Fooled ya.

303
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,575
Leave a message after the beep.

304
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:17,109
We'll get back to ya.

305
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,645
Beep.

306
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:24,583
Lawyered.

307
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,954
Robin?

308
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,557
And so, despite the endless
disappointment you've caused me,

309
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,326
I pray that this will finally

310
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:36,178
be the year
you achieve something

311
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,530
of actual significance.

312
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:38,898
I'd love to stop

313
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,567
lying to my friends about you
being in a coma.

314
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:47,573
Anyway, the point is,
happy birthday, RJ.

315
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:48,641
Whoa-ho! Wow.

316
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,842
That's awful.

317
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:51,777
No, here's the
awful part.

318
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,514
You remembered my birthday!

319
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,752
Lawyered.

320
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:02,221
Now can we all just admit

321
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:04,790
that last words are,
in fact, a big deal?

322
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,592
Yes.
Yes.

323
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:09,161
Man, I always thought
I had it rough

324
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,964
not really knowing
my dad, but...

325
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,265
now I realize at least

326
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:16,502
I'll never have
to suffer like this.

327
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,070
Our next video is called

328
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:20,139
"German Shepherd Activates
Tennis Ball Cannon

329
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,807
While Fat Kid Sips
Energy Drink."

330
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:23,142
Barney, please, Barney!
It's...

331
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,444
No more videos, okay?

332
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,813
I just need a minute.

333
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,149
JUDY:
Okay...

334
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,652
okay, who is
responsible for this?

335
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:33,886
Who got Cousin Daphne drunk?

336
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,490
She is 15 years old.

337
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:39,558
Whoa, they grow
big out here.

338
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,329
And here's your
phone number back.

339
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,299
Judy, I...
I did it.

340
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,237
What possible excuse
could you have for this?

341
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:52,705
I'm from New York.

342
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,807
We think
getting minors drunk is funny.

343
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:58,577
There's nothing funny about
getting minors drunk!

344
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:00,613
You should be ashamed, Lily!

345
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:02,481
Ashamed!

346
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,052
Mmm!

347
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,220
Oh, cripes, that's tasty.

348
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,722
Mmm! Mmm!

349
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,859
That salad's the first food
she's eaten in two days.

350
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,778
Sure, it's mostly cheese,
mayonnaise and jelly beans,

351
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:16,996
but it counts.

352
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:18,614
Well, at least
someone's helping.

353
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,833
We haven't made
Marshall laugh once.

354
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,501
Yeah.

355
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,470
Showing videos of guys
getting hit in the nuts

356
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,105
wasn't going
to do anything.

357
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,773
I'm just stupid.
Stupid.

358
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:30,843
What we need to do is hit
each other in the nuts.

359
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,778
Yes.

360
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,347
Nothing beats the immediacy
of live theater.

361
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:38,317
But which one of us is
going to take the hit?

362
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,052
Hey, Marshall.

363
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,253
(laughing)

364
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:42,772
(strained):
So that's it?

365
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,458
No discussion?

366
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:47,593
I'm not going to listen.

367
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:49,628
<i>"Rent Crocodile Dundee II""</i>

368
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,998
are the last words that my
father will ever say to me,

369
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:57,002
and I think I can
live with that.

370
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:00,706
TED:
Is he laughing?

371
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:03,843
<i>Marshall really did think
he could live with that.</i>

372
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:06,846
<i>That is, until later,
at the memorial service.</i>

373
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:11,684
My last talk with Marvin
was so lovely.

374
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:15,755
<i>The stories his mother and
brothers told were so perfect.</i>

375
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:18,891
Then he picked my crying son
up off the ice.

376
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:20,392
He gave him a hug and said,

377
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:23,796
"Champ, it doesn't matter if you
fall down once in a while."

378
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,199
And as we hiked, a little deer
appeared on the path.

379
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,302
She hopped over to Dad
and started eating--

380
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,371
right out of his hand.

381
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:36,242
And then he kissed me
and he said...

382
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:38,677
"I will always be proud of you""

383
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:41,080
"Life is such a gift."

384
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:44,116
"You know something, gorgeous,

385
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,319
I'm the luckiest man alive."

386
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,088
(sniffling)

387
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,456
(voice breaking):
Lame.

388
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:52,625
These stories suck.

389
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:56,295
<i>(voice breaking): Doesn't hold a
candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.</i>

390
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:01,400
You're up next, baby.

391
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:06,672
I just need some air.

392
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:15,114
Baby, are you okay?

393
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:17,499
I have to listen to it.

394
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,265
It's a pocket dial.

395
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:37,636
It's nothing.

396
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:49,253
Hey, so it's a pocket dial.

397
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,656
You have so many great
memories with your dad.

398
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:54,758
Who cares about the last one?

399
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,226
She's right.
Your dad was hilarious.

400
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,061
You guys don't get it, okay?

401
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,564
None of you do.

402
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:03,600
My dad was my hero.

403
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:06,503
And he was my teacher.

404
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:09,272
And he was my best friend.

405
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:14,144
He always came through for me.

406
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:16,613
And now he's just gone.

407
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,750
And what am I left with?

408
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:23,120
(scratchy electronic sounds)

409
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:26,089
Thanks a lot, God!

410
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,090
Thank you!

411
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,192
You took my father--

412
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:32,996
the greatest man that
I have ever known--

413
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:36,399
and you ripped him off
this Earth, way too young!

414
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:40,103
And he'll never get to
meet our kids, Lily.

415
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,772
(scratchy sounds continue)

416
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:45,141
But we got this voice mail.

417
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:48,478
Thank you so much
for the voice mail!

418
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,680
It's a great comfort!

419
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:50,881
'Cause whenever
I'm starting

420
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:54,368
to feel lonely or sad,
or-- or you know what,

421
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,786
or maybe a little bit cheated,

422
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,120
at least I got

423
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,122
the sound of his pocket
to console me.

424
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:00,374
Marshall...

425
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,692
How is this fair?

426
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:05,746
You know, like,
an entire human life

427
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:08,365
and it just ends for
no reason, and...

428
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:11,969
and what are we left with?

429
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,503
(scratchy sounds continue)

430
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:15,439
Marshall?

431
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,810
Oh, looks like I've been calling
you for almost five minutes.

432
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,478
How's my pocket sound?

433
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,647
(laughing)

434
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:25,082
Oh, sorry about that, buddy.

435
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,619
Um, anyway, your mom and I had
such a great time seeing you.

436
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,821
I love you.

437
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:37,661
Looks like your dad
came through one last time.

438
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:48,872
"I love you."

439
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:52,676
My father's last words
to me are "I love you."

440
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:56,213
Ooh, and let me know if
you find my foot cream.

441
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,982
That fungus thing
is acting up again.

442
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:05,088
"I love you."

443
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,724
My father's last words to me
are "I love you."

444
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:09,092
Yes.
Yes, they were.

445
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:12,495
We heard it.
Loud and clear.

446
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:16,333
Bye, Pop.

447
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,936
<i>So Marshall finally
got up to speak.</i>

448
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:22,072
<i>Funny thing, though...</i>

449
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:26,143
Then my father said the last
words that he'll ever say to me:

450
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:30,280
<i>"Rent Crocodile Dundee III.</i>

451
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,182
"I caught it on the cable
last night

452
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,650
and it totally holds up."

453
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,752
<i>He decided to keep Marvin's
real last words</i>

454
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:38,221
<i>just for himself.</i>

455
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:40,140
Thanks.

456
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:41,892
For what?

457
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:45,011
I know what you've
been doing today.

458
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:47,664
And I really needed it.

459
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:49,632
Any time.

460
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:55,638
That dress makes you look
like a Kansas City whore.

461
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,776
Sorry, dear.
Last one.

462
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,247
<i>MARSHALL:
Oh, man.</i>

463
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:08,218
I should have rented
Crocodile Dundee III.

464
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:12,655
Okay, seriously,
how are you doing that?

465
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,626
Thanks.

466
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:19,729
I'll be right back.

467
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,468
And if I don't come back,

468
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:27,971
well, then these are
my last words to you all.

469
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:33,443
I really, really, really
love you guys.

470
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:37,013
Now I'm going
to go drop a deuce.

471
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:39,483
(all groaning)

472
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:42,752
