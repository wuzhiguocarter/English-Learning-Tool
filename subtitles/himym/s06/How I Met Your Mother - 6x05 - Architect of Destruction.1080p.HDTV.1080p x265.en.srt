1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:03,358
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:03,483 --> 00:00:06,559
<i>I was designing the new headquarters
for Goliath National Bank,</i>

3
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:09,258
<i>which meant working side by side
with your Uncle Barney.</i>

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,610
I love your idea
about a giant rooftop ring of fire

5
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:13,554
you can jump through
with a motorcycle,

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,183
but I tweaked it slightly and...
this is still super bad-ass.

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:20,705
It's now a patio garden
where you can bring a nice bag lunch.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,688
Sick.

9
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,475
Dude.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,450
Working together
is gonna be legen...

11
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,675
Wait for it.

12
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:33,699
I'll send you an inter-office memo with
the rest cause we freakin work together!

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,536
<i>Everything was going great.
That is, right up until Barney said...</i>

14
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:40,498
Big news. The board finally settled on
a site for the building.

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,275
<i>It was the site of The Arcadian,
one of New York's grandest old hotels.</i>

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,375
<i>In its heyday, it was the New
York home to kings and queens.</i>

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,650
<i>But lately...</i>

18
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:53,929
<i>... mostly just queens.</i>

19
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,054
Hi, handsome.

20
00:00:55,697 --> 00:00:56,889
Lookin' for a date?

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,830
No, thank you.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,070
Still got it.

23
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,523
Barney, we have to talk.

24
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,774
Sure. What's up?

25
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,402
- Excuse me, Mr. Stinson.
- Not now, Trish!

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,779
But there's an urgent memo
for Mr. Mosby.

27
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,994
- "Dary."
- Legendary!

28
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,080
So, what's on your mind?

29
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:23,708
I can't design the building.

30
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,680
6x05 - Architect of Destruction (1.00)
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

31
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:44,770
Not the slipper socks
with the rubber soles.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,069
I work so hard to set the mood,

33
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:50,366
and when I see those,
I feel the egg go

34
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:52,486
right back up my Fallopian tube.

35
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:55,172
Baby, these satin sheets
are slippery.

36
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:57,074
- Papa needs traction.
- Traction?

37
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,119
As you know, Papa likes
to get down with enthusiasm.

38
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,912
Please stop calling yourself "Papa."

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,196
And without traction, Papa's likely
to boogie himself right out of bed.

40
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,997
It's either these or soccer cleats.

41
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,851
So I talked to Robin.

42
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,424
I guess she and Max
hooked up last night.

43
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,635
<i>Kids, as you may remember, Max was
a friend of Marshall's from law school,</i>

44
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>with whom Robin was really
starting to hit it off.</i>

45
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,000
Nice! I love that guy.

46
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,425
Max is both his name
and his level of awesomeness.

47
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,013
He's a sweet guy.
She feels really comfortable with him.

48
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:30,900
They bonded over hockey.
I guess he has a small penis,

49
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,276
but they want to double-date
next weekend.

50
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,321
Why would you tell me that?

51
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,156
So you'll clear your schedule.

52
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:38,866
The other part!

53
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:40,493
The small penis thing?

54
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,257
Don't! Stop saying that!
Why do you keep saying that?

55
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:46,537
I don't want to know that. I'm not gonna
be able to look the guy in the eye.

56
00:02:46,662 --> 00:02:49,001
I'm certainly not going
to be able to call him "Max."

57
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,355
That's insane.

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,505
Just because you know
Max has a small penis...

59
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,266
Just don't!

60
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,842
You're kidding me.

61
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,039
I'm sorry. I can't do this
if it means tearing down The Arcadian.

62
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:01,722
It's an architectural landmark.

63
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,472
Plus, people live there.

64
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:05,676
How does GNB plan
to get hundreds of residents

65
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,520
- to just up and leave?
- Snakes.

66
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,224
- Did you say "snakes"?
- I don't recall saying "snakes".

67
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,484
Ted, I know you love crappy
old stuff no one cares about.

68
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:17,163
But I'm gonna give you
four words to live by:

69
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:20,675
New is always better.

70
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,660
New is always better?

71
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:24,864
You know who's
a million times hotter

72
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,986
than the hottest girl
I've ever slept with?

73
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:30,659
Her okay-looking friend
I haven't seen naked.

74
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:31,784
Why?

75
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,017
Because new is always better.

76
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:36,549
And this theory
applies to everything?

77
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,008
Everything.

78
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,637
So, those new <i>Star Wars</i> movies...
Those are better than the old ones?

79
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:44,693
The first three barely mention

80
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,049
the intricacies
of intergalactic trade law.

81
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,787
And when you're
at a Guns n' Roses concert,

82
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:52,362
you're like, "Yeah, yeah,
Paradise City, whatever.

83
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:55,216
When are they gonna rock me
some Chinese Democracy?".

84
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,612
Axl's really matured
as a songwriter, Ted.

85
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:01,240
I'd like to buy my friend a drink.

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,700
What's your oldest Scotch?

87
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,757
Glenmckenna, aged 30 years
in oak casks.

88
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:08,122
- Amazing.
- And what's your newest scotch?

89
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:11,178
Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch.

90
00:04:11,607 --> 00:04:13,377
Don't let it touch your skin.

91
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,021
Your call, buddy.

92
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,384
A glass of the Jumbo Jim's
Grape Scotch sounds lovely.

93
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,054
Lots of ice.

94
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,892
New is always better, Ted!
That's a rule.

95
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,833
Just like bigger is always better!

96
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,478
That's not true.

97
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,772
Sometimes smaller is better.

98
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,340
"Hey, look how big
my cell phone is!"

99
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,444
You don't hear people say that.

100
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,631
You want something compact

101
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:43,114
and efficient that fits comfortably
in your pocket,

102
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,219
and I think Max is just a great guy.

103
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:47,786
- Lily told you.
- Told him what?

104
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,681
Max has a small penis.

105
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:54,126
- How can you speak of such things?
- Girls talk about everything.

106
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,212
Size, shape,
left or right leaning orientation...

107
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,457
Length, resemblance to
a historical figure,

108
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:01,800
such as Winston Churchill...
Yes, that's one of you.

109
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,253
- Girth, grooming...
- How can you speak of such things?

110
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,860
You're kidding.

111
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,758
Every time I mention
a woman you don't know,

112
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:11,839
the first thing you say is, "Boobs?"

113
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:14,806
Not the complete sentence,
"Does she have big boobs?"

114
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,731
Which also would not be great.
Just: "Boobs?"

115
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,605
- I do not do that.
- My friend Lori from work...

116
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,980
Boobs? Damn it.

117
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,034
But... seriously.

118
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,282
Boobs?

119
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,882
So why is it okay
for guys to talk about boobs,

120
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,704
but the moment we bring up a topic
like Max's small penis...

121
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,291
I'm gonna pretend this
conversation never happened.

122
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,962
Impossible. Max's penis is stuck
in my brain like a splinter.

123
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,137
Like a splinter-sized splinter.

124
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,675
Speaking of disappointing weenies...

125
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,468
Tell them what you told me.

126
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,782
I want to ask the board at GNB

127
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:50,346
to move the site for
the new headquarters so we don't have

128
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,143
- to tear down a classic old building.
- I still don't get this.

129
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,932
Why, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

130
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,657
do you want to ruin...

131
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:59,525
Wait a minute.

132
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:01,702
Who's the girl?

133
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:05,318
- Of course there's a girl.
- What? I...

134
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:07,456
There's no girl.

135
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,951
Why would you even...

136
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,062
Her name is Zoey.

137
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,497
Boobs?

138
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:20,879
Beautiful building, right?

139
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:23,882
Look, mister, you
are very convincing,

140
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,750
and I am very flattered.

141
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:29,054
Confused, even.
But I'm not looking...

142
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,772
I'm not a drag queen.

143
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,476
But you definitely have me
rethinking this eye shadow.

144
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:36,723
Not only is she funny,

145
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:39,184
hot and genetically female,

146
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:40,607
but get this...

147
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,537
Look at the Palladian windows,
the rusticated stonework,

148
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:45,904
the marble cornices...

149
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,453
She's an architecture nerd!

150
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,249
A hot architecture nerd!

151
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:51,535
That's the dream!

152
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,940
Whose dream?

153
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:55,539
We wound up talking for hours.

154
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,502
I love how old parts
of the city are.

155
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,658
It makes me feel
connected to history.

156
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:04,049
Old is always better.
I can't wait to be old.

157
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,174
Me, too.

158
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,955
You can wear elastic everything.

159
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,219
Your lipstick doesn't have
to stay inside the lines.

160
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,431
You can shoplift and pretend
you're just confused.

161
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:16,101
You could nap anywhere.
Even while driving.

162
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:19,980
It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be
all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.

163
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,838
Well, I'd say you got
a pretty long wait.

164
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:26,142
That's sweet.

165
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,482
It would be sweeter
if you hadn't thought

166
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:31,283
I was a tranny before,
but it's still sweet.

167
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:35,633
Ted, that's so romantic.
I want to fill a pillowcase

168
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:37,956
with dead batteries
and beat you with it.

169
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:42,503
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

170
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,675
Will you sign this petition?

171
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,012
"Save The Arcadian""

172
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,432
We are gonna stop the bastards
at GNB from demolishing it.

173
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,181
Will you support us?

174
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,772
And you said...?

175
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:04,316
Where do I sign?

176
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,655
Grape scotch.
Not bad.

177
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,759
Ted, you only think
The Arcadian needs to be saved

178
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:21,124
because some pretty girl thinks that.
And seriously...

179
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,249
Boobs?

180
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,335
This isn't about the girl.
It's about the building.

181
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:28,070
And what did this "Zoey" say

182
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:31,664
when she found out that you're the one
tearing down her beloved Arcadian?

183
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:33,334
That you, Ted Mosby,

184
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,783
are the Architect Of Destruction?

185
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,056
Sweet wrestling name alert.

186
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:40,824
Well...

187
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,228
It's a funny thing about that...

188
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,272
So what do you do, Ted?

189
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:46,982
I'm a veterinarian.

190
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:49,192
What? I panicked!

191
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,924
This whole Arcadian
thing is classic Mosby.

192
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,489
Changing your personality
to fit some girl.

193
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,200
I don't do that.

194
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:00,537
Off to meet Steph.

195
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:02,928
We're adrenaline junkies!

196
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:10,255
Penelope is taking me to
the Battle of Gettysburg.

197
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:12,282
We're gonna eat squirrel!

198
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:21,183
Look, she's really hot, okay?

199
00:09:25,596 --> 00:09:26,688
Come on! Come on!

200
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,049
We all change a little
for whoever we're into.

201
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:31,109
Barney pretended
to be a rabbi to get laid.

202
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:33,693
Asian girls love them some Jews.

203
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,240
And Marshall never would've listened to
The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.

204
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,743
I think you got
that backwards there, Chief.

205
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,711
And you're welcome.

206
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:44,547
The point is, you weren't pretending

207
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,703
to like the Indigo Girls
for the other person.

208
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:49,175
You realized you liked them
because of the other person.

209
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,213
Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian.

210
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,758
Did GNB really put snakes
in The Arcadian?

211
00:09:56,978 --> 00:09:58,386
Technically, they were eggs.

212
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:01,195
- Did you just say "eggs"?
- I don't recall saying "eggs."

213
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:04,017
So I walk into my boss's office

214
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:05,596
and suddenly I realize,

215
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:08,230
"Holy crap, I'm about to quit".

216
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:09,498
<i>Small penis.</i>

217
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,316
<i>You have a small penis.</i>

218
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:14,695
<i>That's super interesting,
but you have a small penis.</i>

219
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,436
<i>Damn it, Marshall!</i>

220
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:19,743
<i>Think of any two words
other than "small" or "penis".</i>

221
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:22,014
<i>Got it: small penis.</i>

222
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:22,994
<i>Damn it!</i>

223
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:26,456
I think it is so cool
that you started your own law firm.

224
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,757
Right now
it's a pretty small practice.

225
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,586
I bet it's not that small.

226
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:37,801
Bro, it's pretty small.

227
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:41,242
But you know what they say.
The important thing is how you use it.

228
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,556
"The motion of the ocean".
That whole thing.

229
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:46,483
He said it's small and everybody's fine
with that. Let's just move on.

230
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:50,144
I'm just saying that I bet
it's bigger than he thinks.

231
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:52,274
And thick.

232
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,668
Everything about it is tiny.

233
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,300
The office is tiny.
The conference room is tiny.

234
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,058
Plus, I got a very small staff.

235
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:01,183
Let's order!

236
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:05,103
As I was mustering
the courage to call Zoey</i>

237
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,770
and tell her my true identity...

238
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:07,622
Zoey...

239
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:09,682
I'm Batman.

240
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,116
That'd be cool.

241
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,189
<i>... the strangest thing happened.</i>

242
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,119
I need your help.

243
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:22,377
Just to warn you.

244
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:25,432
What I'm about to show you is not
a hundred percent legal.

245
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:28,582
Wasn't expecting bunnies.

246
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:30,107
I stole them.

247
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:32,159
My animal rights group
liberated these guys

248
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,830
from an evil cosmetics company.

249
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:35,692
And I figured, "Hey, Ted's a vet.

250
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,292
He can check them out
and make sure they're okay".

251
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,197
Absolutely. Just let me run up
and get my bag of vet supplies.

252
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,244
Why would I say that?

253
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,829
Well, I know what I'm getting.

254
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:49,587
The porterhouse.

255
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:51,213
I've had it here before.

256
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:53,414
It is like this. It's huge.

257
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,182
Spare no expense, buddy.
Dinner is on me and get dessert.

258
00:11:58,307 --> 00:12:01,885
Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake?
I just want you to be happy.

259
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:05,055
Thanks, man.
Next time, it is on me.

260
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:08,074
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.
- Totally.

261
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,682
We'll just be here.

262
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,437
You're great.

263
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:17,750
Thanks, bro.

264
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,819
It's... it's going on a while.

265
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:20,987
I know.

266
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:22,853
Thanks.

267
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,464
Damn, baby, be cool!

268
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,577
You're acting like
he has six months to live.

269
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:28,803
It's your fault!

270
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:31,331
You ladies
and your salty sailor talk!

271
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:34,292
Come on! What about you men
and your locker room talk?

272
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,519
Locker room talk.

273
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:37,837
Do you want to know what it's like
in a men's locker room?

274
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:42,455
It's just a bunch
of uncomfortable dudes

275
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,164
trying to get out of there
as quickly as possible.

276
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,644
And one old guy
just letting it all hang out.

277
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:50,100
Are you suggesting

278
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,935
that guys don't talk about sex?

279
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:54,634
Yes, we do,
but you know what we say?

280
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,973
"I hit that."

281
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:57,353
"I got some."

282
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,554
"I tapped it."

283
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,277
"I squeezed those."
Discreet and efficient.

284
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:02,821
Not to mention classy.

285
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:04,638
Thank God that I'm not dating.

286
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,371
If Lily talked in that much detail
about our sex life,

287
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,827
I'd probably kill myself.

288
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:17,832
- What did you tell her?
- Practically nothing.

289
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:19,796
We don't talk about you!

290
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,365
Are you sure?

291
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:25,342
That argument
has no traction whatsoever.

292
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:31,307
You broke in and stole these guys?
Aren't you worried about getting arrested?

293
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,518
Nah. I've been arrested
lots of times.

294
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,522
CHAINED HERSELF TO
A 100-YEAR-OLD REDWOOD

295
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:40,525
STOLE POLICE HORSE
AT ANTI-WAR RALLY

296
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:44,070
SET CAR ON FIRE AFTER 2009
GUNS'N ROSES CONCERT

297
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:46,906
Chinese Democracy.

298
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,493
You're a little bit crazy.

299
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:53,078
I'm usually crazy for a good cause.

300
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,915
I can't just sit by while
voiceless people or animals,

301
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,101
or even buildings get screwed over.

302
00:13:58,226 --> 00:14:01,277
I'm certainly not going to just sit by
while GNB turns The Arcadian

303
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:03,006
into a soulless metal box.

304
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,856
Although I hear there's
a lovely rooftop patio

305
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,862
where folks can enjoy
a nice bag lunch.

306
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,974
I will find the bastards
at GNB responsible for this,

307
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,642
and I promise you,

308
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,854
I will take them down.

309
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:23,189
This woman is an anarchist,

310
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:25,595
a sociopath, a lunatic,

311
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,596
and for the love of God,

312
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:28,698
boobs!

313
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,366
Solid C-cup, perky bounce.

314
00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:32,035
Momentary grudging respect.

315
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,930
Zoey does
what she believes is right,

316
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,596
and I want to do the same thing.

317
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,460
We have to find a new site.

318
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:42,253
That is never gonna happen.

319
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:46,549
I can't tear down The Arcadian.
I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.

320
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,889
<i>I appreciate the great turnout,
but just so we're all on the same page,</i>

321
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,433
<i>this is not a rally
to legalize marijuana.</i>

322
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,390
Oh, bummer!

323
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:05,193
I'm so glad you came.

324
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,403
You really got to me
the other night.

325
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:10,031
I want to "Save The Arcadian."

326
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,283
Great.
I'll grab you a picket sign.

327
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:17,622
<i>Do you want
"GNB puts the douche in fiduciary..."</i>

328
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,334
or "It's always 4:20 somewhere"?

329
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,170
Dudes, you forgot your signs!

330
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,274
Looking up at that old structure,</i>

331
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,258
<i>I realized I wasn't letting
my feelings for Zoey mislead me.</i>

332
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:32,711
<i>This building
really was worth saving.</i>

333
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,434
Everything okay?

334
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:47,569
You work for GNB?

335
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:52,490
Why are you dressed like a wizard?

336
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:54,951
She was really hot, okay?

337
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,795
How did you do that?

338
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:06,841
Simple.

339
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,084
I rented the chair.

340
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,858
The bunny was here already.

341
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,302
I waited to do the dramatic swivel
until I heard you enter.

342
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,720
The billboard.

343
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:14,888
I had to.

344
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:18,101
Now you have no shot with her,
you'll realize you never cared about it,

345
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,288
- and everything goes back to normal.
- You're wrong, I do care.

346
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,763
And I'm still quitting.

347
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,185
Don't you get it?

348
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,524
We're tearing down
The Arcadian either way.

349
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:30,153
It's a stupid old piece-of-crap,
run-down, snake-infested dump!

350
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,113
Are there snakes?!

351
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:33,805
Who mentioned snakes?

352
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,975
And stop shouting!
You're scaring Cottontail.

353
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:38,870
You named it?

354
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:42,165
You took longer to get here,
we bonded, I'm keeping her.

355
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:43,499
The point is,

356
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:47,503
you now have a chance
to design your own building.

357
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,381
You can do whatever you want.

358
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:51,966
You're right.

359
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,844
You're right.
I can design it however I want.

360
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,679
So you're back in?

361
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:58,214
Yeah.

362
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,984
That night,
as I worked on a new design</i>

363
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:05,075
<i>that just might solve
all my problems...</i>

364
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,044
<i>Marshall was visited
by a disturbing vision.</i>

365
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:12,362
He thinks I like this...</i>

366
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,488
But it feels disgusting.

367
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,533
<i>Uh, it looks disgusting.</i>

368
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,594
- Is this working for you?
- "Is this working for you?"

369
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:26,116
Oh, of course, because what woman
doesn't like being slobbered on

370
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,628
while some giant paws
at her nether regions

371
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,506
<i>like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?</i>

372
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,279
- You're bad.
- More Cosmos?

373
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:38,554
I can't do this! I can't stop thinking
about you and Robin!

374
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:42,776
Oh, I've had that a couple times.
Lean into it and let it fuel things.

375
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:44,947
Look, no. You know what?

376
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,521
Why don't you just

377
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:49,899
call Robin,
and have a good laugh about it?

378
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,862
Traction could have prevented that.

379
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:04,455
Hope you don't mind,
we changed the billboard.

380
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,745
That explains a few voicemails.

381
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:13,506
I think we can save The Arcadian.

382
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:16,069
Maybe not
in the way you were picturing,

383
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:19,294
but I stayed up all night
working on a new concept.

384
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,390
What if my design could incorporate
The Arcadian's facade

385
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:24,142
into the new GNB headquarters?

386
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:28,284
<i>It was one of those moments in life
where everything comes together...</i>

387
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,154
<i>the girl, the building,</i>

388
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:31,774
<i>everything,</i>

389
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:32,775
<i>until...</i>

390
00:18:34,486 --> 00:18:36,279
- Are you married?
- Yeah.

391
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,116
So, the facade
will be completely preserved?

392
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,497
This isn't about the girl.
It's about the building.

393
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,381
<i>Yeah, it was about the girl.</i>

394
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,185
What are you doing?

395
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,546
It won't work.

396
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:56,229
Zoey, The Arcadian
was a really great building once,

397
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:58,009
but it's full of snakes.

398
00:18:58,177 --> 00:18:59,635
- Snakes?
- I don't recall it.

399
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,435
Then he gets this panicked look
on his face, says,

400
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,517
"I can't do this," and storms out.

401
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:07,810
That is weird.

402
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:09,729
But here's the crazier part.

403
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:11,939
No.
You know what?

404
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:14,541
Papa don't back down from a fight.

405
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,512
So why don't you tell Robin...
about this!

406
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:21,954
It was amazing.

407
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:25,120
He was passionate, animalistic,

408
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:26,871
a complete stud.

409
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:31,000
He's right there
making you say all this?

410
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:34,253
"You're like a Greek god",

411
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:35,793
I moaned, as the...

412
00:19:36,729 --> 00:19:40,009
- I can't read that, baby.
- "Musky scent of man."

413
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:43,109
"As the musky scent of man

414
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:46,133
"and Marshall's sure-footed traction

415
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:48,601
"intoxicated

416
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,062
- "and overpowered me."
- That sounds real.

417
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,779
<i>And as for Zoey, it was funny.</i>

418
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:54,999
<i>I'd lied to her,
then completely let her down.</i>

419
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,955
<i>And I barely knew her.
But there was something about her.</i>

420
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,113
<i>I couldn't help but wonder
if I'd ever see her again.</i>

421
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,038
You'll have to come out of your hole
at some point, you son of a bitch!

422
00:20:10,374 --> 00:20:11,710
Legalize it!

423
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:14,627
Ready.

424
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,962
Aim.

425
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:17,547
Fire!

426
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,386
<i>Why, yes.</i>

427
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,497
<i>Yes, I would see her again.</i>

428
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:27,642
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

429
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:29,677
How's it going with Robin?

430
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,395
I think I have to break up with her.

431
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,397
- Why?
- You with her?

432
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,965
Yeah, well, there's this...

433
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:40,518
kind of weird thing
she likes to do in the bedroom.

434
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:49,435
What's not for everyone?

435
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:53,499
Come on, what is it?

436
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:54,995
Come on, bro.

437
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:56,919
This is a locker room.

438
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,212
What do you think it was, Murray?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
