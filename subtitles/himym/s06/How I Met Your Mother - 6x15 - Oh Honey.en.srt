<i>NARRATOR: Kids, after Uncle
Marshall lost his father,</i>

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,203
<i>he decided to stay home a while
to take care of his mother.</i>

3
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:07,471
(phone ringing)
But the longer he stayed there,

4
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:10,207
<i>the more it was like
he had never left Minnesota.</i>

5
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,409
Eriksen residence,
Marshall speaking.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,977
(laughs)
Oh, that is too cute.

7
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:14,978
Say it again.

8
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:15,979
No.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,281
It's called manners, jerk.

10
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,083
Now, what's-what's going on
in New York?

11
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:20,217
Give me something.

12
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:22,653
There is one thing
that's been going on.

13
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:28,726
Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.

14
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:30,527
<i>to save an old building
from being torn down</i>

15
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:33,497
<i>and replaced by a new building
that I'd been hired to design.</i>

16
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:34,631
And yet somehow, despite this,

17
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,834
<i>we had all managed
to become friends.</i>

18
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:37,868
<i>Which brings us to the night</i>

19
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,237
<i>Aunt Robin decided
to cook dinner.</i>

20
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:47,678
I thought the oven was Celsius.

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,912
It's okay.

22
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:50,481
We got hot dogs.

23
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:53,684
Yeah, and it's not like
you can screw up a hot dog.

24
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:56,720
Oh, God.

25
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,155
This is so good.

26
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:01,091
I'm gonna finish it
in the bathroom.

27
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,462
Could someone pass the ketchup?

28
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:07,164
I hope I can pass this hot dog.

29
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,566
Oh.
(glass shatters)

30
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,135
Oops. Well, looks
like someone's

31
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:13,504
going out in the cold
to get more ketchup.

32
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:16,039
Oh, come on, man,
I brought the wine.

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,907
Which is all gone.

34
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:18,776
Oops.

35
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:19,876
(sighs)

36
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,061
All right, I tell you what--

37
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,013
you get this one bottle,
I'll get the next three.

38
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,348
Hmm, tell you what-- no dice.

39
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:25,582
I'll get
the next hundred.

40
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,717
You're not getting out of this.

41
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,285
You want to go on a date
with my hot cousin?

42
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,719
I'll get the ketchup.

45
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,636
Robin, I just want you to know,

46
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,138
it's either this story you're
telling me or another game

47
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:51,308
of Clue against myself,
so make it good.

48
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:52,309
Oh, it's good.

49
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,544
You see, after that night,

50
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,979
none of us heard from Zoey
for a while.

51
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,515
<i>Finally, Ted called her up.
Hello.</i>

52
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,350
So are we ever gonna
see you again?

53
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,452
Because, if I recall correctly,

54
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,754
you owe me a date
with your hot cousin.

55
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:05,556
You still want to do that?

56
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,357
Yes. And we miss you.

57
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,993
But the cousin thing mostly.
Let's get that going.

58
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:11,445
Don't worry,
Ted, she's cute.

59
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:12,429
(Barney coughing)

60
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,832
"Cute" means "fat""

61
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,433
She's not fat.

62
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:19,937
(coughing):
"Not fat" means "ugly""

63
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,472
Oh, here she is.

64
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:24,842
(coughing): I take
back everything I said.

65
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:27,377
That girl is
extremely attractive.

66
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:28,829
Hey, Zoey.
Hey.

67
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,682
Ted, this is
my cousin...

68
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,016
<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, to be honest,</i>

69
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,551
<i>I don't quite remember
this girl's name.</i>

70
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:35,819
<i>None of us do,</i>

71
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,888
<i>because as this story
has been told and retold,</i>

72
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,857
<i>we've always just referred
to her as...</i>

73
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,625
Honey.

74
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,026
Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.

75
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,528
<i>And here's why.</i>

76
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:47,431
She is a lovely person--

77
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,568
warm, intelligent,
just kind of gullible.

78
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,636
It's like, every word

79
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:54,805
out of her mouth
makes you want to be like,

80
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,007
"Oh, honey."

81
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,375
Interesting.

82
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,693
Show your work.

83
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,079
My apartment building
is so safe.

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,849
My landlord-- he even installed
a security camera in my shower.

85
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,551
Oh, honey.

86
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,686
Maybe I should feel weird
about giving a stranger

87
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,922
my Social Security number,

88
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:15,225
but the guy's a Nigerian prince.

89
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,361
Oh, honey.

90
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:20,230
I just had
a great TV audition.

91
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,066
Behind the KFC where
the executive producer works

92
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,968
on the weekends.

93
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,737
Oh, honey.

94
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:31,141
<i>Long story short,
I'm going to be on Lost.</i>

95
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:33,343
Oh, honey.

96
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,361
I know.

97
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,246
You just want to wrap her up
in a blanket

98
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:37,481
and give her a cup of tea.

99
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,682
She's, like, this

100
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,983
little lost lamb

101
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:42,586
who needs to be protected
from the wolves.

102
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:44,054
Speaking of whom...

103
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:46,790
Yeah, I always get those
e- mails from Michelle Obama

104
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,876
and sometimes
Obama himself.

105
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:52,996
Oh, honey.

106
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,464
<i>ROBIN:
So the night went on,</i>

107
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:56,533
<i>and eventually
everyone went home,</i>

108
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,902
<i>except for Ted and Honey.</i>

109
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:01,138
Wow, an architect.

110
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,439
How fascinating.

111
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,874
Why do they call
'em coasters?

112
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,209
<i>And Barney.</i>

113
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,097
Okay, time to go home.

114
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,549
Ted, a word.

115
00:04:15,553 --> 00:04:17,387
God, I hate these situations.

116
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:19,239
What are we gonna do about this?

117
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,724
What are you talking about?

118
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,926
Come on, Ted, it's obvious.

119
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,528
Honey's vibing on me.

120
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,596
What?

121
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,564
It's called body language.

122
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,167
Remember when she was
touching your arm

123
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,768
and leaning in real close?
Mm-hmm.

124
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:35,973
Well, while that was happening,
the straw in her drink

125
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:39,075
was pointed right at me.

126
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:42,012
I mean...

127
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:43,981
that's as clear
as a signal gets,

128
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,132
so...

129
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,752
I'm so sorry, man.

130
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:51,788
You're right.

131
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,924
She's all yours, buddy.

132
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,759
I'd say
hump her brains out,

133
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,694
but someone obviously
already has.

134
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,263
<i>ROBIN:
Good for you.</i>

135
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:01,932
Ted Mosby does not
take advantage

136
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,300
of poor,
helpless honeys.

137
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,102
Yeah, actually,
there's another reason

138
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,937
that I didn't go home
with her.

139
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:07,904
Hmm?

140
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:08,672
He's gay!

141
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:10,741
Mom, hang up!

142
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,609
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,644
(scoffs)

144
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,078
Go on.

145
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,346
Yeah, actually,
there's another reason

146
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,048
that I didn't go home
with her.

147
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:19,216
Hmm?

148
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:22,252
I'm in love with Zoey.

149
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,221
Oh, my God.

150
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:25,756
Oh, my God!

151
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:26,623
Mom!

152
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:28,809
Sorry.

153
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,150
Ted's in love with Zoey?

154
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,052
But, but she's married.

155
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,087
That boy needs an intervention.

156
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,722
Funny you should say that.

157
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,357
Does anyone know
why we're here?

158
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,992
LILY: Yeah, who called
this intervention?

159
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,694
I did. It's for me.

160
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,579
This is
about the coffee breath.

161
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,248
Finally. Hmm, no,
it's the shoulder hair.

162
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,700
BARNEY:
Guys, just let

163
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,502
the man explain
how it's all

164
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:55,470
about his wearing
a lady's watch.

165
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,073
It's because
I'm in love with Zoey,

166
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:58,974
and she's married,

167
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,959
so it needs to stop.

168
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,612
And... intervene.

169
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,947
Are you sure
it's love?

170
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,350
(sighs)
Remember the ketchup bottle?

171
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,152
<i>She wasn't the one
who dropped it.</i>

172
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:13,989
<i>When she reached for it,
our fingers touched, and...</i>

173
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,524
(glass shatters)

174
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:19,227
I knew, right in that moment,
this isn't friendship.

175
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,430
This is love.

176
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,298
Wuss.

177
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,282
Marcus!

178
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,568
This is a private conversation!

179
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:30,005
So what'd the wuss do next?

180
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,407
This is love.

181
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:36,144
And this was
my grandmother's watch.

182
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:40,281
Anyway, now I have only one
course of action in front of me:

183
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,150
I have to end
my friendship with Zoey.

184
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,635
Isn't that
a little harsh?

185
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,486
Harsh?

186
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,520
Robin, a single guy

187
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,456
and a married woman
cannot be friends

188
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,424
if one's in love with the other.

189
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:51,460
Yeah, but Zoey is
friends with us now, too.

190
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,678
It's not like Ted can
just ghost out on her.

191
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,063
She'll always be around.

192
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,698
Then what am I
supposed to do?

193
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,799
Okay, just shut it down.

194
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,317
Okay, just ignore
your feelings.

195
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,169
If-If she asks you
for ketchup,

196
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,271
tell her to get it
her own damn self.

197
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,040
Look, I like Zoey.
Without her,

198
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,310
my dinner party wouldn't
have been such a success.

199
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,845
So those feelings
of yours--

200
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,879
shut 'em down.

201
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,749
Fine.

202
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,117
I'll shut 'em down.

203
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:19,321
And seriously,
mouthwash after coffee.

204
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:20,455
(phone line beeps)

205
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,859
Oh, um, that's my other line.

206
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,093
It's not a number I recognize.

207
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:26,294
So don't answer it.

208
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:27,796
(line beeps)

209
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,131
Yeah.

210
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,632
(Minnesotan accent):
Oh, my God,

211
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,534
you are so Minnesota.

212
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,136
You can't not answer the phone

213
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:35,203
because it would be rude.

214
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,304
(line beeps)
Well, it would be.

215
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,874
Good-bye.

216
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,909
Eriksen residence,
Marshall speaking.

217
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,710
Hey, Marshall.

218
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,677
Barney.

219
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:43,979
W- What number is this?

220
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,480
I'm up on burners, playa.

221
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,349
Too many crazies had
my old number,

222
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,152
so now I'm all about
disposable cell phones.

223
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,187
I'll use one for a while,
have my fun,

224
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,089
then dump it and get a new one.

225
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,991
And then I'll do the same
with my phone.

226
00:07:55,992 --> 00:08:00,328
Hey, uh, so Robin told me about
this whole Ted and Zoey thing.

227
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,297
Dude, she doesn't know
how to tell a story.

228
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,216
<i>I'll tell you that story.</i>

229
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,867
Hey, Zoey.

230
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:06,835
Hey.

231
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,087
Ted, this is
my cousin...

232
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,039
Honey.

233
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:15,510
<i>MARSHALL:
Uh...</i>

234
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:16,912
Robin's version was...

235
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,747
That is exactly how it happened.

236
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,881
So Ted did his best

237
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,983
to impress her,
but as per yoozh,

238
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,487
<i>he bored the pants
very much on her.</i>

239
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,606
Blah, blah, blah,
I'm an architect.

240
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,358
Blah, blah, blah,
I don't wear suits.

241
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,560
Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

242
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,196
Wow, an architect.

243
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:35,964
How fascinating.

244
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,232
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

245
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,867
Rambling architecture anecdote.

246
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,235
Blah, blah,

247
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,703
something about a bridge.

248
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:42,637
Blah, blah, blah...

249
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,706
(whispers):
Straw.

250
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,211
(whispers):
Coaster.

251
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,081
Okay, time to go home.

252
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,719
Anyway, I get Honey
back to her place.

253
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:00,088
Who's your daddy?

254
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,324
Okay, can we skip
this part, please?

255
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,727
Sure, I'll just summarize it.

256
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:09,331
(imitating squeaky bedsprings)

257
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:14,469
(squeaking accelerates)

258
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,273
(squeaking slows)

259
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,274
Okay, that's been

260
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,408
going on a while.

261
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,777
Only way I know how.

262
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:25,780
Any-who, next day,
I'm going into work.

263
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,615
<i>I run into Zoey.
Hey, Zoey.</i>

264
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:30,752
That cousin of yours--
Honey-- yowsa!

265
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,754
I must say, your family
tree has got a couple

266
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,923
of pretty big coconuts.

267
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,091
Thanks.

268
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,176
Yeah, we had a great
time last night.

269
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,929
And then just hand stuff
in the morning, so...

270
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,697
Wait, she didn't go home
with Ted?

271
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,065
Nope, he let me have her.

272
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,067
I have to say, it was
pretty noble of him.

273
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,504
He fell on his sword so that
she could fall on mine.

274
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,141
I won't bore you with the
details, but to summarize...

275
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:56,778
(imitating squeaky bedsprings)

276
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,649
She hugged me.

277
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,384
What was that all about?

278
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,718
Zoey's in love with Ted.

279
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,953
Marcus!

280
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,288
Wait, hear me out, Marshall.

281
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:09,324
<i>Zoey's in love with Ted,
but she's married,</i>

282
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,059
<i>so she tried to push him away</i>

283
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,428
<i>by setting him up
with her cousin instead.</i>

284
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,564
<i>But seeing Ted and Honey
hit it off was</i>

285
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:17,065
<i>more than her gentle heart
could bear,</i>

286
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:20,835
<i>so Zoey left early,
pricked by love's fickle thorn.</i>

287
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,537
<i>But then, the next morning,
upon learning</i>

288
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,740
<i>that Ted had not tasted
of Honey's sweet nectar,</i>

289
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:29,945
<i>her joy burst forth like
a blossoming flower in spring.</i>

290
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:31,947
Wow.

291
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:34,316
Zoey's in love with Ted.

292
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:38,587
Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that
new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts.

293
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,522
Would you like a Hertz Donut?

294
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:41,723
Sure.

295
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:47,829
Hey, where's the...?

296
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,497
No! Aah!

297
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:50,698
Hurts, don't it?

298
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,370
I can't believe
you fell for that, bro.

299
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:58,173
So Ted's in love with Zoey

300
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:00,875
<i>and Zoey's in love with Ted?</i>

301
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,544
Well, that-that's not
going to work.

302
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,179
I got to call Ted.

303
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,014
(phone ringing)

304
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,215
Hello.

305
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,350
Listen, Ted, um,

306
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,452
I got to tell you
something about Zoey.

307
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,755
Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you
something about Zoey, too.

308
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,424
Hey. I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd take you up

309
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,259
on that beer
you're about to offer me.

310
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,028
Can I get you a beer?

311
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,030
Oh, Ted, I'm so busy.

312
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,431
But I guess I got time for one.

313
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,283
Lead the way.

314
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,305
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

315
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,589
What?!

316
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,441
Fridge full of ketchup? How?

317
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,044
How, I ask you?

318
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,380
(laughs)

319
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,449
What?

320
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,120
Listen, Zoey, I, um...

321
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,890
I need to tell you something.

322
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,492
Um...

323
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,427
Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's.
You want anything?

324
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,295
Mom! Get off the phone!

325
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,164
Could you get
some more Bugles, please?

326
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,098
Of course, dear.

327
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,233
Marcus, hang up!

328
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,235
Both of you, hang up!

329
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,437
And we need ice cream.

330
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,907
Go on.

331
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:10,378
I, uh... I can't be
friends with you anymore.

332
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:14,315
And this may
seem strange, but...

333
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,151
you can't ask me why.

334
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,353
Wow.

335
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,990
Okay.

336
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,164
And that was it.

337
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,532
No more Zoey.

338
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,683
(line beeps)

339
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,101
Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily.

340
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,502
I should take that.

341
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,470
But, uh,

342
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,138
you're a good guy, Ted.

343
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,191
Hey, baby.

344
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,476
We hate Ted now.

345
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,712
Get on board
or the sexting stops.

346
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,181
Ted's a son of a bitch!

347
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,717
(cell phone chirps)

348
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,651
Oh, nice.

349
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:54,022
But, hey, um, baby,
go easy on Ted, okay?

350
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,357
He just, he just
ended things with Zoey.

351
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,592
Oh, I know.

352
00:12:57,593 --> 00:13:00,228
But did he tell you
the whole story?

353
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:04,466
I, uh, I can't be friends
with you anymore.

354
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,969
And you can't ask me why.

355
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:14,709
Why?

356
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,978
Lily hates you.

357
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,682
You hate me?

358
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,327
That's crazy.
I don't hate you.

359
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,830
Well, I know that's not true,
Lily. Ted told me everything.

360
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:32,665
He... Oh, really?

361
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,969
And-And what did Ted say,
exactly?

362
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,871
Lily hates you.

363
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,608
She hates you so much

364
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:44,411
it's hard to be around you.

365
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:48,415
So we can't be friends.

366
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,551
Oh, he... Oh, yeah.

367
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,186
Yeah, okay, well,

368
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,922
I- I guess there's no use
hiding it anymore.

369
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:57,957
I- I hate you.

370
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,192
Bitch.

371
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:01,728
I can't believe it.

372
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:04,631
I really thought
you and I were friends.

373
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,266
Lord knows I could

374
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,534
use a friend right now.

375
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:10,203
I've been going through
some pretty difficult stuff.

376
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,839
Difficult stuff?
What difficult stuff?

377
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I don't know.

378
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:15,575
Well, you did
the right thing, baby.

379
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,911
Not entirely.

380
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:20,213
Zoey, wait!

381
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:21,748
I don't hate you!

382
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:22,782
We just

383
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:25,919
can't be friends
anymore because...

384
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,754
Robin hates you.

385
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,589
(line beeps)

386
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,790
And that's Robin
on the other line.

387
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,058
Oh, well,
I'll let you take that.

388
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,026
Love you, baby!

389
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:35,395
Eriksen residence,
Marshall speaking.

390
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,814
Listen, Robin. I know.
I apologize for my wife.

391
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,165
She never should have...

392
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,501
Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.

393
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:42,652
Me?

394
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,270
You dragged me into this?!

395
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,538
You just went through a tragedy.

396
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,574
It's not like she's
gonna call you up and...

397
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:48,708
(line beeps)

398
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,460
Oh, God, that's my other line.

399
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:53,112
Oh, God, it's a 917 number,
and I don't recognize it!

400
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:54,180
I think it's Zoey!

401
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,348
Just don't answer it.

402
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,517
I can't not answer.
It's impolite.

403
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:58,751
Marshall, you can beat this.
I can't turn my back

404
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:00,019
on politeness.
You don't have to answer.

405
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,554
You can just let it ring.
Good manners are what

406
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:02,622
separate us from those "elbows
on the table" Wisconsinites.

407
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:03,857
You can do this.
I believe in you.

408
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:06,192
Don't do it, Marshall!
I'm sorry, Robin!

409
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,061
Eriksen residence.
Marshall speaking.

410
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:11,164
Hi. I spent the night
with your friend Barney

411
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,766
and he accidentally
left his phone

412
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,935
in my apartment, in the garbage.

413
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:17,103
But I've been

414
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:18,438
going through
all of his contacts

415
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,507
because I'm sure he wants
to get in touch with me.

416
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,009
After all,
he told me, uh...

417
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,811
I was his first.

418
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,846
Oh, honey.

419
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,781
Oh! Honey!

420
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,450
Zoey's cousin.

421
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:31,718
Hi.

422
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,752
Listen, um, about Barney...

423
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,854
Oh, yeah.
He's such a sweet guy.

424
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,090
Who's your daddy?

425
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:39,659
(giggles):
Oh...

426
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,127
Who's your daddy?

427
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,863
(sobbing):
I don't know.

428
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,102
I guess he recently decided
to get in touch with his dad.

429
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,437
His mom gave him
the guy's address.

430
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:54,057
So I wrote him a letter.

431
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,242
And I poured
my heart out.

432
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,979
And I gave him my number
and I told him to call me.

433
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,815
And he still
hasn't called me.

434
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:04,951
Oh, honey.

435
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:06,953
I mean,
I shouldn't be surprised.

436
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:09,822
Clearly, he wants
nothing to do with me.

437
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,524
Oh, honey.

438
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,326
I mean,

439
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:16,563
why else would
he let 30 years go by?

440
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:17,997
He's ashamed

441
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:20,833
to have me as a son.

442
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,869
Oh, honey,
he's not ashamed of you.

443
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,639
He's ashamed of himself.

444
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,807
I mean, look at you.

445
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,842
You're do so great without him.

446
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:32,679
I mean, you have an airline

447
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,281
and three Nobel Prizes,

448
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:37,584
and you play for the Yankees.

449
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:40,353
Four. Four Nobel Prizes.

450
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,255
Four. See?

451
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:43,856
That is impressive.

452
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,892
I mean, how many does he have?

453
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:47,360
Only three.

454
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,729
Well, there you go.

455
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,066
Hey, uh, listen, Honey,
while I've got you,

456
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:56,169
do you have any idea
what kind of difficult stuff

457
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,403
Zoey's been going through?

458
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:59,272
Oh, I can't tell you about that.

459
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,474
The only people
that are allowed to know

460
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:04,711
are me, Zoey and her therapist.

461
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,714
I am her therapist.

462
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:10,783
Oh! Well, in that case...

463
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:17,757
Uh, okay, listen, I think we've
made great progress for today.

464
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:20,109
I got to go. Bye.

465
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:22,729
Mom! Marcus!

466
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,096
(knocking at door)

467
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,300
What's this really about?

468
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,002
I told you.

469
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,403
Lily hates you.

470
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:31,471
I think you hate me.

471
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,373
I think you have
some big problem with me,

472
00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:35,742
and you're too chicken
to come out and say it.

473
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,544
All right.

474
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,847
Yes.

475
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,683
I... hate you.

476
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,652
Great.

477
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,887
See?

478
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:49,422
Was that so hard?

479
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,461
Zoey.

480
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:56,962
Can you at least tell me why?

481
00:17:56,963 --> 00:17:58,631
Because I'm racking
my brain here,

482
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,132
and I thought...

483
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,367
(sighs)

484
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:04,003
I just want to know why.

485
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:08,641
So we got Ted and Zoey.
Ted is in love with Zoey.

486
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:09,842
Zoey has no idea.

487
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:12,612
Then Zoey's cousin Honey
went home with Barney,

488
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:13,913
and Zoey was happy about it.

489
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:15,081
Which tells us what?

490
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,783
Zoey's in love with...

491
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,651
Zoey's in love with Ted
and Ted doesn't know.

492
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:20,620
So Ted and Zoey--
they're in love with each other,

493
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:22,622
which would be fine
if Zoey wasn't

494
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:23,923
married to Colonel Mustard.

495
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:25,324
I mean, The Captain.

496
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,762
Except now,
as Honey informs me...

497
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:30,930
And we miss you.

498
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:32,298
But the cousin thing mostly.

499
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:33,433
Let's get that going.

500
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:36,168
Fine, I will, uh,
make it happen.

501
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:38,838
Good-bye.

502
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:42,141
Okay. Well...

503
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:44,677
I guess I'll take it.

504
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:53,586
Zoey and The Captain
are getting divorced.

505
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,055
Which means...?

506
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,924
So help me, Marshall,

507
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:02,428
if you don't call those two
crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.

508
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,397
Give me that phone.

509
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,366
Why do I hate you?

510
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,534
Are you kidding?

511
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,336
Uh, you're actively trying
to prevent me

512
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,571
from realizing a lifelong dream.

513
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,805
So there's that.

514
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:13,673
Plus, you're stubborn

515
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,441
and-and-and argumentative.

516
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:19,312
And what kind of name
is Zoey, huh?

517
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:21,080
What is that, short for Zoseph?

518
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,082
(cell phone ringing)
Go on, get it.

519
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,434
I'll have more in a second.

520
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,687
Hello.

521
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,772
Oh, hey, Marshall.

522
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,694
Yes, I am.

523
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,097
Yes, I am.

524
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,801
He is?

525
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:46,873
Bye.

526
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,474
Why was Marshall calling?

527
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,076
Don't worry about it.
Go on.

528
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,345
You talk during movies.

529
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,346
You-You-You

530
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:55,281
sneeze with your whole body.

531
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:56,415
Uh, to my knowledge,

532
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,684
you do not speak Portuguese.

533
00:19:58,685 --> 00:19:59,852
Well, actually...

534
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:02,255
(speaking Portuguese)

535
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,440
You're a show-off.

536
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,993
(cell phone ringing)

537
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:09,428
You better take that.

538
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:15,034
Uh, hey, Marshall,
can I call you back?

539
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:17,303
I'm out in the hallway with...

540
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,906
