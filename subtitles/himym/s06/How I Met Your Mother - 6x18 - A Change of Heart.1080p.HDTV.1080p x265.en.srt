1
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:03,336
<i>Kids, the heart is
a mysterious muscle.</i>

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,172
<i>You never know
what's going on in there.</i>

3
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:09,678
<i>So after Uncle Marshall lost his father,
he decided to get his heart checked.</i>

4
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:11,334
<i>And so did I...</i>

5
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:13,110
<i>and so did Lily...</i>

6
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:14,956
<i>and so did Robin.</i>

7
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:17,684
<i>And then Marshall went again.</i>

8
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:19,660
<i>Just to be sure.</i>

9
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,271
<i>There was only one holdout.</i>

10
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:23,148
I don't need to go to a heart doctor.

11
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:26,621
I drink every day,
I sleep three hours every night,

12
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:29,426
and I have multiple sex partners,
I'm doing everything right.

13
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,439
Barney, come on, this is important.

14
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,152
We need you around for a long time.

15
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:36,828
Without you, we'd have to find an other
sex-fueled animal to entertain us.

16
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,581
Actually, I'm thinking about
getting a dog again.

17
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,206
Oh, can she?
Can she get a dog, please Dad?

18
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:45,420
If you get a dog, I'm going to be
the one stuck taking care of it.

19
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:48,888
- You wouldn't have to take care of it.
- And who watered the philodendron

20
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:51,218
on your bookcase
and sang it back to life?

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,497
That was made out of silk, Ted.

22
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:56,945
What you need is
indeed something that buries a bone,

23
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,476
but I'm not talking about a dog,
I'm talking about a man.

24
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,519
Here we go.

25
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,704
You're clearly trying to
fill a hole in her heart.

26
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,165
You feel like the seventh wheel,
because now Ted is with Zoey

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,318
and Barney's with Nora
and Lily's with Big Fudge.

28
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:12,092
Big Fudge.

29
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,325
"With"?

30
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,667
I am not "with" Nora.

31
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,077
Wrong preposition.

32
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,538
Later tonight I'm hoping
to be "on" Nora, right?

33
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,055
Or "under" Nora, right?

34
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,297
Or, we're all adults,
I'll just say it...

35
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:26,086
"behind" Nora.

36
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:29,297
I don't know.
This will be your second date.

37
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:32,467
Barney's got feeling for a girl.

38
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,554
Yeah. Penis feelings.
Because she's hot.

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,847
Guys, as you know,

40
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,699
I only have one rule...

41
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:40,058
<i>Barney said this a lot.</i>

42
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,060
I only have one rule.

43
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,625
If you're gonna get it
on in a Port-O-Potty,

44
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,304
do it early in the day.

45
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:48,024
I only have one rule.

46
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,626
Never screw over a girl
whose last name ends in a vowel.

47
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:53,595
'Cause she's got brothers.

48
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,157
I only have one rule.

49
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,751
Never date a girl
with a hook for a hand.

50
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,496
Never go out
with the same girl more than once.

51
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,877
Then why are you going
out with Nora again?

52
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,679
There is an exception.

53
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:10,672
<i>And it was always the same exception.</i>

54
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,133
Unless she's hot.

55
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:15,052
Unless she's hot.

56
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,851
Unless she's hot.

57
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,263
And she is indeed hot.

58
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:25,305
Which is why nothing,
not even God himself...

59
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,067
yeah, I said it, Beardy,

60
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:30,819
is going to stand in the way
of tonight being legend...

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,500
Wait for it.

67
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,214
Nora, sorry I'm late.

68
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,090
I'm just getting over a cold.

69
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,801
How long have you been sick?

70
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,053
About 20 minutes.
Can't seem to shake it.

71
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,888
I was going to say
you look a little...

72
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:00,895
Handsome?

73
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,859
Rich?

74
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:03,040
Well-endowed?

75
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:09,439
Let's say well-endowed...
with phlegm.

76
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,860
All right, let's go. It's bedtime.

77
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,027
The bed...

78
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,510
that's where all the...

79
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:21,247
happens.

80
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,036
Let's get you sorted out.

81
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,941
<i>That night, Barney didn't
take care of business.</i>

82
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,856
<i>Instead, Nora took care of Barney.</i>

83
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,458
- Good night, Barney.
- Good night, Mommy.

84
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,563
She nursed you back to health?

85
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,898
I didn't even see her boobs.

86
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,971
She just took care of me.

87
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,274
Hey, guys. This is Nate.
Nate, these are my friends.

88
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,866
What's up?
Nate Scooberman.

89
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,428
But everyone calls me Scooby.

90
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,786
I'd love to hang out,
but I really gotta hit the john.

91
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,622
Yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.

92
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:08,938
Thanks, brah.

93
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,333
I like you guys.

94
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:15,964
If you weren't so much stronger
than me, I would slap you.

95
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,939
What?

96
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:19,009
You told me to meet someone.

97
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,239
I know, and, look,
he seems plenty nice,

98
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:24,264
but I didn't mean bring home the first
guy you bump into on the street.

99
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,766
Actually, I met him in the park.

100
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,352
Should have just let you get a dog.

101
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,855
I should go.
Lily, can I talk to you for a second?

102
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:38,194
So, I made an appointment
with that cardiologist.

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,031
And you want me to go with you
'cause you're a little scared?

104
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:44,993
Do you want me to go with you
because you're a lot scared?

105
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:47,692
Okay, fine.

106
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,376
On one condition.

107
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,499
You have to promise me
you won't lie to Nora.

108
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,710
She seems like something special.

109
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:57,380
Okay, I promise I won't lie to her.

110
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,674
I may, however, lie "on" her.

111
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,188
I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.

112
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:07,832
Are we done?

113
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,564
- Barney, your heart sounds fine.
- See, Lily?

114
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,066
She was worried.

115
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:18,581
Although it seems like you might
have a slight arrhythmia.

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,033
Nails, nails!

117
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,496
It's probably nothing to worry about,

118
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:26,493
but I'd like you to wear this heart
monitor for the next 24 hours.

119
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:29,913
Flag on the play, Doc.
I have a date tonight.

120
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,498
Don't worry. It's totally safe.

121
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,834
Unless part of your big date involves
connecting yourself to a car battery.

122
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,336
Now it doesn't.

123
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,387
<i>And exactly 24 hours later,
they returned for the results.</i>

124
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,035
Everything looks fine here,

125
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,803
although I did notice
a few irregularities.

126
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:49,474
There's nothing to be...

127
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:52,894
alarmed about.

128
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,301
Go on, Doctor.

129
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:58,531
What happened
at 8:46 p.m. last night?

130
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,041
Well, let's see...

131
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:04,471
<i>Wheel of Fortune</i>, naked push-ups,
naked chin-ups...

132
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,573
I was at dinner.

133
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:08,076
This might be a little forward,

134
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,620
but do you have a bomb
strapped to your chest?

135
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:12,179
This?
No, no.

136
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:14,067
It's a heart monitor.

137
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,158
It's a medical thing.

138
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,879
I'm so sorry. I've been trying
not to stare at your chest all night.

139
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,620
What's that like?

140
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,967
So is everything okay?

141
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:27,928
My friend's dad passed away
from a sudden heart attack.

142
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,931
So I'm just getting
myself checked out, too.

143
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,891
Oh, I am so sorry.

144
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:40,007
Barney, what I'm about to say

145
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,867
is going to sound a little weird,

146
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,447
but I think I'm starting to like you,
so I have to say it.

147
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,251
For what it's worth,
I'm not easily shocked.

148
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:50,785
Unless you dump water on me,
'cause I'll just...

149
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,079
What is it?

150
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:55,318
I want to get married.

151
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,585
I mean, not tonight,
or even to you, necessarily.

152
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:00,494
But that's what I want.

153
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:04,424
And if that's going to scare you off,
then I'd rather it scare you off now.

154
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,440
I want a family,
and I want to live in a little house

155
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,280
with a garden and a tree
for the kids to climb.

156
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:15,286
And I want to go to sleep every night
with the same person by my side,

157
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,033
and wake up next to him
in the morning every morning

158
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:19,958
for the rest of our lives.

159
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:23,484
Just thought you should know that.

160
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,030
You have to promise me
you won't lie to Nora!

161
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:32,327
That's exactly what I want, too.

162
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,840
I love gardening, but these squirrels
keep messing with my tomatoes.

163
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:44,444
Every time I see them in the backyard,
I'm like, "get out of here!"

164
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,522
They run off, but sure enough,
a few minutes later, they're back.

165
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:49,226
And I'm like, "get out of here!"

166
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,511
So annoying.

167
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,298
I smell food.
Does this place have a kitchen?

168
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:58,400
Okay, but...

169
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,647
you have to admit
that he is a lot of fun.

170
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,358
I actually think
he's quite intelligent for what he is.

171
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,297
- And what is he?
- He's a dog.

172
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:09,279
- He's totally a dog.
- You saw him hitting on someone?

173
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,069
No, I didn't say, "He a dawg."

174
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:13,896
I said, "He's a dog."
As in, a dog.

175
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:16,627
I think we've all noticed
a few curious mannerisms.

176
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:19,957
Or rather, doggerisms.

177
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,469
The tag's still on your jeans.

178
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:24,394
Where?

179
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:34,847
You ready?

180
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,922
Good boy!

181
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:41,103
Good job!

182
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,528
That last one did not happen.

183
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,065
Right, he dropped it.

184
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:46,900
He's not a dog.

185
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,009
Robin, it's fine.
You wanted a dog, you got one.

186
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:52,364
And the best part is,
he got his shots.

187
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,907
Got my shots.

188
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,368
- You are so playful.
- Nice job fetching those.

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,246
Guys, cut it out.
Scooby, sit.

190
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:01,582
So, Scooby,

191
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,410
if you're going to hang out
with Robin,

192
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:04,918
you should be properly vetted.

193
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,089
We hope our nosiness
doesn't give you "paws."

194
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,947
How did you meet?
Tell us the "tail".

195
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:13,923
- How did you "whisker" off her feet?
- Shed a little light on the matter.

196
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,305
Did you send her an e-mail,
or did you "collar"?

197
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,639
Stop hounding him.

198
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:19,933
Oh, geez.

199
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,664
You're right.
We don't want your new guy to "flea."

200
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,521
We're trying to make sure
he's not a heel.

201
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,373
So, moving from Canada,

202
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,484
that transition
must have been pretty "ruff."

203
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,278
Sure was. My part of Canada's
pretty different from New York.

204
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,900
I bet it was an <i>Incredible Journey</i>

205
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,491
- What part of Canada is that? Speak.
- Labrador.

206
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,692
This isn't happening.

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,169
Why don't you go play
some music on the jukebox.

208
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:43,178
No, I'm good.

209
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:45,566
- Shoot, dropped my keys.
- I'll get 'em.

210
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:49,772
Guys, this is Nora.

211
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,466
Nice to meet you.

212
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,822
We were just passing by,

213
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:55,690
and I wanted to pop in
for two reasons.

214
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:56,975
First, to let you know

215
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,972
that your friend
is being a perfect gentleman.

216
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:01,593
- It's still early.
- I'm being serious.

217
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:04,467
I had no idea that deep down,
he's such a romantic.

218
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,897
I had no idea he had a deep down.

219
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,649
You should have heard him at dinner.

220
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,568
I like being single,

221
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:13,332
but secretly,

222
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,155
I want to have kids.

223
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,339
How many?

224
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,033
Three... one of each.

225
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:19,534
You?

226
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,502
Three.

227
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,331
All in an old stone house.

228
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,997
With ivy growing on it.

229
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,499
Cocktails on the patio.

230
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,167
And we must have a pool.

231
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,627
We?

232
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,838
A pool sounds brilliant.

233
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:34,925
Are you for real, Barney?

234
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:37,010
I really am.

235
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:39,888
Unbelievable.

236
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:40,927
I know.

237
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,906
And the second reason we popped in
is 'cause I need to use the loo.

238
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,374
But when I get back,

239
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,807
I'm dying to hear all
about Mr. Softy here.

240
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:50,722
That's not a nickname that I...

241
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,131
And that explains
your 14-second cardiac arrest.

242
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:00,200
You promised you wouldn't lie.

243
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,453
I'm not lying.

244
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,454
Nora's really special.

245
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,539
In fact...

246
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,767
I think I'm...

247
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:08,792
falling in love with her.

248
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:14,522
I'm serious.

249
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,922
I'll stop you.

250
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,051
When Nora gets back here,
I'm blowing the whistle.

251
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,358
Make sure
it's not a high-frequency whistle,

252
00:11:20,483 --> 00:11:22,097
we don't want to torture Scooby.

253
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,263
This is real.

254
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:27,408
And if you don't make me
look good in front of Nora,

255
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,690
remember
I've got dirt on each of you,

256
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,231
and I am not afraid to spill it.

257
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,234
Barney, you can't blackmail us
into lying to Nora.

258
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,463
Really?

259
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:38,280
Even if I were to mention,
I don't know...

260
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,490
your kindergarten class's
pet guinea pig?

261
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:42,114
Mr. Buttons?

262
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,147
You son of a bitch.

263
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:46,204
Fine. I'll be nice.

264
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,248
- Marshall?
- You got nothing on me.

265
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,859
- The calzone?
- Checkmate.

266
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:54,517
Don't say the Mr. T dream,
don't say the Mr. T dream,

267
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:56,923
The Mr. T dream...

268
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:01,914
Go ahead. Give me your best.

269
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,221
My life's an open book.

270
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,431
The ballet class.

271
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,767
I once took a ballet class.
Not ashamed.

272
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,518
The 'N Sync concert.

273
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,009
1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena,
front row.

274
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,773
Caught JC's shirt.
What else you got?

275
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,276
The thermos.

276
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:19,308
I suppose it's possible
Barney has real feelings for Nora.

277
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,372
I do!

278
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:21,907
So be cool!

279
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,455
There's a man who seems fascinated
by the records flipping in the jukebox.

280
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,875
Sorry, toots.
He's taken.

281
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,581
- So. How do you all know Barney?
- I don't know how we know Barney.

282
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:38,155
How does anyone know
how they know anyone?

283
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,967
I like your pretty hair, help me.

284
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,452
We did not meet him at a strip club.

285
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,385
No, sir.
Because...

286
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,358
Barney don't go to no strip clubs.

287
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,646
Come on. Barney's been
to a strip club once.

288
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,855
- Once?
- Thermos.

289
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,232
Nope. Not even once.

290
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,650
Really?

291
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:58,069
So Barney really is
a genuinely a nice guy.

292
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,020
I don't recall.

293
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:06,864
I think that we're done here,

294
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:09,497
I think that we have adequately
established that Barney is

295
00:13:10,596 --> 00:13:13,475
the kind of guy that you would
bring home to meet your parents.

296
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,503
Okay? So...
let's just drop it, all right?

297
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,491
It's funny you should say that, because,
as it happens, my parents are in town.

298
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:22,844
They're only here like once a year.
We're getting brunch tomorrow.

299
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,345
Do you want to meet them?

300
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,431
<i>This was a big deal for Barney.</i>

301
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,755
I only have one rule.

302
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:33,229
Never, ever, ever
meet a girl's parents.

303
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:35,940
Not even if she's hot?

304
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,026
Not even if her mom's hot.

305
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,361
I'd love to meet your parents.

306
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,197
It's a date.

307
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,200
We should get going.
Walk me home?

308
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,661
Walk? Somebody say walk?
I love a good walk.

309
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:51,914
No, Scooby, you stay!

310
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,587
I got called back in to work.

311
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,090
Can you keep an eye
on him until I get back?

312
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,792
He's new to the city,
and he doesn't really know anyone.

313
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:07,013
I knew it. I knew if you got a dog,
I'd wind up taking care of it.

314
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:09,803
Good night.

315
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,600
What do we do now?

316
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,775
I got an idea. I was in the park today,
and this guy sold me a big bag of...

317
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,690
<i>Kids,
it was a big bag of sandwiches.</i>

318
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,823
- Put that away.
- Wanna fire these up?

319
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:29,368
Scooby, we're in our 30s.
We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.

320
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,412
- Sandwich brownies?
- Okay.

321
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,495
Sandwiches make me hungry.

322
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,621
Truth.

323
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,443
I have a question.

324
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,909
What did Barney mean when he said

325
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,299
"calzone"?

326
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:46,431
Okay, I'll tell you.

327
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:50,845
One time Barney saw me
drop a calzone on the sidewalk,

328
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,945
pick it up, and then keep eating it.

329
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,402
It feels so good
to finally say that out loud. I...

330
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,022
Dude.
Listen to me.

331
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:00,941
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

332
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,152
That calzone sounds amazing.

333
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,117
Guys, I found this on the floor.

334
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,829
Scooby ate the whole tray.

335
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:17,987
Wait. Where is he, anyway?

336
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,793
Dude.

337
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,504
Scooby got out!

338
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,883
Here we are.

339
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,555
I had a really great time tonight.

340
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,921
Yeah, me, too.

341
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:41,023
Do you wanna come upstairs?

342
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,417
I'd love to.

343
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,157
There's just one little thing,
and it probably doesn't matter, but...

344
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,287
I don't wanna get married. I've been
saying that to get in your pants.

345
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,085
Can you believe...

346
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,541
I found Scooby's wallet.

347
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,973
That means the poor guy's
out there with no identification.

348
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,935
Remember Scooby?
Well, he got out.

349
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:19,228
What do you mean?

350
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:22,340
He just walked out of the apartment.
Someone must've left the door open.

351
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,260
- It wasn't me.
- Me neither.

352
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:27,403
He must've figured out
how to open it himself.

353
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:30,615
He's so smart. We should get him
on Letterman doing tricks.

354
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,701
I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy.
This could happen.

355
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,025
Guys, get yourselves together
and start looking for Scooby.

356
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,873
- I'm on my way home.
- Wait wait!

357
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:41,167
Can you pick up some calzones?

358
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,150
Nora, wait. Wait.

359
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:47,506
I'm sorry I misled you.

360
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:48,673
Misled?

361
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,218
You lied to me!
You had your friends lie to me!

362
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:54,513
- I was on the spot. This is your fault.
- My fault?

363
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,641
With the whole
"I wanna get married" thing.

364
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,064
You can't just tell someone exactly
what you want out of a relationship.

365
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:03,792
This... isn't England.

366
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,969
- Great idea.
- No, great idea!

367
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:17,388
If you were new in town

368
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:20,122
and had just ingested an eighth
of sandwich, where would you go?

369
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,971
Of course.

370
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:24,669
Back to the pizza place!

371
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,630
- Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.
- Who's Scooby?

372
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,132
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, have you seen Scooby?

373
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,802
Isn't him taking a leak
on that fire hydrant?

374
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,100
It's my friends!

375
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,274
And that explains 12:51 a.m.

376
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:47,316
Okay. None of this suggests
a systemic issue.

377
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,798
Your heart's fine.

378
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:51,445
With a healthy diet,
you can live a long and happy life.

379
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:53,280
If nobody stabs you.

380
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:54,949
Day's not over.

381
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,080
I'm sorry that I lied
about wanting to settle down.

382
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:03,066
No, that wasn't the lie.

383
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:06,046
The lie was when you told Nora
you were lying.

384
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,504
Because you weren't.

385
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,880
You want that stuff, Barney,
I know you do.

386
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:15,720
Maybe, eventually,
I could settle down.

387
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,053
50 years from now,

388
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:20,975
if I have like a Hefner thing going on
with some really hot twins.

389
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,601
But those twins

390
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:25,341
won't even be born for another...

391
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,440
32 years.

392
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,410
I mean...

393
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,653
Nora's great.
She's wonderful. But...

394
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,157
- What time was your dinner reservation?
- Last night? 8:30.

395
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,451
What did his heart do at 8:30?

396
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:52,380
It... literally skipped a beat.

397
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:58,095
Your heart's talking to you, Barney.
Do you have the guts to listen to it?

398
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:20,284
I lied.

399
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,662
When I said I lied,
that was a lie, and I'm sorry.

400
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,706
- I'm confused.
- So am I.

401
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:29,756
This, all of this,
this is totally new to me, but,

402
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:33,274
I know it's what I want.
I want to be confused.

403
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,507
With you.

404
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:41,873
Mom, Dad...

405
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:44,019
This is Barney.

406
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:47,728
I'm Barney.
Great to meet you.

407
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:49,730
You wanna see a magic trick?
