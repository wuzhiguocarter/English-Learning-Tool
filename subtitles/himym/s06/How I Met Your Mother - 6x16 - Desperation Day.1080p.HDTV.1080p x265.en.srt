1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:03,844
<i>My first kiss with Zoey was amazing,</i>

2
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:05,523
<i>and complicated.</i>

3
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:06,648
Look...

4
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:09,371
I know you're going
through a lot right now.

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,548
Getting divorced, being single,

6
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:14,054
figuring out
who you are on your own.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,014
Someone knows how to set a mood.

8
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,533
I just mean...

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,250
I'm okay taking this slow.

10
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:22,937
I wanna do this right.

11
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,316
<i>My friends, as usual,
were completely supportive.</i>

12
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,151
You're doing this all wrong!

13
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,627
Ted, there are couples
in my kindergarten class

14
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:32,696
who have moved faster than you two.

15
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,222
Granted, their home lives
are not great.

16
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:37,970
I'm trying. I keep suggesting
these big, romantic dates,

17
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:39,770
and she keeps putting on the brakes.

18
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:42,957
Like tonight, she wants me to just
come over and bake cookies.

19
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:45,713
Translation: booty-call.

20
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,170
Total booty-call.

21
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,538
Private Booty, reporting for duty.

22
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:51,841
That's crazy.
She wants to bake.

23
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,609
Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 am
with a drunkenly slurred,

24
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,397
"What ya doing?"

25
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,856
But when a lady booty-calls a guy,

26
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,499
she invents a respectable excuse

27
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:05,324
to mask the fact that she wants
to get stuck real good.

28
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,731
It's called class, Ted.

29
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:08,269
Wait. That...

30
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:10,610
You think that's what she means
by "baking cookies"?

31
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:11,778
Are you kidding?

32
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,698
You're in the kitchen,
it's getting hot,

33
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,409
you start licking stuff
off each others' fingers.

34
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,910
Before you know it,

35
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,770
she's bent over the marble island,

36
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:22,920
and you're spanking her
with a rubber spatula.

37
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,014
And she's screaming,
"Stop, Marshall, stop,"

38
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,824
but that's just code for "harder!"

39
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:30,588
Marshall's been in Minnesota
a while, huh?

40
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:32,027
So long!

41
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:34,551
And now he's staying even longer.

42
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,522
His mom has been having
a really hard time since the funeral.

43
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,264
He's waiting on her hand and foot.

44
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,699
But it's Valentine's Day.
It's not gonna be the same

45
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,937
without the two of us
watching <i>Predator</i> together.

46
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:47,981
<i>I should explain.
On their very first Valentine's Day,</i>

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,202
<i>Marshall and Lily set out
to watch </i>Sleepless in Seattle.

48
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:55,113
You know, I saw this in
the theater, like, five times,

49
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,741
but I never got to see it
with the right girl.

50
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:02,662
I'm so glad none of those girls
were right for you.

51
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,880
What girls?

52
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,386
<i>If it bleeds, we can kill it.</i>

53
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,930
<i>Except Marshall's brothers
had taped over it with</i> Predator.

54
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:13,886
<i>And it became a tradition.</i>

55
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,676
You sound really lonely.

56
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:17,844
I am.

57
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,138
Earlier today, I burst into tears...

58
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,806
Daddy's talking now.

59
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,141
Loneliness.

60
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:26,853
The looming specter
of Valentine's Day fast approaching.

61
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:30,763
The two key ingredients
to my favorite day of the year,

62
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:32,490
February 13:

63
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:34,138
Desperation Day.

64
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,236
- That's not a thing.
- It's a thing.

65
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,125
Much like Valentine's Day itself,

66
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,366
Desperation Day dates
back thousands of years.

67
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:43,531
<i>Weddings were forbidden
under ancient Roman law,</i>

68
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:46,133
<i>so Saint Valentine
performed them in secret,</i>

69
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:47,874
<i>under threat of death.</i>

70
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,959
- That's actually true.
- Wait, there's more.

71
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,252
This won't be.

72
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,944
<i>And right by Saint Valentine's side
was his best bro,</i>

73
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,699
<i>Saint Desperatius,</i>

74
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,391
<i>there to pick off
insecure bridesmaids.</i>

75
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:00,637
Check out that one.

76
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,714
Her body is a perfect X.

77
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,945
Player, play on.
High V.

78
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,312
Oh, Jupiter,

79
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,330
what are your plans for me?

80
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,398
15 and still unmarried.

81
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,536
And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.

82
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:23,226
Every woman wants a date
on Valentine's Day.

83
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,659
That neediness reaches its climax...
what up... on February 13.

84
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:29,473
A magical night

85
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,489
when a ten
has the self-esteem of a four

86
00:03:32,614 --> 00:03:34,838
and the depraved
enthusiasm of a two.

87
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,796
Now, there's only one
thing you can't do.

88
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,376
Please say "widows."

89
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:42,330
Wherever you are,
or whoever you're under,

90
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,064
you must get home alone

91
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:47,082
by 11:59 pm.

92
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:50,395
Otherwise, you're on a
date on Valentine's Day.

93
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,771
Barney, Desperation Day

94
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:55,162
assumes that all single women
freak out about Valentine's Day.

95
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:56,442
Which we do not.

96
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,569
Case in point,

97
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,688
I will be spending February 13 with
some lovely single ladies from work...

98
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:03,356
- Trolls.
- ... who could care less

99
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,331
- about Valentine's Day.
- Lying trolls.

100
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:08,147
And we will be celebrating the fact
that we don't have to spend it

101
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:11,190
with some dippy guy carting around
roses and stuffed toys all night.

102
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:12,333
No offense, Ted.

103
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:15,188
And none was taken until just then.

6x16 - Desperation Day (1.00)
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

108
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:30,643
I decided to go to Minnesota

109
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,111
to see Marshall.

110
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:36,190
He shouldn't have to help his mom
through this rough time all by himself.

111
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:39,110
- You losing your mind, being alone?
- I'm getting weird!

112
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,847
<i>See, it started off with me throwing
Marshall's jersey on my body pillow.</i>

113
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:44,972
<i>And, well,</i>

114
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:47,956
<i>things kind of spiraled from there.</i>

115
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm sorry I yelled like that before.

116
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:56,547
I call him "Marshpillow."
And he calls me...

117
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,588
Nothing because he's a pillow.

118
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,507
How was "baking cookies" last night?

119
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,638
<i>That was a tough question.
You see...</i>

120
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,853
Is that an overnight bag?

121
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,777
- You brought an overnight bag?
- You said I was gonna spend the night.

122
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,655
We said you were gonna have sex.
We didn't say, "Bring a carry-on."

123
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:25,657
So how did Zoey react?

124
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,326
She thought it was presumptuous
and asked me to leave.

125
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,205
- I didn't brought a ton of stuff.
- Were there slippers for the morning?

126
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:36,042
Not slippers, exactly.

127
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,587
They're called
British morning socks.

128
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:45,604
This is such a nice surprise.
Marshall will be so happy.

129
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,305
How are you holding up, Judy?

130
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:51,980
I'm doin' okay.
It gets a little lonely.

131
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,987
My friends suggested
a body pillow, but...

132
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:56,771
I'm not a lunatic.

133
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,629
I hate to be that guy,
but I'm pretty sure

134
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:03,445
it was Hot Pocket o'clock,
like, ten minutes ago.

135
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,825
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to surprise you.

136
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,576
My gosh, that's so sweet.

137
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,453
I'm so glad you're here.

138
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:15,832
Before I forget, Mom, did you remember
to get more double-A batteries?

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,668
They're upstairs, sweetie. Right next
to your washed and folded clothes.

140
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,995
Great, okay. I don't want
my Game Boy to crap out.

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,252
I'm having the sickest
Dr. Mario run of my life.

142
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,591
I'll be right back.
I love you, Lily.

143
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:28,465
You're the best, Mom.

144
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,424
Anything for my baby bear.

145
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,725
Get him out of my house.

146
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,897
Take Marshall back
to New York with you.

147
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,066
Please, I am begging you.

148
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,735
I thought he was here helping you.

149
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,054
He was, at first.

150
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,019
But once he saw me starting
to do better, he kind of regressed.

151
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:50,808
He's been holed up in his room
for days at a time,

152
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,264
playing old video games.

153
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,496
I mean, he is having a pretty
sick Dr. Mario run, but...

154
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,709
- I'll talk to him.
- I wanna be there for him,

155
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,438
but it's like he's a teenager again.

156
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,756
I even walked in
on him abusing himself.

157
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,707
There he was, on the bed,
looking at old photos of his dad.

158
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:11,846
That's emotional self-abuse,
don't you think?

159
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,646
Listen, that was a dumb move
for me to just assume...

160
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,572
I overreacted. I mean,

161
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:25,657
I invited you over to
"bake cookies."

162
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:28,154
- We both knew what that meant.
- We totally did.

163
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:31,616
I just, you know...
I saw those slippers in your bag,

164
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:35,313
and suddenly everything
felt really serious. And...

165
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,088
ever since, I've been asking myself,

166
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,249
"Am I ready for this?"

167
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:41,834
And...

168
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,046
the answer is "yes."

169
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,220
- They're British morning socks.
- Don't get in your own way.

170
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,867
Marshall, your mom asked me
to carry this up.

171
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:00,019
She turned her ankle
on your Hot Wheels.

172
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:01,479
Is my track okay?

173
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:04,107
It's fine, but, Marshall,

174
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:07,030
I thought you were here
taking care of your mom.

175
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,153
It seems like
she's taking care of you.

176
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,240
My mom loves to feel needed.

177
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:15,701
Letting her take care of me
is how I'm taking care of her.

178
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,455
She's in a dark place, Lily.
She needs this.

179
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,258
You forgot my chocolate milk
with the swirly straw!

180
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:26,631
Comin' right up!

181
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,826
She needs this.

182
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:34,101
Tomorrow's Valentine's.

183
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:36,466
Don't you wanna be at home
on our couch,

184
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,711
cuddling up under a warm blanket,

185
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:40,943
watching the Predator
use his heat vision

186
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:43,020
to stalk helpless prey?

187
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,205
Well, baby,
we could watch <i>Predator</i> here.

188
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:04,876
My mom can go rent it for us
after she's done digging out the car.

189
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,128
- Your mom wants you out of here.
- What?

190
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,005
Anything else, sweetie?

191
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,757
Do you want me to leave?

192
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,963
Heavens to Bess, no!

193
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,636
Of course not!

194
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:19,360
- But, Judy, you said...
- If Marshall could stay here forever,

195
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:22,675
I would be the happiest
mom in Minnesota.

196
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,106
<i>Get him out!</i>

197
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,960
So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

198
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,071
You know, there's
this new Italian restaurant

199
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,030
on 79th that's
supposed to be amazing.

200
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,586
I would be happier having
just a simple, home-cooked meal.

201
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,076
As long as it's with you.

202
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:41,329
Tomorrow night, my place.

203
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,084
I'm ready for this, Ted.

204
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,670
I am in it for the long haul.

205
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:54,086
I can't wait for our first
Valentine's Day as a couple.

206
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,736
The one we'll remember for years.

207
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,390
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah, if you say so.

208
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:03,204
What do you mean?

209
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:06,261
She just got out of a marriage, Ted.
That's heavy.

210
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,773
I'm kind of freaking out,
just listening to you.

211
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,109
My heart is pounding,
I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.

212
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,885
Well, it's romantic, right?

213
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,118
Zoey and I are getting serious
on Valentine's Day.

214
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:24,128
See, that just amps up
the pressure even more.

215
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:26,165
Boy, it's a good thing
that you're sure.

216
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,983
Who said I wasn't sure?

217
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,462
I'm glad we're
in a serious relationship.

218
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:31,587
Right away.

219
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,135
And if I screw this up,
I'm the devil,

220
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,251
because she's going through a divorce.
But I'm not gonna screw this up.

221
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,227
So stop freaking out.

222
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,513
Stop freaking out!

223
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:44,183
<i>Kids, I'm not super proud
of what I did next.</i>

224
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,444
I'm here to help Marshall.

225
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:53,025
<i>Meanwhile, as Desperation Day
turned into Desperation Night...</i>

226
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:56,737
God, these girls are so hungry
for male attention.

227
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,208
It is like being a hunter

228
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:03,137
and having the deer walk up,
tie itself to the hood of your car

229
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,870
and beg to get mounted.

230
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,469
This is Bev and Anna,
my coworkers and my friends.

231
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:13,462
Bev, Anna, this is Barney,
a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.

232
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,641
<i>Enchanté.</i>

233
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,812
That's French for
"What's with the purple?"

234
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:20,928
Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day,
and everything is pink and red, so Bev

235
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,221
very thoughtfully

236
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,266
suggested that we wear purple
to show how little we care.

237
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,806
I use colors to express emotion.

238
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,431
Purple is for pride.

239
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,855
It was a stupid idea.

240
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,212
Bev, you look at me.

241
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:35,200
It's not a stupid idea.

242
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:37,232
Tonight, we are queens.

243
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,873
And we don't care about some stupid,
sexist, corporate holiday.

244
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:42,998
Please!

245
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:47,251
You might as well be dog-earing
a tear-stained bridal magazine

246
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:50,624
while wolfing down the box of chocolates
you had delivered to yourself at work

247
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,960
from your "fiancé"
who no one's ever met.

248
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:54,378
Gerard is real!

249
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,223
I thought you were gonna talk to
Marshall about coming back to New York.

250
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,688
Yeah, but, you know,
things move so fast in New York.

251
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:11,764
Why not hang out here until
at least after Valentine's Day?

252
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,564
Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom.

253
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,273
Mrs. Eriksen,
we're running low on SunnyD!

254
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:18,257
<i>Is orange juice okay?</i>

255
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,805
When your "fiancé" Gerard comes back

256
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,969
from fixing cleft palates in Peru,

257
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,189
maybe snatch a photo
of the two of you together,

258
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:30,915
and then I'll totally believe you.

259
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:34,371
Well, he's going to
Kenya after Peru, so...

260
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,879
Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.

261
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,585
This is Barney.
You wanna see Anna

262
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,718
- beat him in an arm wrestle?
- My elbow slipped!

263
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:47,098
Marshall, I'm going home.

264
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:51,821
What?

265
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:55,189
I'm flying out tonight
before the big storm,

266
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,316
and I want you to come with me.

267
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:02,029
I can't right now,
'cause my mom needs me.

268
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:06,254
While I'm sure it's been really
helpful for her to have you here

269
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:09,286
playing <i>Super Mario Kart</i>
for 14 hours a day...

270
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,699
- You have <i>Super Mario Kart</i>?!
- Hell, yeah.

271
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,368
But your mom doesn't need you.

272
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,593
Your life in New York needs you.

273
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,922
It needs you really bad.

274
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,758
Baby, don't go.

275
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,630
Please come home soon.

276
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,399
- So, you were an Olympic gymnast?
- Silver medal.

277
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,777
Sorry. Gold's the only thing
that really counts.

278
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:43,237
That's what my dad said.

279
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,822
And she sticks the landing.

280
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:47,616
Why don't you start
stretching, and I'll...

281
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,481
be right back.

282
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,070
Sorry. Quick question.

283
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,535
Why aren't you wearing purple?

284
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,835
I told them I forgot, but the truth is,
I'm kind of protesting their protest.

285
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,504
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

286
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,322
I love Valentine's Day.

287
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,717
My gosh! Me, too!

288
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,804
Is it getting crowded in here, 'cause
I think there are two peas in this pod?

289
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,515
- You're a gooey romantic, too?
- Guilty.

290
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,017
This is embarrassing,

291
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,438
but every year,

292
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:18,513
I buy flowers and a box of chocolates,
even if I'm not with someone.

293
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:20,853
Just in case, you know?

294
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,194
- We are pitiful.
- The worst.

295
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:26,238
Although there is
one difference between you and me.

296
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:27,241
What's that?

297
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,366
I'm not saying any of this
to get in your pants.

298
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,127
I miss my dad, Ted.

299
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,760
I miss him so much.

300
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,005
I know.

301
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:49,097
When I was a kid, we would spend
the summers in the Upper Peninsula.

302
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,987
And every year, we wouldn't get to the
cabin till the middle of the night.

303
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,518
So, it would be pitch black,

304
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:57,561
<i>in the middle of the woods.</i>

305
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,430
<i>And I could never see anything
in front of the headlights,</i>

306
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,305
<i>but I always felt so safe</i>

307
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:04,792
<i>'cause my dad was driving.</i>

308
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:07,063
<i>He was like some sort of superhero</i>

309
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,240
<i>who could just see way out
into the darkness.</i>

310
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:12,993
Now he's just gone.

311
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,504
And it's pitch black.

312
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,790
I can't see where I'm going.

313
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:21,669
I can't see anything.

314
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:25,839
All right.

315
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,568
I was playing you before.

316
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,677
But I was really doing you
a public service.

317
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:31,920
It's February 13th.

318
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:35,371
A day many are now calling
Desperation Day.

319
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:37,351
It's kind of a thing.
And you,

320
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,990
walking around,
saying you're a gooey romantic?

321
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:42,215
It comes across a bit desperate.

322
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:45,234
What's desperate
about knowing what you want?

323
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,102
Life is really short, Barney.

324
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:50,353
Who wants to spend
Valentine's Day alone,

325
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:52,850
distracting yourself from the fact
that nobody loves you

326
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,975
with some sad little activity?

327
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:59,339
Or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual
Laser Tag Tournament

328
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:00,764
in Poughkeepsie.

329
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:03,335
I have no idea
what any of those words mean.

330
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,930
I'm all stretched out!

331
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:11,093
Here's the first thing
you need to know about laser tag.

332
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,937
Thanks a lot
for coming out here, man.

333
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:19,977
Are you sure it's okay with Zoey
that you're here for Valentine's Day?

334
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,188
Well, I mean,
technically, she doesn't know yet.

335
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,378
- What?
- Things with Zoey

336
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:29,164
are moving really fast,
and the divorce just makes everything

337
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,281
more complicated. I just...
I needed to take a step back.

338
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,433
You're not taking a step back.

339
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,939
You're running away.

340
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:39,163
And hiding out here
is not gonna solve anything.

341
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,898
You're just holed up in Minnesota

342
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:44,116
because you're too scared
to face reality...

343
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,216
We gotta go back to New York,
tonight.

344
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:53,344
We're snowed in.
Lily got the last flight.

345
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,212
So, we drive. It's time.

346
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:58,091
It's time to get back to real life.

347
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,434
It's time to grow up.

348
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:06,341
Can you make us
some PB and J's for the road?

349
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,070
Crusts cut off!

350
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,653
No, Ted. What are we...

351
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,625
We're men.

352
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,689
Leave the crusts on!

353
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:28,003
They forced their opponents to scatter,
picking them off, one by one,

354
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:30,631
in a swift and merciless slaughter.

355
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:35,427
That is how Boy Scout Troop 15
became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.

356
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,469
- Laser tag sounds brilliant!
- It is.

357
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,433
Plus, if you win,
you get free pizza!

358
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,813
- This is my teammate for tomorrow.
- Yeah, I agreed to that.

359
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:47,731
Where are Bev and Anna?

360
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,193
- So, we're taking off.
- What?

361
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:54,279
Those guys are gonna buy us
hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.

362
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,198
So that's it?

363
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,966
A couple of white Urkels
offer you sausages, and you're gone?

364
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:02,058
What about the sisterhood?

365
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:04,039
Solidarity?
The color purple?

366
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,257
But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.

367
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,252
I thought we didn't care about it.

368
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,673
You'll find someone, too.

369
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,470
You're a queen.
You've got so much to offer.

370
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,217
Maybe do something with that hair.

371
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,137
I'm telling you.

372
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,255
The power of Valentine's Day.

373
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:23,183
I'm Huey Lewis,
and you just heard the news.

374
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,686
I think I'm heading out, too.

375
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,105
What? No, don't go!
You wanna see a magic trick?

376
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,386
It's late, and I have a date
with my pillow.

377
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,401
I mean, not literally.
I'm not a lunatic.

378
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,696
Boy Scout Troop 15
doesn't stand a chance.

379
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:46,498
Speaking of the power
of Valentine's Day...

380
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:49,293
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

381
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:50,998
It's past midnight.

382
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:53,399
Desperation Day has come and gone,

383
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:56,383
and you have neither gone nor come.

384
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,684
You know why?

385
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,179
You like Nora.

386
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,391
No, I don't. She's gross.

387
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,578
You like her.

388
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:05,753
You think she smells like rain.

389
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,811
Whatever you say.

390
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:21,027
Here's a secret.

391
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:25,365
I couldn't see
worth a damn, either, buddy.

392
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,500
I just kept driving forward,
hoping for the best.

393
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:32,927
Look out!

394
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:34,787
Gotcha.

395
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,419
<i>And so we drove through the night, out
of Desperation Day and into Valentine's.</i>

396
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:50,408
<i>And there was no trace
of my little freak out, except...</i>

397
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,898
Really? An overnight bag
for your own living room?

398
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,985
Looks like we got a matching set.

399
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,697
Well, that was kind of presumptuous.

400
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,292
Where are you?
Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot

401
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,083
since last year. They're terrifying!

402
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,142
Change of plans.

403
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:15,587
Happy Valentine's Day.

404
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:19,883
Robin told me to meet you guys here.

405
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,198
<i>And that's how,
for the first time in his life,</i>

406
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:25,347
<i>Barney Stinson wound up on a date
on Valentine's Day.</i>

407
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:31,895
You will be avenged.

408
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,370
<i>Come on!</i>

409
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:39,549
<i>Kill me! I'm here! Kill me!</i>

410
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:43,223
Baby!

411
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:44,604
You're back.

412
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,286
Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad.

413
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,930
We both knew
this would end eventually.

9999
