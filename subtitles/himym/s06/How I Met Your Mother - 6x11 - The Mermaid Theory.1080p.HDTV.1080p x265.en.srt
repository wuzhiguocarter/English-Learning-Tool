<i>Kids, in the winter of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,897
<i>we had a new addition
to our little group-- Zoey.</i>

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:09,366
<i>Zoey was married to...
The Captain.</i>

4
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,768
Boys! Great to see you!

5
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:12,869
Looking smart.

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,738
Have a wonderful time
tonight, okay?

7
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:17,140
Okay.

8
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:18,842
That man is terrifying.

9
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:21,344
Everything he said was nice,
but I am profoundly scared.

10
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:23,113
Keep smiling.
He can still see us.

11
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:24,347
(all murmuring)

12
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:26,283
<i>NARRATOR: There was
just something about him.</i>

13
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:29,019
<i>We couldn't put
our finger on it until...</i>

14
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,654
I figured it out!

15
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,790
I know what's so creepy
about The Captain.

16
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,724
Okay.

17
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:37,994
(all scream)
Yeah.

18
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:39,162
I snapped this
photo of him

19
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,664
last time he dropped off Zoey.

20
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,932
Observe.

21
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,034
The bottom half
of his face... is smiling.

22
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:45,702
LILY: Oh. Look,
he seems happy.

23
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,904
Seems like a nice guy.

24
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,005
(all murmur happily)

25
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,174
But the top half of his face...

26
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:51,908
(all gasp)

27
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53,109
...wants to murder you!

28
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,111
Cheerful.

29
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:56,613
(all screaming)
Wants to murder you.

30
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:58,248
No. Cheerful.

31
00:00:58,249 --> 00:00:59,983
(all scream)
Wants to murder you.

32
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:02,252
Now, hold on.
Let me ask him a question.

33
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:05,422
Captain,
what do you think of ice cream?

34
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:06,756
Oh, he loves it!

35
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:08,758
Captain, what do you
think of rainy days?

36
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:11,027
(gasps) Whoa, he hates them.

37
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,530
Captain, quick question:

38
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,398
How do you feel about
the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.

39
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:16,600
Ooh.
Ooh.

40
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:20,470
What-What is that?

41
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,172
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

42
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,941
He hates that he loves them.

43
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:26,309
(all murmur):
Ah!

Hey, guys, Zoey just told me

49
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,894
about this great Frank Lloyd
Wright retrospective tonight.

50
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,095
Who's in?

51
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:47,130
Sorry, I'm, uh, I...

52
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,932
I- I don't know,
washing my hair.

53
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:49,699
Running the water.

54
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,800
Holding the towel.

55
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:51,935
And I'll be home

56
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,203
trying to get over the fact

57
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:55,038
that no one invited me
to the big hair washing party.

58
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,340
All right, fine.
Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.

59
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:59,209
Oh, wait.
Just the two of you?

60
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,111
Tread lightly, Mosby.

61
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,045
Any time

62
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:03,346
a single guy hangs out

63
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,481
with a married woman,

64
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,283
there are rules
that must be followed.

65
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:07,951
Rule number one...

66
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,452
Don't use
the husband's condoms.

67
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,087
That's just rude.

68
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:13,657
Rule number one:

69
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:16,593
don't go anywhere
that has candles.

70
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,962
Excuse me, Captain,
how do you feel

71
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:21,998
about Ted and Zoey having
an intimate chat by candlelight?

72
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,166
Mm-hmm...

73
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:24,301
(yelling)

74
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:26,636
It'll be the last dinner
they ever have.

75
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,939
Rule number two:

76
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,373
No sharing food.
Hmm.

77
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:32,943
In fact, anything involving
saliva is off-limits.

78
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,578
Toothbrushes,
thermometers, lipstick.

79
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,746
Well, if I can't share
her lipstick,

80
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:37,881
there's really no point
in even going.

81
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:40,450
And the most
important rule of all...

82
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,119
Lubricant is public
property. (Robin groans)

83
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,853
Please.

84
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,388
No lying to the spouse

85
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,490
about anything you do.

86
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:48,625
Why would anyone lie?

87
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,759
Look, Zoey and I
are just friends.

88
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,061
If there was anything more
than that,

89
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,262
I wouldn't hang out with her.

90
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:54,164
Lily's right, Ted.
Once you're married,

91
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:55,498
it's very hard to be friends

92
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:58,034
with a single person of the
opposite sex. ROBIN: Yeah.

93
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:59,502
Unless you're old friends,
which is why

94
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,504
I can hang out
with Marshall whenever I want.

95
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:02,605
Right, Marsh Madness?

96
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:03,974
No doubt, Robo Cop.

97
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:06,743
You two never hang out alone.

98
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:08,712
You just made up those nicknames
right now.

99
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:09,980
I guess it's true.

100
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,148
You and I never really
hang out alone.

101
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,718
Well, let's. Let's have dinner
together, just the two of us.

102
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,986
Oh! Sweet.

103
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,921
No candles.

104
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,990
BOTH:
No candles.

105
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,125
Lily, I guess that leaves
just you and me. Want to hang?

106
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:24,160
<i>NARRATOR: And then Lily
said something to Barney</i>

107
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,129
<i>that insulted every fiber
of his being.</i>

108
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,564
Nah.

109
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:29,065
(gasps)

110
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,534
<i>NARRATOR: Wait. No. It had
to be more than just, "Nah."</i>

111
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:32,669
<i>Oh, I think she said...</i>

112
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,906
You're a big...
stupid octopus head!

113
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:38,108
(gasps)

114
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,542
<i>NARRATOR:
No, that doesn't make sense.</i>

115
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:42,145
<i>Okay, hang on.
What did she say?</i>

116
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:46,916
<i>She said, um, uh...</i>

117
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:49,819
<i>To be honest kids, I'm having
a little trouble remembering</i>

118
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,521
<i>exactly what their fight
was about.</i>

119
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,156
<i>Hey, it was 20 years ago!</i>

120
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:54,324
<i>I'll remember.</i>

121
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:55,759
<i>Anyway, the next night...</i>

122
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,228
Well, Lily,
you were right.

123
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,531
Something weird happened
with Zoey last night.

124
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,834
(phone plays "Anchors Aweigh")
Oh, that's the Captain.

125
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,703
Yes, I call my husband
The Captain,

126
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,906
but that is the only concession
I make to his seafaring ways.

127
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:11,341
Hang on.

128
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:12,709
Ahoy.

129
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,445
I'm just out with friends.

130
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:17,313
Friends. Plural.

131
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,549
Like-Like there was more
than one of me.

132
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,784
Ew! Ew!

133
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,553
She lied
to her husband? Uh-oh.

134
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,355
So, what did you do?

135
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:28,792
Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say
you were out with friends?

136
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:30,927
Yeah. The Captain's
on his way home from Milan.

137
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:32,595
He can get a little jealous
sometimes,

138
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:34,697
so I didn't want
to make him worry.

139
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,499
Is that okay?

140
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,368
It's totally okay.

141
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:40,737
It's not okay! I didn't
really think it was okay!

142
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,373
Pur-leez! You lie to
your husband all the time.

143
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,642
"Uh, uh, that shirt
looks great on you""

144
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,444
"I love your mom""

145
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:49,879
"I never fantasize about
Barney when we're doing it""

146
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,415
Sound familiar, Pinocchio?

147
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,683
(scoffs)

148
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:54,884
What's wrong
with this shirt?

149
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:57,053
TED:
Lily, ruling.

150
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:58,388
Do I have to stop

151
00:04:58,389 --> 00:04:59,923
hanging out with Zoey?

152
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,025
No, you just need
to spend time

153
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,094
with her
and The Captain together.

154
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,929
If you're friends
with the both of them,

155
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,363
then there's not a problem.

156
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:09,766
Actually, I do have a standing
invitation from The Captain

157
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,235
to go for a ride with them
on his boat.

158
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:15,238
Great. So go make nice
with Captain Creepy,

159
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,439
and problem solved.

<i>He's just staring at me!</i>

180
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:03,653
<i>She's just staring at me!</i>

181
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,922
<i>It's making me nervous.</i>

182
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:07,924
<i>Great, now my left eye
is twitching.</i>

183
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,559
<i>Marshall, it's cool.</i>

184
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,227
<i>She doesn't see it.</i>

185
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:14,264
<i>What the hell's going on
with his eye?</i>

186
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:16,499
<i>Am I supposed to not talk
about that?</i>

187
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,069
<i>Great, now
my right eye is doing it.</i>

188
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,340
Can I get you two some drinks?

189
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,209
Lots of drinks.
Oh, so many drinks.

190
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,112
<i>NARRATOR: That same night, Barney
and Lily were still fighting</i>

191
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:30,647
<i>about, um... something.</i>

192
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,849
<i>Or was it that other thing?</i>

193
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,284
Barney.
Save it, Lily.

194
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:36,553
I am still mad at you for...

195
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:39,656
something, and for
that other thing.

196
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:42,125
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

197
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:43,626
But let's be honest.

198
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,828
You've been super
sensitive lately.

199
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,964
(crying):
No, I haven't!

200
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,366
God, how can you say that?!

201
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,168
Watch out!
(yells)

202
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,404
NARRATOR:
Wait. They were on the street.

203
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:56,940
Watch out!
Oh!

204
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:59,909
Wow. Thanks, Lily.

205
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,278
You saved me.

206
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,047
You saved us.

207
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:07,984
Look, I know
you didn't mean

208
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:11,087
whatever it was
you said that made me so mad.

209
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:13,323
I think I probably didn't.

210
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:16,793
<i>NARRATOR: And just like
that, the fight was over.</i>

211
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:19,762
<i>You know, kids,
friendship is funny sometimes.</i>

212
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,130
Wait.

213
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:24,133
I still can't resist
getting one last shot in.

214
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:25,602
(gasps)

215
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:28,938
<i>NARRATOR: Like I said, the
fight was just getting started.</i>

216
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:41,651
Hi, Captain.

217
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,019
The Captain.

218
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,587
Captain.

219
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:45,855
Ahoy, Ted!

220
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,056
Excellent to see you.

221
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:48,725
Ah, you, too.
Uh, where's Zoey?

222
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,026
Well, I'm afraid

223
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:52,195
she's feeling a little
under the weather.

224
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:53,263
Looks like it's just

225
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,831
you, me

226
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:57,033
and six hours
in frigid international waters.

227
00:07:57,034 --> 00:08:01,938
Or we could stay on dry land,
hang out with some... witnesses.

228
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,607
(laughs)
You're a hoot.

229
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:07,910
I've been looking
forward to this.

230
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:13,316
For a very long time.

231
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:15,985
Well, anchors aweigh!

232
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,721
<i>NARRATOR: Kids, here's
one thing I do remember.</i>

233
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,724
<i>I was pretty sure
I was going to die that night.</i>

234
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,678
Mmm.

235
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,213
Mmm.

236
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:35,051
You know, I had this really
boring poetry class in college.

237
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:39,288
You were just thinking that
this dinner is really boring.

239
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,124
That's what made you think of
your boring class in college.

240
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,160
What?! What? No! No!
No, no, no.

241
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:45,695
Marshall, no. No. I...

242
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:49,799
<i>I just saw that board
of specials, and I thought,</i>

243
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,500
you know what sucks?

244
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,735
Being bored.

245
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,903
Which I am not.

246
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:59,075
So that clears that... right up.

247
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,443
Robin, I'm an attorney.

248
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:01,611
(sighs)

249
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,145
Fine. This night's
a little awkward.

250
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,982
I guess it's 'cause we never
hang out alone together.

251
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,083
Why is that?

252
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:09,418
It's 'cause
of The Mermaid Theory.

253
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,056
<i>Two years ago, I had just hired
a new assistant at GNB.</i>

254
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:19,528
So, who's the eye broccoli?

255
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,897
Okay, that's Iris,
my new assistant.

256
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:24,066
And yes, she's a little plain,

257
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,869
but I'm married, so that's good.

258
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,204
Mark my words, Marshall.

259
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:31,173
Someday you will find Iris
so excruciatingly attractive,

260
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:34,844
you won't be able to look her
directly in the boobs.

261
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:41,450
I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

262
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:44,987
Marshall, do you know how
the myth of mermaids came to be?

263
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,455
I'm sorry. Myth?

264
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,824
It was 300 years ago.

265
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:51,594
<i>Sailors stuck at sea
would get desperate</i>

266
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:52,895
<i>for female companionship.</i>

267
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:56,599
<i>It got so bad
that, eventually,</i>

268
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,403
<i>the manatees out in the water
started to look like...</i>

269
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:02,538
<i>beautiful women.</i>

270
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:05,975
<i>Mermaids.</i>

271
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,979
Let's go get some tail!

272
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:13,983
Oh.

273
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,422
You see, every woman, no matter
how initially repugnant,

274
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:22,458
has a mermaid clock--
the time it takes

275
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,127
for you to realize
you want to bone her.

276
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:28,097
Sure, today you see Iris
as a manatee.

277
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,299
But she ain't gonna
stay that way.

278
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,838
Marshall, your secretary's
mermaid clock starts right now.

279
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,406
(clock ticking)

280
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:40,276
<i>MARSHALL: And it took one year,
three months, and 16 days,</i>

281
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:42,378
<i>but eventually...</i>

282
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,213
(alarm bell dings)

283
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,354
(panting)

284
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,722
D'oh!

285
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,423
Told you.

286
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,092
The Mermaid Theory.

287
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,259
It's a thing.

288
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,928
You owe me 500 bucks.

289
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,162
Did we bet on this?

290
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:02,198
Let's say yes.

291
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,101
And that's why we never
hang out alone? Yes.

292
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:07,870
As Lily's best friend, you are
the last person on the planet

293
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,505
o's allowed
to turn into a mermaid.

294
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:10,673
Wait, does that mean

295
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,608
that I'm a manatee right now?

296
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,346
Big-time manatee.

297
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:20,850
What were those
sailors thinking?

298
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:23,986
Huh. I don't know.

299
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:28,124
Being out at sea can do
crazy things to a man.

300
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,993
Vast, the sea.

301
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:33,028
Deep.

302
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,264
Endless.

303
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:38,667
Going around for miles.

304
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:43,305
You could scream and scream,
and not a soul would hear you.

305
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:46,342
Listen to this.

306
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:47,510
(screams)

307
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:48,677
Help!

308
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,346
Somebody help me!

309
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:53,082
I'm trapped on a boat
with a madman!

310
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,717
Help!

311
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:59,388
See? Nothing.

<i>Okay, calm down, Teddy.</i>

316
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,230
<i>He's not jealous.</i>

317
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,232
He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.

318
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,534
So, Ted,

319
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:16,372
I noticed you've been spending
a lot of time with Zoey.

320

323
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:26,315
Seriously? I step away for
five seconds, and you eat

324

all my onion rings?

325
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,352
No surprise there.

What's that supposed to mean?

327
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,590
Are you calling me fat?

328
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,359
If there is one thing
you never do,

329
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,463
it is call a woman fat
right to her face!

330
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:42,531
<i>Wait. Barney's not a woman.</i>

331

00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,838
<i>Lily was hurt by Barney.</i>

333
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,905

00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:40,189
What are our exact
nautical coordinates?

356
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,824
How now?

357
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,859
Oh, bother.

358
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,062
(sighs) Well...

359
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:49,398
she's a goner.

360
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:53,335
By now, the icy tide
has already dropped

361
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:56,539
its core temperature
to near freezing.

362
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,108
And down it goes.

363
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,310
Now it's at 50 meters.

364
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:04,780
Complete crushing blackness.

365
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,482
100 meters.

366
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:08,183
The pressure is so intense,

367
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:11,153
the keys are popping
right out of its head.

368
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,756
Head?
200 meters.

369
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:17,293
No one will ever find
its mangled remains,

370
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:19,728
save for the crustacea

371
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:23,332
that feed off
its lifeless husk.

372
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,434
Can you hear me now?

373
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:29,838
No. Because you're
on the bottom of the sea.

374
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:33,576
Well, I got a big
morning, so...

375
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:36,378
Dry cleaners, bank, you
know, so... Ted, it's time.

376
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,580
(whimpers)

377
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,815
I have something
for you.

378
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,650
Wait here.

379
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:47,556
<i>Okay, you got to swim
for it, Mosby.</i>

380
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:49,391
<i>Man versus sea.</i>

381
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:50,526
<i>You can do this.</i>

382
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,127
<i>You didn't get
a "Good Effort" ribbon</i>

383
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:53,696
<i>from the Shaker Heights
JCC Swim Camp</i>

384
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,598
<i>because you don't
have what it takes.</i>

385
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,932
Found it.

386
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:57,967
Zoey told me

387
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:59,802
you're a scotch drinker.

388
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:02,471
I bought this special
for tonight.

389
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:05,074
<i>And just as I started
to realize that maybe</i>

390
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:07,810
<i>I wasn't in danger after all,
we hit a bump.</i>

391
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:09,411
Whoa!

392
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,013
(splash)

393
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:13,048
Ted?

394
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,058
that if you spend

395
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,594
too much time alone with me,
I'll turn into a mermaid?

396
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:23,564
Yes. I mean, sure, right now,
you're bald and leathery

397
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,532
ancovered in
a thick layer of blubber...

398
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,167
Am I blushing or...?

399
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:30,370
...but at some point, my stupid
male brain will transform you

400
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:34,174
into a foxy fish-babe singin'

401
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:38,276
"Part of Your World"
to my pants.

402
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:42,113
Okay, even if that happens, is
there any way to un-mermaid me?

403
00:15:42,114 --> 00:15:44,049
I asked Barney the same thing.

404
00:15:47,353 --> 00:15:49,287
Once mermaid-ified,
there's only one way

405
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,923
a woman can go back to being
unattractive again,

406
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:53,725
but it's pretty gruesome.

407
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,227
Death?

408
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,662
Worse. Pregnancy.

409
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:59,664
If a baby's on board that train,

410
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,067
it is headed straight back
to Manatee City...

411
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:05,003
where the grass ain't green
and the girls ain't pretty.

412
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:06,538
Pregnancy?

413
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,940
Mm-hmm.
Once a mermaid gets pregnant,

414
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,676
she becomes a manatee again.

415
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:13,712
Never thought
I'd say that sentence.

416
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:14,980
<i>Wait! That's it!</i>

417
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:17,215
That's what Barney and Lily were
fighting about!

418
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:18,416
The Mermaid Theory!

419
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,652
But their argument didn't happen
at the same time

420
00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:23,788
as all this other stuff.
I'm literally in the wrong year!

421
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,458
It happened much, much later
when Lily was...

422
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,592
<i>pregnant.</i>

423
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,594
Well, Lily, I guess it's
just you and me.

424
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,595
You wanna hang?

425
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:31,730
Nah.

426
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:33,031
(gasps)

427
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:34,232
Whenever we're alone, you spend

428
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,635
the whole time undressing me
with your eyes.

429
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:38,303
You even take off my shoes.

430
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:41,406
High heels chafe my shoulders.

431
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:43,375
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore.

432
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,810
Ever since you got pregnant,
you're just a big fat manatee.

433
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,279
(gasps)

434
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,215
Well, you're a big...

435
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,183
stupid octopus face!

436
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:56,288
<i>That was it! I remember now!</i>

437
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,890
Wow. Thanks, Barney.

438
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:00,358
You saved me.

439
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:04,396
You saved us.

440
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:07,065
If there's one thing
you never do,

441
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:09,768
it's call a woman "fat"
right to her face!

442
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,036
I'm sorry, Lily.

443
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:13,638
Hey, you want to see
a magic trick?

444
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:17,842
Oh...

445
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:20,312
You're a jerk.

446
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:22,714
(Barney chuckles)

447
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:23,949
Hey. Hey, wait.

448
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,451
Come on. I was kid...
Wait, wait, wait!

449
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,653
There's another addendum
to The Mermaid Theory.

450
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:31,923
A pregnant woman who's become
a manatee can become

451
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:33,592
a mermaid again
through one simple act.

452
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:34,593
What's that?

453
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,861
Breast-feeding. Hot.

454
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:37,862
Really?

455
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:39,531
Really.

456
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,866
When those things swell up to
three times their normal size...

457
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,368
so do I.

458
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,071
That's so sweet!

459
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:49,474
<i>See kids?
Told you I'd get it!</i>

460
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:53,278
Okay, now we're even!

461
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,247
<i>Yeah, that's the ending
to a whole other story.</i>

462
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:58,283
<i>We'll get there.</i>

463
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:00,986
So you really thought
I was gonna kill you?

464
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:03,622
Well... ish.

465
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,123
Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous.

466
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:08,393
If I wanted to kill you, I'd
invite you to my hunting lodge.

467
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:11,329
It's far more remote,
and I wouldn't have

468
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,200
to worry about you turning up in
some nosy fisherman's net.

469
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,534
See? It's stuff like that.

470
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:18,003
Why-why do you talk that way?

471
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:20,105
Oh, I'm just jesting for sport.

472
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:25,410
See, sometimes I don't
bond as well

473
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,312
with Zoey's younger friends.

474
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,914
But I know she really likes you.

475
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,752
I was hoping that maybe
we could be buddies.

476
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:36,721
We can.

477
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,723
We can be buddies.

478
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:40,325
Just not on a boat.

479
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:41,626
Fair enough.

480
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:42,927
The hunting lodge it is.

481
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,164
Ho-ho-ho!

482
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:49,200
(slurring): You know, once we
stopped trying to have a conversation

483
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,236
and just focused on
the drinking...

484
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:52,637
I had fun.

485
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:53,738
Yeah, me, too.

486
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:55,640
<i>And then a terrible thing
happened.</i>

487
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,108
<i>Marshall's beer goggles
kicked in</i>

488
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:59,944
<i>and his very drunk mind started
to see...</i>

489
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:06,284
No... No, no!

490
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:07,952
No! No,

491
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:09,254
don't turn!

492
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,790
Uh-oh.

493
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,625
I don't feel so good.

494
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:17,962
(vomits)

495
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:22,133
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
I am, I am so sorry!

496
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:26,037
Oh! You must think
I'm totally disgusting.

497
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,339
I really do.

498
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,011
<i>And from that moment on</i>

499
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:34,112
<i>Marshall never worried</i>

500
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:35,780
<i>about Robin becoming
a mermaid again,</i>

501
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:38,216
<i>and the two of them were
closer than ever.</i>

502
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:39,751
There you go.

503
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:41,219
Hey, Ted.

504
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,654
Hey. You feeling
better?

505
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,989
I have a confession
to make.

506
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,059
I wasn't really sick.

507
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,893
You weren't?

508
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:49,894
I'm sorry.

509
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,329
I was just feeling guilty

510
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,131
that I lied
to The Captain and...

511
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:56,601
I don't know, I just thought it
would be good

512
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:58,636
if you two spent some time
together.

513
00:19:58,637 --> 00:19:59,904
I get it.

514
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,005
And you were right.

515
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:02,507
He's a nice guy.

516
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:04,776
I mean, he can be
a little scary.

517
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:07,979
Yeah, he gets a little murder-y
when he's nervous.

518
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,748
Yeah, he's a creepy dude.

519
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,249
But I like him.

520
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,485
And I just want to make sure

521
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:15,386
you and I hanging out

522
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:17,956
doesn't, you know,
cross any lines.

523
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:19,357
Me, too.

524
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:22,093
I mean, if either one of us had
even the slightest hint

525
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:24,562
of feelings for the other,
we shouldn't hang out.

526
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:26,331
You don't, do you?

527
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,833
No. Do you?

528
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,735
No.

529
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:33,972
(clock ticking)

530
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:40,727
Still no sign
of land.

531
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:44,097
It's been 243 days
since we've seen

532
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,132
another living soul.

533
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:58,611
What are you looking at?
