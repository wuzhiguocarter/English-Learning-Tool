00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:04,383
<i>Kids, sometimes wonderful things</i>

2
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:06,552
<i>come out of horrible situations.</i>

3
00:00:06,553 --> 00:00:08,587
<i>Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong</i>

4
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:09,521
<i>where I got stuck in the airport?</i>

5
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:11,441
<i>Well, a funny thing happened that day.</i>

6
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:13,526
Yes, I realize it's raining,

7
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,161
but, come on, it's 2021.

8
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:17,096
We can make cell phones
that project holograms,

9
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:19,532
but a light drizzle shuts
down a whole airport?

10
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:20,333
Hey, Ted.

11
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:23,336
Hey...

12
00:00:23,337 --> 00:00:24,971
There she is.

13
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:26,789
Wow.

14
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,158
Wendy the Waitress. Wendy the Waitress!

15
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,178
I was just saying-- what are you doing here?

16
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,946
<i>What was she doing there?</i>

17
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:36,415
<i>For that, we have to back
up about ten years.</i>

18
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,800
So, Barney, I hear you and Nora

19
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,085
had a fun time at laser tag.

20
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:41,820
I don't know where you heard that.

21
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,022
It was a disaster.

22
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:44,557
Not according to her.

23
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,859
Oh, my God, this was so much fun.

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,194
We have to do this again. We do, we have to.

25
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:50,062
You want to grab a drink right now?

26
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,630
No, I'm kind of tired.

27
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:52,731
But...

28
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:53,766
this is my number.

29
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:54,833
Give me a call.

30
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,268
Absolutely.

31
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:57,703
How is that a disaster?

32
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,371
She didn't want to get drinks.

33
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:01,273
And as soon as a girl says

34
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,609
she doesn't want to get drinks, well...

35
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,245
You want to grab a drink right now? No,
I'm kind of tired.

36
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,619
Absolutely.

37
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,853
It's a shame, too.

38
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:17,289
She was a really great laser tag partner.

39
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,959
She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.

40
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,429
Please, Cheese. You like this girl.

41
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,930
What? Nora?

42
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,165
No, I don't.

43
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,667
Barney, you can't say her
name without smiling.

44
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,070
That's...

45
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:32,771
Nora.

46
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:34,306
Sorry, sorry.

47
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:35,808
I was thinking of a funny thing

48
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,209
that Nora said. Hmm.

49
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,277
Stop it.

50
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:39,378
No... ra.

51
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:40,479
Nah...

52
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,248
Damn it, what is the matter with me?

53
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,049
You like her. You should call her.

54
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,150
Call her?

55
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,886
she had a nice face,

56
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:51,190
her booty was in place,
but Barney don't chase.

57
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,625
That is ridiculous.

58
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:54,960
Barney, you know what, here's some advice.

59
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:02,868
Totally.

62
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,897
<i>Kids, I had just started dating Zoey.</i>

63
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,399
<i>And when you first start dating someone,</i>

64
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,734
<i>everyone wants to know the same thing.
How did we meet?</i>

65
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:26,670
Oh, Ted, she doesn't want... No,
it's a cute story.

66
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,322
Once upon a time...

67
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:31,208
<i>Zoey was married to this super rich,
super creepy guy</i>

68
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,875
<i>called The Captain.</i>

69
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,612
<i>So when Zoey and I became friends,</i>

70
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,747
<i>I was careful not to cross any lines.</i>

71
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,650
Oh, man, this movie is scary.

72
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,451
I know, right?

73
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,220
<i>But then one day,</i>

74
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:46,089
<i>Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight.</i>

75
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,292
<i>He flipped out and demanded a divorce.</i>

76
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,261
<i>And she was heartbroken.</i>

77
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:52,896
<i>But after a little soul-searching,</i>

78
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:56,816
<i>she ended up back in my life,
and the rest, as they say,</i>

79
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,102
is history.

80
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:01,638
Actually, I said, "How's your meat?"

81
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,206
Oh.

82
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,108
A little cold.

83
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,409
Gee, wonder why.

84
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,414
Oh, Ted, did you have a
chance to pick up that box

85
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,416
I left at my old apartment?

86
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,653
Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain.

87
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,055
I mean this in a super manly way.

88
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:21,090
That guy scares the panties off me.

89
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,325
You don't have to see him.

90
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,561
He left the box with the doorman.

91
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:27,230
If it's really important to you,
I will pick it up tomorrow.

92
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:29,632
All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big

93
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,802
meaningless stack of paperwork
that I have to get off my desk

94
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:35,839
to make room for tomorrow's big
meaningless stack of paperwork.

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,441
But it's all worth it,

96
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:42,078
you know, 'cause at least I know
I'm making the world a... place.

97
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,013
All right, see you guys later.

98
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,549
I'm worried about Marshall.

99
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,518
He doesn't seem like himself lately.

100
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,687
Yeah, he's been really... quiet.

101
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,789
Well, that's just what
Minnesota guys are like--

102
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,958
strong, silent, you know, man's man.

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,459
Like Prince.

104
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,261
No, it's more than that.

105
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,563
It's like, all the stuff he used to love,

106
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:04,100
he suddenly has no interest in anymore.

107
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,802
Oh.

108
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:07,504
Ha-wink.

109
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:08,872
Excuse me?

110
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,940
Lily, in my travels,

111
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:13,343
I've developed a finely calibrated sense

112
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:15,245
of how long it's been since--

113
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:17,447
How do I not put this delicately?--

114
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:18,781
a girl's been porked.

115
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:19,716
And, boo,

116
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,651
you've been pork-free so long,

117
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,253
you're practically kosher.

118
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,154
It's been a while.

119
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:27,991
Five weeks, three days by my estimation.

120
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:30,326
You should work at a carnival.

121
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:31,461
I tried.

122
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,196
They're pretty strict with backgrounds.

123
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:34,731
Anyway, we should get going.

124
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,199
Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.

125
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,735
Good night. Good night, guys.

126
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,145
18 weeks.

127
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:50,113
Damn it.

128
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:52,415
Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell.

129
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,416
Hmm.

130
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,884
But I just started a new job,

131
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,553
and dating's been on the back burner, and...

132
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:57,887
Shh.

133
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:01,090
Child, listen.

134
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,592
If you're really hurting for it,

135
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,861
I'd be more than happy to throw you one.

136
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:07,130
Throw me one? Yeah.

137
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,832
We're exes. We're probably
due for a backslide.

138
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,802
Or we could just do it the normal way.

139
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:14,704
Oh, I see what's going on.

140
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:15,738
Yeah?

141
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,240
This is about Nora.

142
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:21,828
You met a girl, you liked her,
but then you missed your shot.

143
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,647
And now you're trying to hook
up with your ex-girlfriend

144
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:26,816
to prove to yourself that you don't care.

145
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,152
Robin, you could not be more--

146
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,087
What do you mean I missed my shot?

147
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,989
Nora met a guy. What?!

148
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,525
What?

149
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:36,826
Yep. Off the market.

150
00:05:36,827 --> 00:05:38,845
He's taking her to Cafe
L'Amour this Friday night.

151
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:40,013
But "L'Amour" means love!

152
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:41,531
They're going to the cafe of love!

153
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:42,899
I'm fine. It's fine.

154
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,067
Point is,

155
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:47,604
Robin, I don't even like Nora.

156
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:49,005
Damn it!

157
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,444
Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?

158
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,245
I can't sleep.

159
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:58,147
Mmm.

160
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:01,551
Anything I can do to help you with that?

161
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:05,288
Maybe after this documentary on garbage.

162
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,825
Man, I am losing my touch.

163
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,127
Nearly twice the size of Texas,

164
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:14,163
the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch,
or "Garbage Island,"

165
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:16,032
is an enviwonmental disaster.

166
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,468
Sepawated from its pawents,

167
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,937
this young bird stwuggles to survive,

168
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:23,840
stwangling itself in the
plastic wings of a six-pack.

169
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,560
Marshall Eriksen, I think you
know what you have to do.

170
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,062
I have to save the planet!

171
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,780
Is it over? I call on top.

172
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,515
Ow!

173
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,651
<i>A few days later, I headed over
to The Captain's building</i>

174
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,152
<i>to get Zoey's box.</i>

175
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm here to... Ted.

176
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,889
What a surprise.

177
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,068
Ted.

178
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,570
Captain. I...

179
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:50,871
You've come to rescue me

180
00:06:50,872 --> 00:06:53,807
from the capsized wreckage of my marriage.

181
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,008
Mm...

182
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,143
I hesitated calling you

183
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:58,145
because I know you and Zoey were friendly.

184
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:00,147
Pssh, nah... But my wife has left me.

185
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,483
All my friends have abandoned me.

186
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:03,550
Please,

187
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:05,786
tell me you're on my side.

188
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,060
Let's adjourn to the study.

189
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,264
Garbage Island.

190
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:18,565
You haven't heard

191
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,734
of Garbage Island?

192
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:22,802
It's an island...

193
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:24,605
made of garbage!

194
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,340
It's in the Pacific Ocean.

195
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,442
It's twice the size of Texas!

196
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:31,311
In other words,
one-eighth the size of Canada.

197
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:33,380
So...

198
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,216
Guys, I'm going environmental, okay?

199
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:37,985
Phase one: the bar.

200
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,786
I've already convinced
MacLaren's to implement

201
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:40,888
a new green initiative.

202
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,055
That's 'cause of you?

203
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:44,625
I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles

204
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,827
to the recycling center every night.

205
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,795
I threw my back out.

206
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:51,865
You're welcome... Earth.

207
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,902
GNB.

208
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:56,520
Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation

209
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,672
in front of the board about how we can cut

210
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:02,242
our carbon footprint by
half for only $12 million.

211
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:04,178
Dude, don't do that.
All they're going to hear

212
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,580
is "$12 million,
" and all you're going to hear

213
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:08,782
is the sound of the door
smacking your fired ass.

214
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,851
And some muffled laughter.

215
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:12,619
Which I apologize for in advance.

216
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,921
Guys,

217
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:15,088
I got a problem.

218
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,457
I ran into The Captain.

219
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,627
Ted, beneath this

220
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:25,132
lustrous mane,
I wear the horns of a cuckold.

221
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,435
Zoey left me for another man.

222
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:30,804
Wow.

223
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:33,173
Do you have any idea who it could be?

224
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:35,475
<i>The Captain then told a story much different</i>

225
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:36,810
than the one I'd been telling.

226
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:39,079
<i>But one maybe just as true.</i>

227
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,182
Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy.

228
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,384
Blissful as Arcadian shepherds.

229
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,552
<i>I was Poseidon,</i>

230
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:47,854
<i>she my Amphitrite.</i>

231
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:49,656
<i>I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis</i>

232
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:51,758
could not have torn us asunder.

233
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,162
We had great big boners for each other.

234
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,897
But then...

235
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:59,132
enter the scoundrel.

236
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,469
Oh, man, this movie's scary.

237
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,439
I know, eh?

238
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,623
<i>I don't know what he looks like,</i>

239
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:07,841
<i>but I picture him with a mustache.</i>

240
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:09,076
<i> Yes!</i>

241
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:11,845
Limit the search to guys
with mustaches. Smart.

242
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:15,415
Anyway, soon the inevitable happened.

243
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,218
<i>She told me she was in love
with someone else.</i>

244
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,287
<i>Obviously, it made me angry.</i>

245
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:22,689
And that's the last time you saw her.

246
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,658
But I gathered my composure,

247
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,727
<i>and told her I'd do anything to keep her.</i>

248
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,428
<i>I begged her not to leave.</i>

249
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:30,397
<i>We made love that night.</i>

250
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:34,301
That's damn good brandy.

251
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:36,270
But morning came,

252
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:38,238
and she was gone.

253
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:40,991
Oh, Captain...

254
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:42,476
don't blame yourself.

255
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:45,212
I don't blame myself. Hmm?

256
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:49,116
There's only one man I blame for this.

257
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,083
Me.

258
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,352
I'm the bad guy.

259
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:55,622
Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story

260
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:57,624
of picking up the box for Zoey,

261
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,159
you're the hero.

262
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,994
Damn it! The box!

263
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:10,804
Baby, baby, I really got to
work on this presentation.

264
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:12,406
Oh, that's too bad,

265
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:15,859
'cause I was going to make a
little presentation of my own.

266
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:21,915
from now until tomorrow afternoon,

267
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:26,553
I do this, and then
tomorrow night, I do that.

268
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:27,754
Deal.

269
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,959
Come on, come on.

270
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,328
Lily!

271
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:40,300
You lying little minx.

272
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,936
I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight

273
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,439
from 5:00 p.m. until closing,

274
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,607
reading a newspaper with
two holes cut out of it,

275
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,142
and I never saw Nora

276
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:50,944
or this Italian race car
driver she's dating.

277
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:52,779
Sorry. Who said anything about an...?

278
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,015
Come on, you just know he's
an Italian race car driver.

279
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:56,216
No, he's not. He doesn't exist.

280
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,685
I made the whole thing up
to see if you like her.

281
00:10:58,686 --> 00:10:59,953
And you do.

282
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:02,255
So you should just call her.

283
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:05,025
Here is her number.

284
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,030
And I also programmed it

285
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:12,666
into your phone while you
were in the bathroom.

286
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:19,840
Wow. That was a joke.
You just got here, remember?

287
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:23,176
You really are smitten.

288
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:24,444
No, I'm not.

289
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:25,545
I'm Barney Stinson.

290
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:28,382
I don't get smitten, I smite!

291
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,983
You are totally smitten,

292
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:31,952
but you're scared of
being in a relationship.

293
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:33,053
No, I'm not.

294
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:35,922
I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin.

295
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:38,191
If I got serious with Nora, it would be like

296
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,093
if Mother Teresa focused
all her attention on

297
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:42,195
one really hot orphan.

298
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:45,732
With great penis comes great responsibility.

299
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:49,236
Okay, Mother Teresa,

300
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:50,604
throw me one.

301
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,005
Sorry?

302
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:54,207
I would like it if you threw me one.

303
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,842
Fastball, right down the middle.

304
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:59,112
Actually, if I recall correctly,
a slight curve.

305
00:11:59,113 --> 00:12:01,448
Careful, Robin, I'll do it.

306
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:03,250
Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm.

307
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,719
Because you don't want to
screw things up with Nora.

308
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,887
Hey, prove me wrong.

309
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:08,555
Tomorrow night, my place.

310
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:10,123
Don't poke the dragon, Robin,

311
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:13,260
'cause the dragon will poke you back.

312
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,866
Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after.

313
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:21,268
Oh, no, baby, come on.

314
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:23,637
Today didn't go so well.

315
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,839
The green initiative,

316
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,741
for only $12 million, will change the way...

317
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:28,875
Okay, I've heard enough.

318
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:31,344
Don't we already have a green initiative?

319
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,613
I mean, didn't we do a whole thing?

320
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,982
Hang a banner, make a video,
Sting was there.

321
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,384
I thought I met Sting.

322
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:38,418
You did meet Sting.

323
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,669
Yeah, I met Sting.

324
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,305
So why on Earth would we
spend another $12 million?

325
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:44,090
Well, because we can always do more.

326
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:46,059
Yeah, but I met Sting.

327
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,895
Well, meeting Sting isn't
gonna fix anything, Arthur!

328
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:52,599
Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?

329
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:56,670
Well, he has some good points.

330
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:57,871
Meeker, you're fired!

331
00:12:57,872 --> 00:13:01,074
And as for you, Eriksen...
His father just died.

332
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:02,909
...nice presentation.

333
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,778
We'll keep it under advisement.

334
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,781
Meeker got fired because of me.

335
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:09,616
I'm the bad guy.

336
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,785
No, sweetie, just-just put all that

337
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:14,120
out of your mind and relax.

338
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:18,825
Look, I got you a six-pack
of tall boys from the deli.

339
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,034
Hey, baby. Yeah?

340
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,003
What happened to the plastic rings

341
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,005
that held the six-pack together?

342
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,807
Oh, I-I don't know.

343
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:35,508
I threw them down the garbage chute.

344
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,693
Let's just use the handcuffs instead.

345
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,179
Baby, birds can get caught in those

346
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,414
and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish!

347
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:42,582
Weren't you listening?

348
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,417
Don't you care about Garbage Island?

349
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,253
Marshall, right now,
I don't give a wat's ass

350
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:47,220
about Garbage Island.

351
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,822
Well, I do.

352
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,624
I got to find those rings!

353
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,529
Cwap.

354
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,998
Hi, I'm here to pick up...

355
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,332
Hello, Ted.

356
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,500
To the study?

357
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,736
To the study! Mmm.

358
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:05,722
Ted...

359
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,743
I know.

360
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:11,411
Know what?

361
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:13,246
I know who stole my Zoey.

362
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,882
No man likes to be betrayed,

363
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:17,551
especially by a friend.

364
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,486
You can imagine then

365
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:22,255
how painful it was when
I learned that the name

366
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,490
of my betrayer is...

367
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:26,660
Ted...

368
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,945
when I tell you who it is, you're gonna...

369
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:33,800
It's my doorman!

370
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:37,537
That son of a bitch!

371
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:43,792
You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?

372
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:47,429
He always winks and tips
his hat when he sees her.

373
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,247
I know how these things work.

374
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:50,365
He holds her package,

375
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,033
and pretty soon, she's holding his.

376
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,001
And then there's

377
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:54,769
his glorious mustache.

378
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,371
I will have him fired for this!

379
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,573
No, no, no, you can't fire him.

380
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,041
You're right.

381
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:05,380
Maritime protocol demands
physical retribution!

382
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:06,515
Oh, my God! No, no!

383
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,266
No physical retribution! Stop!

384
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,652
Who is this flower child,
and what has he done

385
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,521
with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!

386
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:14,356
Look, look, yes, yes,

387
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,124
the doorman is a scoundrel.

388
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,776
The mustache alone gives that away.

389
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:20,779
He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!

390
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,431
Whoa, "rapscallion"
may be going a bit far, Ted.

391
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:25,367
But it's not his fault, okay?

392
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:26,902
It's nobody's fault.

393
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,236
You and Zoey

394
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:29,638
have nothing in common.

395
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,640
For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats!

396
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,841
You're just

397
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:34,075
not right for each other.

398
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:36,711
Look, I know it's tough to face,
but I'm sure

399
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:39,381
a small part of you has always known that.

400
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,388
Why couldn't she just like boats?

401
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,758
Just to have one thing in common?

402
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,560
Other girls like boats, don't they?

403
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:53,428
Of course they do.

404
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:56,064
And you'll find one.

405
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:57,832
And you'll be much happier with her

406
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,734
than you ever were with Zoey.

407
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,371
When you put it that way,

408
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:05,774
I should almost thank the doorman.

409
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:08,610
Yeah, yeah!

410
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:12,814
And, you know, since,
since it doesn't really matter

411
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,516
who Zoey's dating now...

412
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:15,950
It doesn't, it really doesn't.

413
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,185
It doesn't.

414
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:20,322
It's me. You're welcome.

415
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,066
Okay, baby, what gives?

416
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,768
I'm sorry, but neither of
us are getting any action

417
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:35,737
until I find those rings.

418
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:39,641
I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.

419
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:44,496
All right, Robin,

420
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:45,780
give it to me.

421
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,650
Damn it, Barney, you failed my test!

422
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,719
You know, I- I try to root for you.

423
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,953
Even as your ex-girlfriend,

424
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:53,622
when you meet someone, I'm like,

425
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:55,257
"Yeah, Barney, go get her!"

426
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:57,092
But you know what? Just forget it.

427
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:59,994
You're never gonna change.
I'm done trying to help you.

428
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:03,265
The number.

429
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:07,102
Give me the number,
'cause I really can't tell...

430
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:10,872
Is that a seven or a nine?

431
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:12,140
It's a five, idiot.

432
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:15,377
A fi...? In what moon man
language is that a five?

433
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:17,445
"Moon man language"?
What does that even mean?

434
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:19,447
How am I supposed to see that's a five?

435
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:21,516
Look how you taped this up...
Fine, fine, fine.

436
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:23,851
I have a phone call to make.

437
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:26,721
Barney.

438
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,190
Go get her.

439
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,762
Listen, Zoey,

440
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,231
I need to ask you something.

441
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,932
Did I steal you?

442
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,502
Well... yeah.

443
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:42,103
You did.

444
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,505
By being the kind of

445
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:46,474
sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think

446
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:49,544
of stealing someone, you stole me.

447
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:51,780
So I'm the bad guy.

448
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,748
Great.

449
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:55,684
Well, the story isn't over, Ted.

450
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,019
It'll be years before we
know who's the good guy

451
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,487
and who's the bad guy.

452
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,256
I mean, yes,

453
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:02,907
divorce sucks,

454
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:07,062
but sometimes things need to fall apart

455
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:09,230
to make way for better things.

456
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:12,233
If you say so.

457
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:15,203
I'm just saying,
the eggs are already broken.

458
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:18,006
Let's make sure we get a
pretty good omelet out of it.

459
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:21,075
Okay, Marshall,

460
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:23,945
seriously, what's going on?

461
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:28,917
He'll never get to see how I turn out.

462
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:30,585
What do you mean?

463
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:32,387
My dad. You know,

464
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,756
I used to, um, I used to always tell him

465
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:36,458
that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer.

466
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,693
And he was always so proud of me for that.

467
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:39,961
But he never

468
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:42,864
got to see the version of
me that was anything but

469
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,799
a corporate stooge.

470
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,468
And now it's too late.

471
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,938
And we're starting a family, you know.

472
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,240
Are you avoiding sleeping with me

473
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:54,442
'cause you don't want to start a family?

474
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:58,146
Lily, if we have a baby right now,

475
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:01,850
that is just it for me.

476
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,185
The cement will dry,

477
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:07,756
and I will be stuck at GNB forever.

478
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,791
Marshall,

479
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:13,194
if you want to quit your job and
go work for the NRDC right now,

480
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,797
then you need to do that right now.

481
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,065
And then,

482
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:19,401
once you've cleaned up all the oceans

483
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:21,603
and saved the planet--

484
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:25,640
you know, like, a year from now--
then we'll start a family.

485
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,642
I don't know.

486
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:30,645
So far, in the name of saving the planet,

487
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:34,082
I've ruined your night,
I practically broke Wendy's back

488
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,884
and I got Meeker fired.

489
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,352
The guy must hate me.

490
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:38,887
Meeker doesn't hate you.

491
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:41,089
<i>Oh, Meeker hated him, all right.</i>

492
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,209
<i>After all, Marshall was the
one who got him fired.</i>

493
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,094
<i>Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's.</i>

494
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:48,463
<i>So that night, he went there
to confront Marshall.</i>

495
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:50,298
<i>But as luck would have it...</i>

496
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,934
Are you guys...? Closed. Sorry.

497
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:58,106
Thanks.

498
00:19:58,107 --> 00:19:59,774
Rough night?

499
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:01,876
Yeah. I'm sorry.

500
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:05,113
It's not your fault. It's no one's fault.

501
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:06,781
Except for Marshall Eriksen.

502
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,450
What did you just say?

503
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:12,153
Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault.

504
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:13,455
Why, do you know him?

505
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:16,224
Know him? I hate that guy.

506
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,859
Me, too.

507
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,661
Well, hey.

508
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:23,198
<i>And the rest, as they say...</i>

509
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,566
...is history.

510
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,134
And three kids later,

511
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:28,870
we decided to come here
on our second honeymoon.

512
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:30,722
Wow.

513
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,607
That's a pretty good omelet.

514
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,442
Oh, and hey, what about you?

515
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,477
You still with Zoey?

516
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:39,180
No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well.

517
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:40,265
But it's all for the best,

518
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:41,516
'cause now I'm married to

519
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,268
an amazing girl, we have two kids.

520
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:45,753
It's actually a funny story of how we met.

521
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:48,490
<i>I was a best man at this wedding...</i>

522
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:51,459
Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you,
but we got to run.

523
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,696
Okay, well, have a safe trip.
It was great seeing you.

524
00:21:00,603 --> 00:21:02,303
Hello. Marshall.

525
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,404
Hey, Ted.

526
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:07,008
Hey. You will not believe
who I just ran into.
