1
00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:04,330
<i>Kids, as you know, I was designing
Goliath National Bank's new headquarters</i>

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,506
<i>on the site of this old hotel,
The Arcadian.</i>

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:10,732
<i>Problem was, some people didn't want
The Arcadian torn down.</i>

4
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:14,932
<i>Even bigger problem,
they were led by my girlfriend Zoey.</i>

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,976
Hang on, hang on, hang on!
Hey, sweetie!

6
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:20,604
Are we still on for dinner
at 8:00 at Valenzisi's?

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,921
That's great!
I can't wait!

8
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:26,068
<i>That's great.
I can't wait!</i>

9
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:30,572
<i>But somehow,
Zoey and I were making it work.</i>

10
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:33,396
Ted, why are you dating
our arch-enemy?

11
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,473
Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying
to sleep with the Roadrunner.

12
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:38,330
Or maybe he was.

13
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:39,623
Think about it.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,218
The way that she bats her eyelashes

15
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:45,069
and shakes her tail feathers
in his face?

16
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:46,380
She wants it.

17
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,884
Isn't it hard for you guys
to be on opposite sides of this?

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,545
Of course you feel that way.

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,574
You and Marshall have basically melded
into one big hermaphroditic blob.

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,392
And that's fine for you guys.

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,145
But some of us want a partner
who challenges us to grow and evolve.

22
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,898
You guys are in screaming
matches all the time.

23
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:07,988
Growing matches.

24
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:11,113
<i>It was true, Zoey and I loved
to challenge each other.</i>

25
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:14,265
The main character
is a young spoiled prince

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,451
thrust into leadership
after the death of his father.

27
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:19,027
It's obviously a modern-day
retelling of <i>Henry IV!</i>

28
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,492
Are you kidding me?

29
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:22,988
It's <i>Don Quixote</i>,
the classic quest story

30
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:25,927
with the hero-jester
and his long-suffering manservant!

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,341
Clearly, when we're watching <i>Tommy Boy</i>,
we're watching two different movies.

32
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,301
No, you hang up.

33
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,012
No, you hang up.

34
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,649
No, you hang up.

35
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:38,872
No, you hang up.

36
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:40,622
No, you hang up!

37
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,925
No, you hang up.

38
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,656
No, you hang up.

39
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,397
No, you...

40
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:47,523
Hold on.

41
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:53,118
For the love of God, will one
of you idiots hang up the phone?

42
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:58,994
Why would you do that?

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,246
I thought you'd like it.

44
00:02:01,636 --> 00:02:02,956
Who likes that?

45
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:04,875
I like it.

46
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,504
Your relationship sounds exhausting.

47
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,715
Maybe yours is a bit lazy.

48
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:15,121
Marshall and I have been together
15 years,

49
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:17,921
and the only debate
we've had about <i>Tommy Boy</i>

50
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:20,643
is whether it's awesome
or super awesome.

51
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,434
That's love, bitch.

52
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:26,326

57
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:40,522
<i>Now around this time,
Marshall had truly come to hate his job.</i>

58
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,590
<i>He hated the paperwork.</i>

59
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:45,736
<i>He hated the coffee.</i>

60
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,610
<i>He hated the dirty jokes.</i>

61
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,275
<i>He hated everything.</i>

62
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,239
- I have to quit.
- Quit GNB? Why?

63
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:01,045
I need to do better things
with my life, okay?

64
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,147
There's an opening
for an environmental lawyer

65
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,018
at the National Resources
Defense Council.

66
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,561
Sure, it pays less,

67
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:09,923
but I'd be saving the oceans,
saving endangered species...

68
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:13,151
Saving chicken bones
and an old boot to make hobo soup?

69
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,399
You can't pay your mortgage
with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.

70
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,578
You have my full support.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,788
Then, forgot that trip to Spain
that you've been planning.

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,708
Say good-bye
to riding around in gondolas,

73
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:32,793
and eating bratwurst
and seeing the pyramids.

74
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,715
I don't think you know what Spain is.

75
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,886
I know that a trip there
costs some serious lira.

76
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,389
- It's dinero.
- Where? I want his autograph!

77
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:46,006
<i>So Marshall walked in the next morning
all ready to quit.</i>

78
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:48,265
<i>But then something weird happened.</i>

79
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,773
<i>Suddenly, he didn't hate
the paperwork.</i>

80
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:55,767
<i>He didn't hate the coffee.</i>

81
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,489
<i>He didn't even hate the dirty jokes.</i>

82
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>Out of nowhere,
Marshall actually liked GNB.</i>

83
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,041
- It's graduation goggles.
- What?

84
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,085
Graduation goggles,
like with high school.

85
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:15,323
It's four years of bullies
making fun of all the kids with braces,

86
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:18,133
even after the braces come off
and they can walk just fine.

87
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,590
But on graduation day,
you suddenly get all misty

88
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:23,054
'cause you realize you're never going
to see those jerks again.

89
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:26,474
I just had graduation goggles
with that guy Scooby I dated.

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,643
The guy who was basically a dog?

91
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,104
He was the worst kisser
I've ever been with.

92
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,093
But the moment
I decided to dump him...

93
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,903
I suddenly got kind of wistful.

94
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:43,074
He was a good boy.

95
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,911
I've been there, too.

96
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,074
Every time I'm done having sex
with a woman,

97
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,506
at first,
I never want to see her again.

98
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:53,239
But then...

99
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:01,797
No, that's pretty much it.

100
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,592
The point is, you can't trust
graduation goggles.

101
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,728
They're just as misleading
as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles,

102
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,911
and that's-just-a-bulky,
outdated-cell-phone

103
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:14,816
in-his-front-pocket goggles.

104
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:16,951
That one was a bummer.

105
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,508
You're right.

106
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,445
Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.

107
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,821
You can't quit tomorrow!

108
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:25,577
The lady with the big nipples is coming
to give a sexual harassment seminar,

109
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:28,912
and I bribed one of the maintenance guys
to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!

110
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,166
More than ever,
you have my full support.

111
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,796
You know, sometimes I feel
bad for Lily and Marshall.

112
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:40,006
I'm starting to feel bad
for Ted and Zoey.

113
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:45,095
It starts with an... "L?"

114
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,389
How can you not remember my name?

115
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,455
It's like they never
challenge each other.

116
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,559
They just automatically
agree all the time.

117
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,895
- They don't do that all the time.
- Yes, they do.

118
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,563
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do.

119
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,679
It's like they
don't see eye-to-eye on anything!

120
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,444
Totally.

121
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,613
It rhymes with your name.

122
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,660
And I said my name was...?

123
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,405
I did it! I quit.

124
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,126
And then I walked right over to
the NRDC, and I took that job.

125
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,253
Good for you, sweetie.

126
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,473
It's a little less money
than I was expecting.

127
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,550
Compared to what I was
making at GNB, it's nothing.

128
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,386
Actually compared to anything,
it's nothing. It's nothing.

129
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:30,987
The paid position just got filled,
so all I can do is volunteer right now.

130
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,976
You're cool with that, right?

131
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,062
Baby, if this is what you need
to do, we'll figure it out.

132
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,648
How's Barney handling you leaving?

133
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,406
There's a bunch of models
in the lobby,

134
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,715
and the gossip is
one of them is really a dude.

135
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,032
You wanna play
"Who's Hot and Who's Scott?"

136
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,413
It's always the one
in the turtleneck, Ted.

137
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:58,293
And no, I don't want to play.
Stupid Marshall ruined everything.

138
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,837
Come on.
Everything's not ruined.

139
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,590
- Guys, everything's ruined.
- What? Why?

140
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,087
Your girlfriend got
the Landmark Preservation Committee

141
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:07,534
to agree to a hearing.

142
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,972
If they declare the Arcadian a landmark,
the whole project is dead.

143
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,602
Good news, I got the phone number of
a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.

144
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:26,395
So, if the Landmarks Preservation
Committee sides with Zoey,

145
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,537
your whole project
goes down the tubes?

146
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:29,989
You must be furious.

147
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:33,910
I'm furiously enjoying
being challenged.

148
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:37,453
Why don't you admit that your girlfriend
challenging your every move

149
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,916
is getting you
a little murder-suicidey?

150
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:43,225
And you that Marshall quitting his job
and taking an unpaid internship

151
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,872
- is killing you?
- It's not.

152
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:49,425
The downside to having giant, Japanese
anime eyes is they're easy to read.

153
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:51,024
And yours are screaming,

154
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,179
"What about my trip to Spain,
deadbeat?"

155
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,587
The downside
to having a woman's mouth

156
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:59,335
is your feminine pout
gives away your true feelings.

157
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,763
And yours is saying,

158
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:04,357
"Oh, Zoey, why can't I be
on top just this once?"

159
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:05,723
We take turns!

160
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,448
Sometimes.

161
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:12,553
I just had the best first day
at the NRDC.

162
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,467
I'm sorry. Sorry.

163
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,790
Something Hershel said at work today.

164
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:23,250
Hershel?

165
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,601
Don't you guys know Hershel?
Didn't I tell you?

166
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:28,131
He's the new lawyer
who replaced Marshall at GNB.

167
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:33,052
He is so awesome and funny
and tall... taller than Marshall...

168
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,638
and he knows way more laws.

169
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm glad you like your new co-worker.

170
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,411
There's no Hershel!
I was saying that to make you jealous!

171
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,803
Why do you insist
we play these games?

172
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,857
- Just come back to GNB already!
- I'm really loving my new job.

173
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:48,818
And I'm loving seeing you this happy.

174
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:51,748
I'm so glad to hear you say that
because I volunteered our apartment

175
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:54,657
for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow.
You're cool with that, right?

176
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,827
- Baby, you have my full support.
- Thanks, baby.

177
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,747
I gotta go.
The invitations are ready.

178
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:04,800
The party's for environmentalists,
so I found a guy downtown

179
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,927
who makes biodegradable
party invitations

180
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,084
that can also be used
as toilet paper.

181
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:11,757
That's how I'm gonna use mine.

182
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:15,913
Why in the world do you care so much
whether Marshall works at GNB?

183
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:19,224
Care? I don't care.
I'm like, whatever. Marshall who?

184
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,684
He's stupid.
Hershel's way better.

185
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,721
Is it possible that with everything
that's gone on with your dad lately,

186
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:28,061
you might have some
unresolved abandonment issues

187
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,049
you're transferring onto Marshall?

188
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,195
You are worse than my shrink.

189
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,031
"Barney,
we have to talk about your father."

190
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:39,009
"I'm not gonna teach you to hypnotize
people. You'll only use it for evil."

191
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:41,115
"I am not gonna conduct
a couples session

192
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,748
"between you and this woman.
She's obviously a prostitute."

193
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:45,314
I don't need this!

194
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,604
Half of the world's
most perfect couple!

195
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:53,916
I was thinking about your comment
and I have three good comebacks.

196
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,344
One, your mom didn't seem
to mind it last night...

197
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,379
I need a favor. Would you mind
driving out to Kennedy with me

198
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:02,795
to pick up this famous ecologist
for Marshall's fund-raiser?

199
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,978
Apparently, he only speaks Spanish.
And you speak Spanish, right?

200
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,257
Perfect. Let's go.

201
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:16,239
Marshall, it's me.

202
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:19,604
Listen, I know I've been
kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB.

203
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,661
I just wanted
to call and say I'm sorry.

204
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,955
No apologies necessary.
We're good.

205
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:25,314
Good.

206
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,589
Any chance you might...

207
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,544
Maybe, I don't know... if you're
not busy, wanna have lunch today?

208
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,256
Buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.

209
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:35,690
That's cool.
No biggie.

210
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,810
Another time.

211
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,035
- How long have you been there?
- You don't remember?

212
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,327
I was in the neighborhood.
I just wanted to check in on you.

213
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,626
You seemed
really upset the other day.

214
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,054
No, I'm fine.

215
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,381
Well, you wanna go grab some lunch?

216
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,721
Sure.

217
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:19,427
You okay if I invite Marshall
to join us?

218
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:23,702
Right.

219
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:25,974
So...

220
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,602
Chinese?

221
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:35,540
Just because we are a different
kind of couple than you

222
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,194
doesn't make us a worse couple.

223
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,319
You're right.

224
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:44,523
If you and Zoey are happy,
then who am I to judge?

225
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:46,029
I'm so sorry.

226
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,938
Oh, my God,
is that how support feels?

227
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:53,635
It's so warm and wonderful.

228
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,253
I've been so unhappy.

229
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,924
But I thought
you liked being challenged.

230
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,920
Nobody likes being challenged!

231
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:04,003
Couldn't she agree with me just once,
even on something little,

232
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:07,316
like what movie to see
or what topping to get on our pizza

233
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:11,437
or... I don't know, my lifelong dream of
building a skyscraper in New York City?!

234
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:14,802
In her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted?

235
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:16,277
What are you, 12?

236
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:18,877
You were right, Lily.

237
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,802
I mean, Zoey's great, but,

238
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:24,677
sometimes I do wish we were
a little more like you and Marshall.

239
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,538
There he is. Here we go.

240
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,125
I'm sorry.
I don't speak

241
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,969
whatever it is you're speaking.

242
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:47,807
- He speaks perfect English.
- Yeah, I know.

243
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,851
Why did you ask me to come?

244
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,437
So you can drive him
to the fund-raiser.

245
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:57,218
Supporting Marshall this much
is driving me crazy.

246
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,559
I'm going to Spain.
My flight leaves in 45 minutes.

247
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,331
<i>Adios, muchacho.</i>

248
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:10,536
Wait, what do you mean
you're going to Spain?

249
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:13,052
You were right.
If I hear myself say

250
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:15,431
"Baby, you have my full support"
one more time,

251
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:17,458
I swear I'm gonna murder someone!

252
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:21,885
What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh?
And when are you coming back?

253
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,857
I honestly haven't thought it all
the way through, and I don't intend to.

254
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,804
All I know is that
I'm a ticking time bomb,

255
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,220
and if I don't do something for me,
right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!

256
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:36,589
That's an evocative metaphor to use

257
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:38,981
for your nonthreatening,
totally patriotic emotions.

258
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:42,109
USA!
Okay, Lily, I get it.

259
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,127
Marshall's been asking a lot lately.

260
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:46,738
But the thing to do
is tell him you've had enough.

261
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:48,534
I've never been good at that.

262
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,809
And now, ever since his dad died,

263
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:55,038
I feel like it's my job to just
be fine with everything. But I'm not.

264
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:58,663
I'm not fine that he volunteers
our apartment for a giant fund-raiser

265
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,905
and that he's not thinking about
how we're gonna pay any of our bills

266
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,879
and that, apparently, we've

267
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:05,799
given up on trying to have kids.

268
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:11,476
I'm sorry, Ted, I just,
I gotta do this.

269
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:14,974
My bag?

270
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,186
No. I got it.

271
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:23,124
- There's nothing to talk about.
- You trashed your office today.

272
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:26,094
You obviously have some deep feelings
you're not confronting.

273
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:27,863
And I think they're about your dad.

274
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,191
- I don't wanna talk about it, okay?
- Why not?

275
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:32,831
Because I don't.
And why am I explaining this to you?

276
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,246
You're the most secretive one I know.
You never tell anybody anything.

277
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,084
I've never...
told anyone this before.

278
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:45,239
I was 16.

279
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:49,422
I was awakened around midnight

280
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:53,373
by the sound of my father
arguing with his business partner,

281
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:55,057
Andy Grenier.

282
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,138
As things grew heated...

283
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,698
I watched my father's hand

284
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:04,566
slowly coil around the heavy
antique clock on his desk.

285
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:10,072
The sun was just starting to rise

286
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:13,434
over the bramble orchard
as we packed the fresh earth down

287
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,244
with the flats of our shovels.

288
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:19,275
My dad and I
got our stories straight.

289
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,200
We walked back to the house
in silence and...

290
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:25,091
haven't talked about it since.

291
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:28,249
But sometimes...

292
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:30,832
on a still night...

293
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,719
you can still hear that clock,

294
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,309
ticking...

295
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,046
ticking...

296
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:38,559
ticking.

297
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:42,053
That's...

298
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,110
the most harrowing story
I've ever heard.

299
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,651
Is it true?

300
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:52,614
But it did get you
to drink three scotches,

301
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,242
which is why
you're ready to spill your guts.

302
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:56,409
Fine!

303
00:15:57,243 --> 00:16:00,687
The reason I'm upset
about Marshall leaving GNB

304
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:01,813
is...

305
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:04,215
is...

306
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,757
The meatball sub.

307
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,151
It all started months ago
in the GNB commissary.

308
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:17,222
It was Meatball Sub Day.

309
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,797
<i>How I used to love Meatball Sub Day.</i>

310
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:25,022
<i>And then, the most
humiliating moment of my life.</i>

311
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:29,151
Buddy, I think you got a tiny little
bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.

312
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,671
<i>I plotted my revenge for weeks.</i>

313
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,886
<i>But nothing seemed right.</i>

314
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:41,261
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

315
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,493
<i>The answer was
so elegant and simple...</i>

316
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:50,653
<i>an exploding meatball sub.</i>

317
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,650
<i>For months, I experimented.</i>

318
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:11,126
More... marinara sauce.

319
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:14,868
<i>Finally, the sub was perfected.</i>

320
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:18,426
<i>The plan was in place.
The snare was baited.</i>

321
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:21,078
<i>And then...</i>

322
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:23,705
he quit, Robin, he quit!

323
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,293
It's Meatball Sub Day
today, which is why

324
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:29,044
I wanted Marshall to come over
and have lunch. But no.

325
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,636
All that work wasted.

326
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:37,112
You want to make God laugh,
tell him your plans, right?

327
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:41,368
What is wrong with you?

328
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,525
- Thank you so much for coming.
- My pleasure.

329
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,691
I have to use the restroom.
Do you have some extra invitations?

330
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:52,879
Right over there.
Enjoy.

331
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,280
- Thanks for picking him up.
- Absolutely. Listen,

332
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:59,991
something happened at the airport...

333
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:01,368
- What?
- Well,

334
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:03,036
we got there, and Lily...

335
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:07,666
Sorry, I...

336
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:10,669
I had to park
and grab some ice. Sorry.

337
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,630
Thanks, babe.

338
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:15,119
You would not believe
how much this one has done

339
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,592
to help throw this party.
I don't know how she does it.

340
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:20,178
Can't be easy, huh, Lil?

341
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,892
Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I need
to talk to you about something.

342
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:27,383
No, you know what?
Me, too.

343
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,314
I wanna thank you for being
so supportive of me in all this.

344
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:34,410
I've been at the NRDC
for less than a week,

345
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:37,574
and I've already done more to be
proud of than in two years at GNB.

346
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,656
I can't believe how good it feels.

347
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:44,828
But now, it's time for me
to find a way to help the Earth

348
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:48,623
and get paid for it, because
I can't put that burden entirely on you.

349
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:50,083
So, starting tomorrow,

350
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,587
I'll look for something with a paycheck.
What do you think?

351
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,506
Baby, you have my full support.

352
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:03,889
What are you doing here?

353
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:06,308
I came to show my support
to Marshall.

354
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:08,393
This you can be supportive of?!

355
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,228
What is that supposed to mean?

356
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:13,594
I have the chance to build a skyscraper
in the best city on Earth,

357
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,860
and who's the one leading the charge
to kill that dream? My girlfriend!

358
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:19,564
What about my lifelong
dream of not seeing

359
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:22,199
every beautiful building
in Manhattan bulldozed?

360
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:25,349
<i>And in that moment, I realized,
though I really cared about Zoey,</i>

361
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:27,452
<i>I couldn't do this
for the next 50 years.</i>

362
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:28,997
<i>I had to break up with her.</i>

363
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,830
<i>But then...</i>

364
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:41,533
<i>Kids, some couples
always support each other,</i>

365
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,115
<i>and some couples
always challenge each other,</i>

366
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,790
<i>but is one really
better than the other?</i>

367
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:49,409
<i>Yes.
Support is better.</i>

368
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:50,584
<i>Way better.</i>

369
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:53,259
<i>But I'd have
to learn that the hard way.</i>

370
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:59,282
You're too young.
This isn't fair.

371
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,487
We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're
gonna stay here right till the end.

372
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,153
Thank you, Marshall.

373
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:10,370
Can I ask one final favor, my friend?

374
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:13,123
Yes, of course, of course, anything.

375
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,811
Eat this meatball sub.

376
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:21,386
- Where'd you get a meatball...
- I don't have much time!

377
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,632
Yes, of course.

378
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:24,467
Of course.

379
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,722
Does this have some sort
of special meaning?

380
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:38,857
I'm not sick, you idiots!

381
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:42,143
I've racked up $30,000
of uninsured medical bills

382
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:44,066
for symptoms I don't even have.

383
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,770
Totally worth it!
You should see the look on your face.

384
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:50,467
Wait, you can't... 'cause
it's covered in marinara sauce!

385
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:57,250
Barney, you got a little
marinara on your pajamas.
