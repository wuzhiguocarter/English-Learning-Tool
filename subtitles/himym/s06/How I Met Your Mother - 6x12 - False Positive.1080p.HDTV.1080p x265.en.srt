00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:03,214
<i>In December of 2010,
my friends and I decided</i>

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,924
<i>to go see It's a Wonderful Life
on the big screen.</i>

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,757
<i>It seemed like something
we all needed.</i>

4
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:12,552
<i>After all, it had been a crazy
couple of days. It all started...</i>

5
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:14,664
<i>with a pregnancy test.</i>

6
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:18,141
Is this taking forever?
Are you sure you did it right?

7
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:20,521
Is there a wrong way
to pee on a stick?

8
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:24,586
Can I ask you a question
that's plagued me for years?

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,774
Can girls aim?

10
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:27,780
Can boys aim?

11
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,870
'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking
a mop to that bathroom floor

12
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,322
every two days.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,659
The Far Side calendar you put up
over the toilet make me laugh each time.

14
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:39,865
It's been two minutes.

15
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:45,669
One, two, three.

16
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,147
- It's positive.
- It's positive?

17
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,547
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,974
I've never seen
that woman before in my life!

19
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,185
Sorry. Force of habit.
Congratulations!

20
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:05,810
To Lily and Marshall.

21
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:07,482
Thank you.

22
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:09,542
We've never been happier.

23
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:12,153
Can't imagine anything
bringing me down right now.

24
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:13,914
You're not pregnant.

25
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:15,896
That did it.

31
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:33,846
<i>Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours</i>
we all thought Lily was pregnant,</i>

32
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,261
<i>and how it caused each of us
to reexamine our own lives.</i>

33
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:39,222
- <i>Because while this was happening...</i>
- You did it right?

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,975
<i>I was on the phone with Punchy,
my best friend from high school,</i>

35
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,185
<i>who had recently asked me
to be his best man.</i>

36
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:47,605
I've given this some serious thought.
I think I know how we can crush

37
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:49,114
<i>these floral arrangements.</i>

38
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,859
Here it comes.
Hit me up, Schmos!

39
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,694
Peonies, lavender blossoms

40
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,374
with a halo of baby's breath

41
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,849
for an ambiance
of springtime rejuvenation.

42
00:01:57,974 --> 00:01:58,992
Crushed it!

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,370
That's exactly the accent of whimsy
this celebration of love needs!

44
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,239
It's gonna be a magical day.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,343
I know what you're thinking.

46
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:08,960
I wish I was a dude.

47
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,602
I do wish you were a dude.

48
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,382
Because if I was a dude, I could
have Ted Mosby as my best man.

49
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,884
No, and here's why.

50
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,520
The best man's job is not to crush

51
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:21,347
the floral arrangements.

52
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,892
It's to get the groom
down the aisle, because,

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,894
no matter who he is,
he will freak out.

54
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:28,946
And I don't think you have
what it takes to get that soldier

55
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,399
to pick up his rifle
and charge up the hill.

56
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,640
Are you forgetting
I've done this before?

57
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:36,112
- I was Marshall's best man.
- And how did that go again?

58
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,117
0 for one.

59
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,994
Come on.
That wasn't my fault.

60
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,580
And need I remind you,
I gave a beautiful toast.

61
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:51,461
0 do you take one
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

62
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,213
Oh, God, I'm freaking out.

63
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:56,549
Why did I chose Ted
to be my best man?

64
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:58,792
It's hard to take criticism

65
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:02,430
from someone who recorded seven episodes
of <i>Million Dollar Heads or Tails.</i>

66
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:06,100
<i>Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails
was an extremely popular show</i>

67
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:07,811
<i>with an extremely simple premise.</i>

68
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:09,813
Your practice flip came up

69
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:11,025
tails,

70
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,981
but our Vegas oddsmaker tells us

71
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:15,693
that the next toss
is still just 50-50.

72
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,237
And so, Jordan,

73
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,030
for one million dollars...

74
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,375
Heads...

75
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:22,784
or tails?

76
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,498
What was the year of the coin again?

77
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,721
Why this obsession
with <i>Heads or Tails</i>?

78
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,129
It turns out that <i>Heads or Tails</i>
has a job opening.

79
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:37,423
Heads.

80
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:39,801
Marni, flip that coin.

81
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,698
So now, because of that incident,
<i>Heads or Tails</i> is looking

82
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:48,184
for a new
currency rotation specialist.

83
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,644
You mean coin flip bimbo?

84
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,354
They're not bimbos!

85
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,190
You auditioned, didn't you?

86
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,779
And you're Canadian?

87
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,474
Robin, aside from that coin,

88
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,932
this is the other thing
that's flipping right now.

89
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,328
What is my lid?

90
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:08,691
For you.

91
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,291
You're the new coin flip bimbo?

92
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,084
Currency rotation specialist.

93
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,505
You better check yourself
before you "Trebek" yourself.

94
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,508
You're a journalist!

95
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,651
It's a national audience!

96
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,429
I get to wear shiny dresses!

97
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,056
Have you forgotten
about your New Year's resolution?

98
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:30,470
I am never drinking again.

99
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,228
Before that.

100
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,775
I am gonna finish
this whole bottle tonight.

101
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,067
Before that, too.

102
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:39,694
I moved here

103
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,072
to work for a big-time cable
news channel like World Wide News.

104
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:47,034
By this time next year,
I will be wearing

105
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,787
a World Wide News I.D. badge
around my neck.

106
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,791
And to show you that I'm serious,

107
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,083
this is my first
and only drink of the night.

108
00:04:57,977 --> 00:04:59,372
Oh, damn, that's smooth.

109
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,717
I thought you finally got that interview
at World Wide News.

110
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,671
I did, but they only
offered me a boring,

111
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:07,902
low-paid, off-camera research job.

112
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:10,600
Which could be a stepping stone
in your career.

113
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,352
So could <i>Heads or Tails.</i>

114
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:14,934
The first currency
rotation specialist

115
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:17,732
went on to be a semi-finalist
on <i>The Bachelor</i>,

116
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,629
and then, she lost a hundred pounds
on <i>The Biggest Loser</i>,

117
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,988
and now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

118
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:26,959
<i>It seemed like there was
no changing Robin's mind.</i>

119
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:29,339
<i>But what we didn't realize was,
in a few minutes,</i>

120
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:31,913
<i>our world was going
to be turned upside down.</i>

121
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:34,204
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

122
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:37,700
<i>Now, kids, when your friends
have great news, you're happy for them.</i>

123
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:39,298
<i>For, like, a millisecond.</i>

124
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,508
<i>And then you start thinking
about yourself.</i>

125
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,132
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

126
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,916
<i>They're really having a baby.</i>

127
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:47,187
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

128
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,354
<i>Starting Monday, I'm a rotation spe...</i>
Who am I kidding?</i>

129
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,142
<i>I'm a coin flip bimbo,</i>
and <i>I'm still single.</i>

130
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,885
<i>Let's not go there, Scherbatsky.
That's a whole other thing.</i>

131
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:58,445
<i>I've got to take
that World Wide News job.</i>

132
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:01,651
<i>And so, the next night,
we had two things to celebrate.</i>

133
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,278
Well, you are looking at the new

134
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:06,899
associate researcher
at World Wide News.

135
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,783
Oh, my gosh.
That's amazing.

136
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:10,540
What changed your mind?

137
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:15,623
I just realized that I am about to have
a little niece who looks up to me.

138
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:17,839
And I don't want to be
sad aunt Robin,

139
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:20,201
the aging coin flip bimbo
who gives her the creeps.

140
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:22,496
I want to be cool aunt Robin,

141
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:24,590
the respected journalist,
who gives her beer.

142
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:26,058
- What?
- What?

143
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,805
I have never seen you guys
looking so at peace.

144
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,441
To Lily and Marshall.

145
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:35,226
Thank you.

146
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,055
We've never been happier.

147
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,614
<i>So the next day Robin called
Heads or Tails to respectfully decline.</i>

148
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,513
Hi, Mr. Trebek.
This is Robin Scherbatsky.

149
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,487
- <i>But at that moment...</i>
- You're not pregnant.

150
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,074
As honored as I am by the offer...

151
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,953
FAUSSE ALERTE.
PAS ENCEINTE.

152
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,413
<i>They're not having a baby.</i>

153
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,684
<i>What am I getting all up
in my head about?</i>

154
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,854
<i>That research job sounds hard.</i>

155
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:02,284
<i>And I'm pretty.</i>

156
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:05,053
<i>I'm really, really pretty.</i>

157
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,820
You are looking
at the new coin flip bimbo.

158
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:20,230
You took the heads or tails job?

159
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,871
What about World Wide News,
your ID badge?

160
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,985
You made a New Year's resolution.

161
00:07:27,153 --> 00:07:30,571
Okay, I also said I would never
make out with a garbage man.

162
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:33,569
Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans.

163
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,243
What's with the gingerbread house?

164
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,197
We're seeing a Christmas movie.

165
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,790
It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.

166
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,125
Let's hope Santa brings you
a girlfriend this year.

167
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:45,443
Where the hell is Barney?

168
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,714
<i>Where was Barney?</i>
<i>Let's back up again.</i>

169
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:49,926
<i>You see, while this was going on...</i>

170
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,051
It's positive.

171
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,302
<i>This was happening.</i>

172
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,222
And now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

173
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:57,724
Hey, guys.

174
00:07:58,188 --> 00:07:59,588
A yuletide riddle.

175
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,855
What is my second favorite word
that begins with b-o-n?

176
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,288
What is my third favorite word
that begins with b-o-n?

177
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:11,321
Bonus.

178
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:14,700
As in, my end-of-the-year
bonus check.

179
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,643
My God, Barney!

180
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:19,359
I work for GNB, too.

181
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:21,748
All I got was $15 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

182
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,083
You earned it, buddy.

183
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:26,706
Check out
what I'm gonna buy for myself.

184
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,588
The dibiase.

185
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:30,800
See those pinstripes?

186
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:31,925
Diamonds.

187
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:35,220
It is the uppest
a person could ever suit.

188
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:38,473
Has it ever occurred to you
to give some of this to charity?

189
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:41,456
Charity? You're seriously
talking to me about charity?

190
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:43,231
Dude, I am Mr. Charity.

191
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:47,023
I frequently sleep with sixes,

192
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,713
chubsters, over-thirties...

193
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:54,114
I am the Bill and Melinda Gates
of the sympathy bang.

194
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,060
Hey, guys.

195
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:59,251
- Big announcement.
- Let me guess.

196
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,912
You got a huge bonus check, too.

197
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,998
No, just a $30 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

198
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,082
Thirty?!

199
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,420
- I'm pregnant.
- What?!

200
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,503
I've never seen that woman
before in my life!

201
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:11,423
Sorry, force of habit.
Congratulations!

202
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,848
<i>Marshall and Lily are
doing something meaningful.</i>

203
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,873
<i>And it's making me
less happy about this bonus.</i>

204
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,520
<i>And I'm still single.</i>

205
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,517
<i>At least I got</i> <i>that going for me.</i>

206
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,823
<i>So why do I still feel outside
of awesome looking in?</i>

207
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,898
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

208
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:30,895
We've never been happier.

209
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,278
I can't imagine anything
bringing me down right now.

210
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,114
You only think you're happy.

211
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,616
Just wait, because tonight,

212
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,827
is Barney's Favorite Things!

213
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,795
<i>That was the reaction
Barney expected.</i>

214
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,173
<i>This was the one he got.</i>

215
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:57,594
- I don't know what that is.
- Barney's Favorite Things!

216
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:01,056
I'm gonna give you all a bunch
of free stuff... like Oprah.

217
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,308
Just get excited, okay?

218
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:05,526
<i>The next hour got pretty weird.</i>

219
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,771
Velour track suits!

220
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,965
- Velour is so comfortable.
- They're so soft.

221
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,198
Remote control helicopters!

222
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:17,334
Condoms!

223
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:22,327
And last but not least...

224
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,330
There is a fleet of limos outside

225
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:27,707
waiting to take us to...

226
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:31,000
a strip club!

227
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,565
You get a lap dance!
You get a lap dance!

228
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,416
You're gonna give me a lap dance!

229
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:41,684
Everybody gets a lap dance!

230
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,183
That was amazing!

231
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:47,269
It was like a diamond suit
for my soul.

232
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:49,363
I gotta keep going.
I gotta do more.

233
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:51,439
I cannot go back to that strip club.

234
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:53,853
I seen some things.

235
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:56,155
I'm not going back either.

236
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,330
I'm taking the rest of my bonus

237
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,070
to God's strip club.

238
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:03,493
<i>The next day, he paid a visit
to the most charitable man he knew,</i>

239
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:07,205
<i>his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs,</i>
<i>a minister at a church on Long Island.</i>

240
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:08,665
Sam.

241
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,883
Father.

242
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,886
I don't mean father father.

243
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,920
- Unless...
- What's up, Barney?

244
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,507
I'm thinking about
giving some money to charity.

245
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:20,473
Is that the name of the stripper
you've been e-mailing me about?

246
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,540
You gotta take me off that list.

247
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:25,283
No, I don't mean that charity.

248
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:27,358
That charity is doing peachy.

249
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:29,436
You'll see pics
in next week's e-mail.

250
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:30,770
What up!

251
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,551
I'm a minister.

252
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,017
Unsubscribe.

253
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,068
I recently started giving, and,

254
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:38,968
it felt surprisingly good.

255
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,406
- I wanna do more.
- Well, now you're talking.

256
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,282
We have this program that helps those
in need get back on their feet.

257
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:47,821
We give them food, a place to live,

258
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:49,456
clothes for job interviews.

259
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:51,424
Well, I would love to help

260
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:53,172
by writing a check

261
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,673
for... one...

262
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:59,257
zero, zero, zero...

263
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,056
You're not pregnant.

264
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:02,709
Zero...

265
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,261
Hold on a second.

266
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:11,290
<i>Wait. They're not doing something
meaningful with their lives.</i>

267
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,459
<i>This changes everything.</i>

268
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,586
<i>I've already written four zeroes.</i>

269
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,587
<i>Thank you, decimal point.</i>

270
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,843
One hundred dollars.

271
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:26,787
That's great!

272
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,578
Thank you, Barney!

273
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:35,377
Diamond suited up.

274
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:40,173
Ted, can you spot me for the movie?
I don't like to carry a lot of cash.

275
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,143
What happened
to giving the money away?

276
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,700
That was back when Lily was pregnant.
Now she's not.

277
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:53,173
Ergo, a suit is born.

278
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,938
Dude, what's up with the gingerbread
house? You look ridiculous!

279
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,982
It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!

280
00:12:59,774 --> 00:13:01,124
I know that move.

281
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,175
You cut a hole in the floor,

282
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,603
she reaches into the
living room, finds the tree...

283
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,909
<i>Holly night.</i>
Nice.

284
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:12,264
Where the hell
are Marshall and Lily?

285
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,955
<i>Let's back up one last time.</i>

286
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,399
- I'm pregnant.
- What?!

287
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:18,794
I've never seen that
woman before in my life!

288
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:21,711
Sorry, force of habit.
Congratulations!

289
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:23,176
<i>This is great.</i>

290
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:24,301
<i>I'm happy.</i>

291
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,644
<i>I'm so happy, my heart's pounding.</i>

292
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,017
<i>And I'm sweating.</i>

293
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,619
<i>And I can't breathe.</i>

294
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,848
<i>This is what happiness
feels like, right?</i>

295
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:34,859
<i>Crap. Lily's having a baby
and I'm having a panic attack.</i>

296
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:36,978
<i>I hope she can't tell
what I'm thinking right now.</i>

297
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,146
<i>I can.</i>

298
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,981
<i>And I'm freaking out, too!</i>

299
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:43,485
<i>There's an alien growing in my stomach
that's gonna explode out of my vagina!</i>

300
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,278
<i>Do you think the others can tell?</i>

301
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,573
- <i>What am I doing with my life?</i>
- <i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

302
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,035
<i>I should get a Christmas-themed
movie snack for tomorrow night.</i>

303
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:54,246
<i>They're totally onto us.
What do we do?</i>

304
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:55,831
<i>Just keep smiling, maybe wave.</i>

305
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:58,131
<i>No, don't wave!
That makes no sense!</i>

306
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:00,710
<i>I'm committed.</i>
<i>I'm riding this wave straight to hell.</i>

307
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:03,126
<i>Let's leave,
then the waving will make sense.</i>

308
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:05,856
<i>So Marshall and Lily headed home.</i>

309
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,425
Lily, we have to relax.

310
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:08,969
There's no need to panic.

311
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:11,542
There's a lot to do,
but we've got nine months to prepare.

312
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,524
So I say that we just make a list
of everything that needs to get done

313
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,310
before the baby arrives
and do everything on that list tonight!

314
00:14:17,478 --> 00:14:18,578
Let's do it!

315
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:22,082
Got it.
Okay, that seems easy.

316
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,900
Nursery's painted!

317
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,485
Blue? What if it's a girl?

318
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:26,653
Damn it!

319
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:43,253
God, it's 8:00! We're supposed to meet
the gang at the bar to celebrate.

320
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:46,594
God. Okay, listen. When we meet them,
we have to keep it together.

321
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,176
- Can you keep it together?!
- No, I can't keep it together!

322
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,422
I have never seen you
guys looking so at peace.

323
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,064
To Lily and Marshall.

324
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,361
Well, thank you. I mean,

325
00:14:57,941 --> 00:14:59,691
we've never been happier.

326
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:03,023
This is a nightmare!
We've done everything wrong!

327
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,735
The iPod was on shuffle!

328
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:11,072
The Jerky Boys!
Our baby heard the Jerky Boys!

329
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,532
The Jerky Boys are funny.

330
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,160
The Jerky Boys aren't funny,
they are awful.

331
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,412
Fine, if you don't think
the Jerky Boys are funny,

332
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,789
I'm not sure I can
raise a child with you, liver lips.

333
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:23,210
I don't like this.

334
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:26,087
I know. Okay? I don't like it either.
It's like I have

335
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,255
a hot,

336
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,770
burning

337
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,618
ball of stress in my chest,

338
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:33,553
and nothing will make it go away!

339
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:36,421
- You're not pregnant.
- Well, that did it.

340
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,601
I know this probably comes
as quite a disappointment.

341
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,319
Huge bummer.

342
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,143
So disappointing.

343
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,906
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. Why wouldn't we be?

344
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:55,339
The baby thing.

345
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:58,078
Yeah, whatever.
Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice.

346
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,025
Don't reach into the living room!

347
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:05,585
I thought you guys
would be devastated.

348
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:09,422
You know, we're actually
kind of relieved.

349
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:12,118
We were freaking out for about
a day and a half there.

350
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:15,869
This whole thing got us thinking. Maybe
we're not ready for kids yet after all.

351
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,973
Wwe were thinking maybe
we would just get a dog.

352
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,308
- Get a puppy!
- Can you imagine...

353
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:22,435
That would be the cutest thing!

354
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,189
Our movie snack.

355
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,108
Are you kidding me?!

356
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:30,344
All you ever talk about
is having kids!

357
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:33,754
And now you have one little freak-out
and you want to get a dog instead?!

358
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,449
Unacceptable!
You're gonna turn around,

359
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:38,551
you're gonna go home, get naked,

360
00:16:38,676 --> 00:16:41,354
lie together as man and wife
until Lily is great with child.

361
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:42,788
Right now!

362
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:44,582
I'm serious! Go, go, go!

363
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,462
Marshall and Lily got in trouble.

364
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,630
And you!

365
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,425
You look real stupid in that suit.

366
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:56,232
You're gonna go get your money
back and give it to charity.

367
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:58,764
And I don't mean that stripper
you keep e-mailing us about,

368
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,889
even though we beg you
to take us off that list.

369
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:02,782
I can't give this suit back.

370
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:06,521
Ted, I glow in the dark.
I finally glow in the dark!

371
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:09,725
Criminals of New York! Attention!

372
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,152
This man is wearing a
diamond-covered suit!

373
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:14,321
You could retire on the pants alone!

374
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,411
Merry Christmas!

375
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:23,163
So, if I get a large popcorn,
you want to go split-skees or...

376
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:24,331
And you...

377
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,777
You did not move
to the greatest city on earth

378
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:29,461
to become a coin-flipping bimbo.

379
00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:31,225
So here's how it's gonna work:

380
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,651
Heads, you take the job
at World Wide News.

381
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,717
Tails, you take
the job at World Wide News.

382
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,346
Hey, looks like
somebody got a new gig!

383
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:43,525
Fine, I'll call them tomorrow.
I'll call them right now.

384
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,773
- I can't get married!
- Yes, you can! You love her!

385
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,232
You're right, I do! Thanks!

386
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:02,035
One for <i>It's a Wonderful Life,</i>
please.

387
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:05,808
Thank you.

388
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:19,386
We're idiots.

389
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:21,137
This kid doesn't stand a chance.

390
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:26,309
- We're ready for this.
- We're ready for this.

391
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,718
That's a lot of zeroes.

392
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,068
You sure you're not
missing a decimal point?

393
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,204
And that's the tour.

394
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:40,824
Staff meeting's at noon,
you'll meet everyone there, but,

395
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:44,243
first you need to head down to security.
You need to get your picture taken.

396
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:45,745
For your ID badge.

397
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:52,293
You sure?

398
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:54,254
Positive.

399
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,855
And there's more. Do you still do that
thing where you give people in need

400
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,595
- clothes for job interviews?
- Why?

401
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,658
Bring 'em in, boys!

402
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:15,357
Merry Christmas.

403
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,236
- Thank you, son.
- Son?!

404
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:20,786
It's just an expression.
I'm still not your dad.

405
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:31,291
Congratulations.

406
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:33,460
You know, that was
really cool what you did.

407
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:37,429
When we all needed it,
you got us back on the right path.

408
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,394
It's what I do.

409
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:43,636
If I ever get married
and you're not the guy I'm marrying...

410
00:19:43,804 --> 00:19:45,138
Big mistake, but go on.

411
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,892
I could really use someone like you.

412
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:50,810
You know, in case I freak out.
When I freak out.

413
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:51,978
You interested?

414
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,231
Are you asking what I
think you're asking?

415
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,187
Ted, will you be my best man?

416
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,096
Scherbatsky...

417
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,489
I'm gonna crush it.

418
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:13,172
Hi, there.

419
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,002
We've had a lot of fun tonight, but,
on a more serious note,

420
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:19,013
this is the time of year when
we remember the importance of giving.

421
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:21,091
And there's no greater gift

422
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:22,579
than the gift of booty.

423
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,119
So, this holiday season,

424
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:27,685
why not bang someone in need?

425
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:30,474
I'm Barney Stinson, and that's...

426
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:32,198
one to grow on.

427
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,554
Hi, there. You know,
we've had a lot of fun tonight...
