1
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:04,476
<i>Kids, this is a story of landmarks.</i>

2
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:06,661
<i>There are certain moments in</i>
<i>life when you have to decide</i>

3
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:08,930
<i>which things you can stand</i>
<i>to see torn down,</i>

4
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:11,833
<i>and which things you have</i>
<i>to preserve, no matter what.</i>

5
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:14,068
<i>Such a moment came</i>
<i>for all of us</i>

6
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:17,639
<i>in May of 2011,</i>
<i>at a special meeting of the</i>

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,240
<i>New York City Landmarks</i>
<i>Preservation Commission,</i>

8
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:20,274
where the fate of The Arcadian

9
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:21,776
<i>would be decided</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

10
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:25,246
A symbol of strength
and constancy,

11
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:26,714
the stone lion of The Arcadian

12
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,450
has watched over
New Yorkers for generations.

13
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:30,618
So remember:

14
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,088
if the lion head stonework
is regal,

15
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:38,226
then tearing it down
should be illegal.

16
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,094
Well...

17
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:42,063
Did you like that?
All right, uh...

18
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:45,266
We must make sure
the lion is always there.

19
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:49,971
Destroy The Arcadian?
Oh, no, don't you dare.

20
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:54,809
Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

21
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,177
Try this one on for size...

22
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:59,714
If you want New York's history
at your beck and call...

23
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:01,683
All right, thank you,
Mr. Eriksen.

24
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,001
I just have...

25
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,873
We will now hear from the architect

26
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:10,625
of the proposed GNB Tower,

27
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:13,127
Ted Mosby.

28
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:15,897
Now, uh,

29
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:18,599
Mr. Mosby, let's just
cut right to the chase.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,269
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

31
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:35,399
Okay, it's killing me. What
rhymes with "beck and call?"

32
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,585
Wrecking ball.

33
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:39,454
Don't go swinging
no wrecking ball.

34
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:42,206
Ah...

35
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:44,025
Thank you.

38
00:01:56,755 --> 00:01:58,973
Mr. Mosby,

39
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:01,576
do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

40
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,910
It's not a difficult question.

41
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,046
<i>Actually, it</i> was
<i>a difficult question.</i>

42
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:07,448
<i>Of course, had he asked me</i>
<i>a few days earlier,</i>

43
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,383
<i>I would have</i>
<i>immediately said...</i>

44
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:12,270
"Yes. The Arcadian
should be a landmark."

45
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,655
And then the crowd
"Oh, my God!

46
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,990
"Did he really
just say that?

47
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:17,258
"Oh, heavens!

48
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,493
"Oh, my stars!

49
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:20,361
I must clutch
my pearls!"

50
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:23,598
So these things are generally
attended by old Southern ladies?

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,666
Almost exclusively.
But here's my point:

52
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:29,370
If they ask GNB's chief
architect-- aka me--

53
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:32,540
if The Arcadian should be a
landmark, and I say "yes"?

54
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:37,812
That, no, that wasn't The
Arcadian being destroyed;

55
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:39,964
that was GNB's hopes of
destroying The Arcadian.

56
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,186
I'm sorry, I should
have been more clear.

57
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:42,017
Yeah.

58
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,925
The Arcadian's gonna
be all like...

59
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,587
Nice.

60
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:48,189
I have a message from Barney.

61
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,690
<i>Things between Barney</i>

62
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,760
<i>and the rest of us</i>
<i>had gotten a little frosty.</i>

63
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:54,428
<i>First this happened.</i>

64
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:58,166
Meet the new lawyer I hired
to help save The Arcadian.

65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,301
<i>And then this happened.</i>

66
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,203
What kind of dirtbag

67
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:05,139
doesn't stand by his best
friends, but instead,

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,842
sides with some
self-righteous bitch

69
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:10,028
with a pointless cause
and a megaphone?!

70
00:03:10,112 --> 00:03:12,046
Dude!
That's my girlfriend.

71
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,081
And ya know what?

72
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:17,018
I'm on her side now, too.

73
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,719
<i>Which led to this happening.</i>

74
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,721
Message from Barney?
That's my cue to leave.

75
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,106
Good night, guys.

76
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:24,392
- I love you.
- Mmm. Love you, too.

77
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:25,860
Good night.
Good night.

78
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:27,028
All right,
what's the message?

79
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,296
'Cause if it's another
hypothetical

80
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,898
yet eerily accurate
drawing of my boobs ( . ) ( . )

81
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:34,268
Yeah, I have that, too.

82
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:36,671
Damn it.

83
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:39,440
All right, here's the message.

84
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,009
"Oh, hey, guys.
Didn't see you there.

85
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,645
"I was too busy
feelin' fine and..."

86
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:46,614
Really?

87
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:53,120
"Feelin' fine
and gettin' some 'jine."

88
00:03:54,223 --> 00:03:56,390
"You may have
noticed the giant plate

89
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,342
"of hot wings in front of me.

90
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:00,294
"I know how much
you love hot wings.

91
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:01,996
"Too bad someone
bribed the kitchen

92
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:03,931
"to take them
off the menu tonight.

93
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,216
"So, if you want some,

94
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:08,603
"you're going to have
to come back to GNB.

95
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:10,037
"But hurry, this offer

96
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:12,506
will be gone lickety-split."

97
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,946
"Do evil laugh."

98
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:20,248
Oh, um...

99
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:25,870
So, what are you turds up to?

100
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:28,890
Oh, we've got the big
LPC meeting in two days.

101
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,524
I have my whole
presentation worked out.

102
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,927
I just need to find a
good rhyme to end on.

103
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:33,995
Why does it need to rhyme?

104
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:34,995
Mm.

105
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:37,565
If you end an argument
with a rhyme,

106
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:39,799
it's convincing <i>all</i> the time.
Yeah.

107
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,202
It's why in
our apartment:

108
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:43,204
If you're a-hopin'
to score,

109
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,106
don't leave your socks
on the floor.

110
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:46,941
And she hasn't since.
No.

111
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,943
Okay, okay.
A couple of things.

112
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:50,578
Lily, how'd I do?
Nailed it.

113
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:52,914
Secondly, Ted,

114
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,865
I'm sorry I said
mean things about Zoey.

115
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,551
Are you really going to walk
away from this project

116
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,753
just because you're mad at me?

117
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:00,788
It's not because
I'm mad at you.

118
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:03,057
Barney, The Arcadian
was designed

119
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:04,592
by a guy named
John Clifford Larrabee.

120
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:06,560
And even though he's been dead
for half a century,

121
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,913
it's my duty,
architect to architect,

122
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:10,031
to keep his work alive.

123
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,934
Please tell me a little
part of you understands.

124
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:15,136
I understand.

125
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:18,606
Zoey has magic lady bits.
What?

126
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,741
Zoey's lady bits...

127
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,577
are magic, and that's
how she controls your mind.

128
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:26,113
You see,
every few hundred millennia,

129
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:28,215
lady bits leap forward...
I know

130
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:29,450
you're only just
getting started,

131
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:31,319
but this is
already gross.

132
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,055
I once knew such a girl.

133
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,424
<i>It was last call.</i>

134
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:37,725
<i>In this very bar.</i>

135
00:05:41,363 --> 00:05:44,098
What...?!

136
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,767
No...

137
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:49,503
What?!

138
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:51,672
No...

139
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:54,241
What?!

140
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:56,377
Um...

141
00:05:56,378 --> 00:06:00,581
thank you for, um, not using
a first name in that story.

142
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:05,619
Barney, this is
about the building.

143
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,855
Come on. This is so
about the girl.

144
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:10,324
Okay, fine.
It's about the girl!

145
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,426
I am doing this for Zoey!

146
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:13,761
I'm in love with her.

147
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:17,198
Look, I know it's early,
but there's a very good chance

148
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,183
Zoey might be the mother
of my children.

149
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:22,003
So, in addition to doing this
for John Clifford Larrabee,

150
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:24,021
I'm also doing this
for Luke and Leia.

151
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:26,941
Wait. She's gonna let you
name your kids Luke and Leia?

152
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:28,909
Not if I knock down her favorite
building, she isn't.

153
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,310
Barney, I'm sorry.

154
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:32,697
Oh, you're not sorry now,
Ted Mosby.

155
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:34,482
But you will be.

156
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:38,586
You... will... be.

157
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,143
That's how you do an evil laugh.

158
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,928
<i>Ciao</i> for now.

159
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:51,065
<i>Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs,</i>

160
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,434
<i>Barney and Marshall's</i>
<i>old boss at GNB?</i>

161
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:55,803
Well, Arthur was going through
<i>a divorce and taking it</i>

162
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,071
<i>kind of hard.</i>
Hi, Arthur.

163
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:59,573
Everything okay?

164
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:01,308
No, everything's not okay.

165
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:04,745
My stupid wife got
custody of Tugboat.

166
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:06,147
God, I should have
kept her hidden

167
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:08,149
in a cage in the basement.

168
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,084
Isn't that animal cruelty?

169
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:11,986
I'm talking about my wife.

170
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:14,422
Oh. That's fine, then.

171
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:19,133
So listen, you know Ted,
the architect?

172
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:20,861
Yeah, I know your friend Ted.
So,

173
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:23,164
if Ted stood up at
that big meeting tomorrow

174
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:26,700
and said that he thought The
Arcadian <i>should</i> be a landmark...

175
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,936
you wouldn't just fire him,
would you?

176
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,872
Right?

177
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:33,240
You wouldn't just...

178
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:34,375
You wouldn't just... yeah...

179
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:36,844
No, Barney.
I wouldn't <i>just</i> fire him.

180
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,046
I'd also fire you.

181
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,949
Come again for Big Fudge?

182
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:49,957
Can you believe that?!
I can't be unemployed, Robin!

183
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:52,598
My job is my identity;
It's who I am.

184
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,600
It gives me
the confidence I need

185
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:57,003
to convince girls
I'm a fighter pilot.

186
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,871
I-I don't understand.

187
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,673
Why would he fire <i>you?</i>

188
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:01,974
I don't understand.

189
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:03,175
Why would you fire me?

190
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:05,544
Have you already forgotten
how Mosby got that job?

191
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:08,581
By being
the best architect available?

192
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:10,182
No.

193
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:13,185
By... being Latino?

194
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,322
No. Let me refresh your memory.

195
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:18,190
We were in this very room.

196
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:20,226
Guys, I'm telling you,

197
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:24,397
if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic,
fire me.

198
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:26,132
Damn it!

199
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,533
I was kidding?

200
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:28,868
I'm not kidding!

201
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:30,803
Oh, by the way, Arthur,

202
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:32,171
uh, how are things
with you and your wife?

203
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:33,339
Really good.

204
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,374
In fact, I just put
all my assets in her name.

205
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,310
Smartest thing I've ever done.

206
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,011
Damn it!
No,

207
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,647
you'd better make sure Mosby
doesn't screw up tomorrow.

208
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,616
Because either
that building is going down,

209
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:45,952
or <i>you're</i> going down.

210
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:47,386
<i>They're going</i>

211
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:48,955
to fire him? That sucks.
He loves that job.

212
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:52,191
And he's been doing it
for years.

213
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:54,360
Okay, what does Barney
do at GNB?

214
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,629
No idea.
He has a lot of keys.

215
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,731
Okay, Ted, can you just please
think about this before you...

216
00:08:58,732 --> 00:08:59,865
There's nothing to think about.

217
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,267
I-I can't lose Zoey.

218
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:03,035
That's the only thing
that matters to me right now.

219
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,403
Okay, Ted...

220
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:05,838
you know I love Zoey.

221
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,474
But, look, sometimes...

222
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:09,909
I go play chess in the park.

223
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,877
And the key to chess...

224
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:14,380
Okay, I play online.

225
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:17,383
But the key to chess...
Okay, it's Angry Birds!

226
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:19,719
But the key to Angry Birds

227
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,089
is to always try to see
every possible outcome.

228
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,157
And to... hit some pigs
with rocks or something.

229
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:27,827
I don't know; I don't play.
I can't get it to download.

230
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,330
The point is,
this thing with you and Zoey?

231
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:34,066
I can see it going
three possible ways.

232
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:35,634
There's the first scenario.

233
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,203
<i>The chairman asks you...</i>

234
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,127
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

235
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,473
<i>You say...</i>
No.

236
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:42,051
And Zoey dumps you on the spot.

237
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,777
We're done here.

238
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:46,479
There's the second scenario.

239
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,047
<i>The chairman asks you...</i>

240
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,891
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

241
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,372
<i>You say...</i>
Yes

242
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,456
<i>And you're happy</i>
<i>for, like, a second,</i>

243
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:55,755
until you realize the building
<i>you helped save</i>

244
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:57,056
<i>has just become a monument</i>

245
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:58,491
<i>to everything</i>
<i>this woman made you give up,</i>

246
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,759
<i>and you resent her for it,</i>

247
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,795
<i>so much so, in fact,</i>
<i>that</i> you <i>dump</i> her.

248
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:03,996
We're done here.

249
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,870
You said there was
a third scenario.

250
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,033
Right.

251
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:08,467
<i>The chairman asks you...</i>

252
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,903
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

253
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,988
<i>But before you can answer...</i>

254
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,324
<i>You're hit in the neck with</i>
<i>a blow dart fired by the ninja</i>

255
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,877
<i>Zoey's ex-husband hired</i>
<i>to assassinate you.</i>

256
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,115
That one's less likely.

257
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,818
What I'm saying...

258
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:28,154
what I hate saying...

259
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:30,656
is this.

260
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:32,591
You and Zoey are gonna break up.

261
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,027
But you can still
save your career

262
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:36,362
and Barney's.

263
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,731
Okay, first of all,

264
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,533
no ninja's getting a jump on me.

265
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:43,903
I have the reflexes
of a jungle...

266
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,371
Tree?

267
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:48,074
Second of all,

268
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:50,176
I don't care that the odds
are stacked against us.

269
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:52,311
I'd rather try
to make this work with Zoey

270
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:55,414
than spend the rest of my life
alone playing Angry Birds,

271
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:56,582
which, by the way, I've shown
you how to download,

272
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,751
like, 20 times.
I've got to say,

273
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:00,186
I'm with Ted on this.

274
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:01,420
Thank you.
I mean, yes,

275
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,739
this is a huge,
divisive issue for them.

276
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,691
Which means
no matter what happens,

277
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:07,927
there's gonna be
a lot of resentment.

278
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,195
Probably lasting

279
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:10,729
for years...

280
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,101
infecting every single moment of
the rest of their relationship.

281
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:18,003
So, in conclusion,
I'm with Robin on this.

282
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,772
Thank you.

283
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:21,340
<i>That night,</i>

284
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,576
<i>as I slept soundly...</i>

285
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,285
Barney, what are you doing?

286
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,454
Who is this Barney?

287
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,740
My name is
John Clifford Larrabee,

288
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,792
architect of The Arcadian.

289
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:40,793
And I am

290
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:42,027
visiting you

291
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:44,730
in a dream...

292
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,932
Really? 'Cause it feels
more like my insane friend

293
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,201
renting a costume
and breaking into my apartment

294
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:50,669
in the middle of the night

295
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,372
for what I wish
I could say was the first time.

296
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:54,874
Look, it's a dream, it is.

297
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,076
So just... okay?

298
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,546
Theodore...

299
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,281
heed my words:

300
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:05,885
do not try to save
The Arcadian.

301
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:07,186
Barney, there's condoms
in the drawer.

302
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,437
Just take them and get out.

303
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,656
I am not

304
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:11,941
Barney...

305
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:14,960
Whoa! Lighting change!

306
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:19,665
Theodore, you know The Arcadian
is a badly built,

307
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,568
architecturally unimportant
rat's nest

308
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:25,371
designed by an overpaid,
plagiarizing ether addict

309
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:27,039
with two thumbs.

310
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,008
This guy.

311
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,443
Okay, yes,
it's-it's a terrible building,

312
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:34,580
but... does that mean
we have to knock it down?

313
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:36,749
I mean, it's
not bothering anyone.

314
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,018
Just anyone who lives in it.

315
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,920
Or looks at it.

316
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,588
Or smells it.

317
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,091
New York is never finished,
Theodore.

318
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,560
She's a lady

319
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,596
only a handful of architects
ever get to dance with.

320
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:51,964
Do not miss

321
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,933
your turn.

322
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,871
The Arcadian has to go,
doesn't it?

323
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:00,072
Indeed.

324
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:03,609
You realize this kind of
screws up my personal life.

325
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,111
Mo' buildings, mo' problems.

326
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:11,116
This is a dream, right?

327
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:13,752
Because, Barney, I swear to God,
if that's you...

328
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:21,894
Mommy's got
Magic Lady Bits, Ted.

329
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:24,563
Dream! Dream!

330
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,332
It was just a dream.

331
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:36,308
? ?

332
00:13:45,518 --> 00:13:48,554
Hey. I know it's late,
but, uh...

333
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:50,823
you want to meet up?

334
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,092
Hello, Mr. Lion.

335
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,727
"Look on my works,

336
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:58,430
ye mighty, and despair""

337
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:02,568
Hey, I met you right...

338
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,256
...here.

339
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:08,958
Right. And I mistook you

340
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,759
for a prostitute right...

341
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,711
here.

342
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:14,380
As far as you know,
I still could be one.

343
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:15,414
Ah.
And you,

344
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,800
my good man, have
run up quite a tab.

345
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,923
Worth every penny.

346
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,360
All right...

347
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,812
this was fun.

348
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm gonna take this cab.

349
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:36,101
Big day tomorrow.

350
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:38,070
We need to get some sleep.

351
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:44,843
And yet...

352
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:47,613
No, we should get some sleep.

353
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:49,748
But this was fun.

354
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:51,116
Yeah.

355
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:52,951
It's nice getting one last look

356
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:54,987
to remember what
we're trying to save.

357
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:58,324
Exactly.

358
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,359
You okay?

359
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,227
Yeah. Good night.

360
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:06,999
<i>Mr. Mosby, I'm going</i>
<i>to ask you one last time.</i>

361
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,601
<i>Should The Arcadian</i>
<i>be a landmark?</i>

362
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:14,073
No, it shouldn't be a landmark.

363
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,041
There are a lot

364
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,743
of important buildings
in New York.

365
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:19,545
The Arcadian isn't one of them.

366
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:25,351
E-Excuse me,

367
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:26,985
I have a question for Mr. Mosby.

368
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:28,370
If he doesn't think

369
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:32,291
The Arcadian's worth saving,
then whose voice is this?

370
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:34,893
TED
The Arcadian should be a landmark.

371
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,328
It should.

372
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,365
The lion head stonework
is iconic.

373
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:41,600
I hate working for GNB.

374
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,835
They're a bunch of...

375
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,837
wieners and gonads.

376
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:46,872
Oh, heavens!

377
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:48,574
My stars!

378
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:50,476
Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?

379
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:57,483
Yeah, that's me.

380
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:04,391
This is a nightmare.
I can't believe

381
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,455
she kept that tape.

382
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:06,423
The LPC's gonna

383
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,091
come back with a decision
tomorrow,

384
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,359
and based on today...

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,127
They're gonna landmark
the hell out of that place.

386
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:13,463
Yeah. We'll end up
out of a job,

387
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:18,068
all thanks to some stupid,
only sort of awesome lion head.

388
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,870
Better get used
to that lion head.

389
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:23,807
As of tomorrow, it's gonna be
there till the end of times.

390
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:26,643
And all because
of my sweet, sweet rhymes.

391
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:30,414
What are we gonna do?

392
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:35,986
We should buy a bar.
We should totally buy a bar!

393
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,654
We should absolutely
totally buy a bar!

394
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,323
It's really the only
sensible idea right now.

395
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,624
Oh, oh, and ready?

396
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,992
It's a theme bar.

397
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,026
Mm!

398
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:44,061
It's a courtroom.

399
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:46,113
Yes!
Ah!

400
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:49,299
Where the bartenders
wear sexy judges' robes.

401
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,934
I'll allow it!

402
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:53,337
The only court where you
show up, <i>then</i> get served.

403
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,337
Ho!

404
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:56,607
You're judged by a jury
of your beers.

405
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,524
That's not bad.

406
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:58,542
Just stop it!

407
00:16:58,543 --> 00:16:59,610
No one's buying a bar.

408
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,195
Right now we have
a little problem.

409
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:03,013
Let's just think
of a solution.

410
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:04,982
Lily, it's over.

411
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,650
The good guys lost.

412
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,319
I don't know, homegirl
is pretty diabolical.

413
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,389
If there is a plan
that'll get us out of this,

414
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,492
it's somewhere
inside this butter churn.

415
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,628
She'll think of it.

416
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,430
I'm just gonna sit here...

417
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:22,382
and watch it happen.

418
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,470
And she's got it!

419
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,055
Lily, what's the plan?

420
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,707
Oh, this ought to be good.

421
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,843
And then Lily told us her plan.

422
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,846
Oh, this is <i>good!</i>

423
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,781
We have to find
Arthur right now.

424
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,352
What is so difficult
about this?!

425
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,054
Tugboat figured this out
in, like, five minutes.

426
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:45,789
This is bush league!

427
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,057
Hey, Arthur!

428
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:49,059
Oh, cute dog!

429
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,862
No! Tugboat, my other dog,
that was a cute dog.

430
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,365
This little <i>disappointment</i> is
nothing but a cheap facsimile.

431
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,633
I said it!

432
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:58,235
Yeah, my love is
reserved for dogs

433
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,103
that go to the bathroom
on command

434
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:02,105
instead of wasting my time!

435
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:04,942
Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife

436
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:08,779
has an idea for how we can
save <i>not saving</i> The Arcadian.

437
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,130
Oh, his wife has an idea.

438
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,715
Let me tell you
about wives, okay?

439
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,134
They leave you and take
your best friend with them.

440
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,385
You're not Tugboat!

441
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,955
You'll never be Tugboat!

442
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:22,059
Uh...

443
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,426
Hey, Arthur?

444
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:34,621
I guess this one's
kind of cute or whatever.

445
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:38,575
So... so what's the idea?

446
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,545
Okay, first hear
my demands. One,

447
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:43,947
Ted and Barney
keep their jobs.

448
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,650
Two, when you guys do finally
blow up The Arcadian,

449
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,752
one of them gets
to push the button.

450
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,754
Dibs.
Dibs.

451
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,673
Fine! What's the idea?

452
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,524
Well...
<i>Kids, for legal reasons,</i>

453
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,560
<i>I have to skip</i>
<i>this part of the story</i>

454
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,295
<i>and jump ahead</i>
<i>to the next night,</i>

455
00:18:58,296 --> 00:18:59,796
<i>as the Landmarks</i>
<i>Preservation Commission</i>

456
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:01,031
<i>gave their verdict.</i>

457
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:02,032
Last night,

458
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,700
this committee took a vote,

459
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:07,337
and while we have all felt
from the very beginning that

460
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:08,705
The Arcadian is,

461
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:11,341
well, an eyesore...

462
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:14,544
Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony

463
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:16,613
<i>about the lion's head</i>
<i>stonework</i>

464
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,549
<i>left us no choice</i>
<i>but to declare it...</i>

465
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,284
a landmark.

466
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,759
But then, something else
happened last night.

467
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,794
<i>That same lion's head</i>

468
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,995
stonework...

469
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:35,866
...disappeared.

470
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,435
So...

471
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:41,138
that makes our job
a little easier.

472
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,839
Motion denied.

473
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,617
Zoey...

474
00:19:53,618 --> 00:19:54,851
Zoey!

475
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,622
All right, what do you have
to say for yourself?

476
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:01,625
I don't know.

477
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:05,062
Sometimes... things
have to fall apart

478
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:08,265
to make way for better things.

479
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:18,909
We're done here.
