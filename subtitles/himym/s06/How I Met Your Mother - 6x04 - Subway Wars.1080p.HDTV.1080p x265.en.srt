1
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:04,754
I cannot stop
staring at that girl's face.

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:05,922
Face.

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:08,424
That's your weirdest nickname
for boobs yet.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,761
I'm really looking at her face.

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,221
That's actually really sweet.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,010
Puffy cheeks,

7
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:17,569
smudged mascara,

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,685
slightly red nose...

9
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:21,479
That girl was just crying.

10
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,772
She's so sad

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,240
and defenseless.

12
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:26,167
Anyone have a condom?

13
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:31,197
That's it! You know what?
Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.

14
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,451
Get this. You know
my friend Max from law school?

15
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:37,741
He's
at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown,

16
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,665
and Woody Allen
is sitting two tables over.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,248
He wants us to come check it out.

18
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,878
I don't know, it could be cool.
I've never seen Woody Allen.

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,946
What?! How can you be a New Yorker
and never have seen Woody Allen?

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,881
I have seen plenty
of other famous people.

21
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:54,622
Last week I saw...

22
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,389
Maury Povich.

23
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:59,151
<i>Kids, you know talk
show host Maury Povich.</i>

24
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:01,759
<i>It was uncanny
how often we saw this guy.</i>

25
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,356
- Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.
- Maury Povich is everywhere.

26
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,818
I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real
New Yorker till you've seen Woody Allen.

27
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,820
I am, too, a real New Yorker.

28
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,288
That's adorable.

29
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:13,823
You're from Canada.

30
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,992
I've been here for almost six years.
It's not like I just got off a boat.

31
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:18,331
A boat!

32
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,725
Wait, that is how you say it.

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,400
I'd say you're not a real New Yorker

34
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,000
till you've stolen a cab from someone
who needs it more than you.

35
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,838
You're not a real New Yorker
till you've cried on the subway

36
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,832
and not given a damn
what anyone thinks.

37
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:33,426
You're not a real New Yorker till you've
killed a cockroach with your bare hands.

38
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:37,562
Those rules are all stupid, okay?
I've never done any of those things.

39
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:41,016
<i>By the end of this day, Robin
would have done all of those things.</i>

40
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,107
Okay, time's up.
What are we talking about?

41
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:46,689
Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's,
and Robin thinks we should go see him.

42
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,300
Why would I do that?
I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.

43
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:51,979
Come on, if we jump in a cab,
we'll be there in 15 minutes.

44
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,255
A real New Yorker knows
the subway's faster.

45
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,073
Take the 1, and transfer to the 2-3.

46
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,618
The bus runs more often on weekends.
Take the M-7 to the M-5.

47
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,082
The bus? Every time I take the bus,

48
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,527
there is one crazy person
no one wants to sit near.

49
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:07,474
That's why
I have never taken the bus.

50
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,421
Plus...
I can run faster than a bus.

51
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,103
Dude, that's, like, seven miles.

52
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:14,341
You can't do that.

53
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,844
- You can't beat the bus!
- I can beat

54
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,472
a bus or a cab or a train!

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,431
Is anyone else suddenly
craving green eggs and ham?

56
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,936
Machines are overrated, and someone
needs to take them down a peg.

57
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,402
You're all wrong... I got a way to get
there so fast, I could beat all of you,

58
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,190
even if I sat down and ordered

59
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:33,380
- a big, juicy steak first.
- How?

60
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,593
Medium rare.
But that's not important right now.

61
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,740
I know the city better
than any of you guys.

62
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,605
All right, all right,
hold on, hold on!

63
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,250
Let's just forget about it.

64
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,751
Who cares? I mean, there's no way
to find out who's right anyway.

65
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:55,127
- First person there wins!
- Doesn't matter how you get there!

66
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:56,634
Stay sad! I'll be back!

71
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:25,955
Can I see a menu, please?

72
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:27,357
No rush.

73
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:34,344
<i>Kids, I should tell you,</i>

74
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:36,340
<i>Lily really needed a win that day.</i>

75
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,836
<i>When Marshall and Lily
decided to have a baby,</i>

76
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,881
<i>they assumed
it would happen right away.</i>

77
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,957
It's gonna be positive.
Eriksen man are hella fertile.

78
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:48,458
When Uncle Morris was 16,
he got his girlfriend pregnant

79
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,400
just by holding her hand too
tight in the backseat of a car.

80
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:53,975
Now I'm thinking
my parents lied to me.

81
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,394
It's negative.

82
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,363
<i>As the weeks went by,
Marshall's confidence never wavered.</i>

83
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,574
<i>And it started to mess
with Lily's head.</i>

84
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,239
Negative?

85
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,828
We know it's not me.

86
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,814
Everything's fine.

87
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:10,583
These things take time.

88
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,104
Not with an Eriksen.

89
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,732
Something must be wrong with you.

90
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:17,798
Also, my mom hates you.

91
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:20,038
You know what?

92
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,854
Just to make sure,
I'm gonna pee on this again.

93
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,597
What?
No, you wouldn't.

94
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,973
Somebody help me!

95
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,515
Somebody help me!

96
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,659
<i>Lily was so fed up
with not getting anywhere,</i>

97
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:34,940
<i>maybe winning this race
was just what she needed.</i>

98
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,267
Idiot!

99
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,540
<i>I'll show them.</i>

100
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,057
<i>My body can outrun
any motorized vehicle.</i>

101
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,907
<i>I'm like John Henry
when he beat the steam engine.</i>

102
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,846
<i>All I need is a great folk song.</i>

103
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,971
<i>Gather round, ye children</i>

104
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:09,308
<i>To hear the tale so sweet</i>

105
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,537
<i>Of a man who dared to race machines</i>

106
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:13,272
<i>With nothing but his feet</i>

107
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,631
Suck it, grand-butt!

108
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,835
<i>Marshall</i>

109
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,209
<i>Versus the machines</i>

110
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,114
Taxi!

111
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,157
Excuse me, I got a thing.

112
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,661
Track maintenance?

113
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,426
20-minute delay?

114
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,573
- How do you do that?
- I grew up here, I speak conductor.

115
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:48,722
Damn it!

116
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,255
Damn it!

117
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:03,070
<i>Kids, I also needed a win that day.</i>

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,093
<i>A couple nights earlier,
your Uncle Marshall</i>

119
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:09,159
<i>had offhandedly mentioned
a Web site called...</i>

120
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:10,953
Grademyteacher.net?

121
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,855
It's this site where students can go say
what they think about their professors.

122
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,291
You're probably on there.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,214
<i>I just had to see what my students
had written about me.</i>

124
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,533
<i>And it was...</i>

125
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,185
<i>majestic.</i>

126
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:32,316
<i>Until...</i>

127
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,856
<i>Now, kids, I knew
I was a good professor.</i>

128
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,489
<i>That's why I didn't let it bother me.
I had nothing to prove.</i>

129
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,064
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

130
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,171
Here's a fun fact.

131
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,288
See the Alberta Building over there?

132
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:50,701
The brown one or the gray one?

133
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,385
That's the gray one.
Did you know that in 18...

134
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,054
Come on!

135
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:24,748
Somebody call an ambulance!

136
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,721
Excuse me, I've got a thing.

137
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,532
- That's my cab!
- Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.

138
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:38,916
This is my cab!

139
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:44,449
Downtown hospital, please.
It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse.

140
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:47,011
Take the FDR, and maybe
crank up some smooth jazz.

141
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,911
We're required by law to take you
to the nearest hospital,

142
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,685
which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt.

143
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,810
Uptown.

144
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,642
It's Barney.
Help me.

145
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,743
<i>Robin also needed a win that day.</i>

146
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,789
<i>It had been a rough year for Robin.</i>

147
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:23,041
<i>First her boyfriend
and former cohost, Don,</i>

148
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,518
<i>left her for another job.</i>

149
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:26,819
<i>Then Robin met
her new cohost, Becky.</i>

150
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,839
Hi! I'm Becky!

151
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,048
I am so excited to be your coanchor!

152
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:36,304
Hi, Becky.
My, you're perky.

153
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:39,975
Don't worry, I am not here
to step on your toesies.

154
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,394
You're still the star.

155
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:45,345
I made chocolate chip cookies
for everybody!

156
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:50,384
<i>And just like that,
Becky started to eclipse Robin.</i>

157
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:52,755
<i>I mean, literally eclipse her.</i>

158
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:58,918
This is my cab!

159
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,567
Keep it.

160
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,572
Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.

161
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:15,347
Taking you to Gregor's.

162
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:19,862
<i>As Marshall ran with all his might
and passed his friend Christine</i>

163
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,895
<i>He thought of all the times
that he had beaten the machine</i>

164
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:27,351
<i>He triumphed over "Pitfall"</i>

165
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,583
<i>He vanquished the alarm</i>

166
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:36,340
<i>He brought the jukebox
back to life with his Fonzarelli arm</i>

167
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,076
<i>Marshall</i>

168
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:44,414
<i>Versus the machines</i>

169
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,748
Last seat.
Thank God.

170
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,575
I just had the worst cab ride
of my life.

171
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,583
Well, you're in luck.

172
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:56,758
See that gothic church over there?

173
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:59,844
Those Corinthian columns were
designed by Giuseppe Pegatto

174
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,106
in 1896.

175
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,094
Ranjit, pull over.

176
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,369
Pulling over.

177
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:10,979
Hey, toots!
How about a ride?

178
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,297
Hey, Robin, it's you.

179
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:20,921
<i>Move along!</i>

180
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:25,797
<i>Move along!</i>

181
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,335
See that over there?
That's the old Arcadian Hotel.

182
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,720
Fun fact...

183
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:34,756
While today its neoclassical
fenestration is considered to be...

184
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:41,674
So, is this ride your way
of apologizing for this morning?

185
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,473
I'm sorry.
I never apologize.

186
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,434
- And why would I?
- Are you kidding me?

187
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,063
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

188
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,525
Stand a little more this way.
I'm scouting some talent.

189
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,694
Pretend we're talking
about something important.

190
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,113
Well, this is something important.

191
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:01,479
I'm having
a really rough time at work,

192
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:02,993
the whole Becky thing...

193
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:06,367
That's just getting distracting.
Say "carrots and peas."

194
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,214
Guys, I can't stop staring
at that girl's face.

195
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:18,925
What, you really had something
to talk about?

196
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,886
I've spent the last
six years in this city,

197
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,804
focusing on my career,
all for nothing.

198
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:27,475
Some lady almost got me killed.
Maury Povich stole my cab.

199
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,438
I swear, this city is starting to
reject me like a bad organ transplant.

200
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:35,412
Everyone keeps saying
that I'm not a real New Yorker.

201
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:37,485
Maybe I should just stop trying.

202
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,154
Robin, I had no idea.

203
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:41,508
It's my fault for thinking
that you might care.

204
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,034
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.

205
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,703
- Don't stop the car.
- Not stopping the car.

206
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,539
- Seriously, stop the car.
- Seriously stopping the car.

207
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:52,083
Look, you...
Wait, Robin, hold on.

208
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,419
If you want to talk, I'm right here.

209
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,254
Carrots and peas.

210
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:57,991
Don't...

211
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:04,086
I'll crank up the smooth jazz.

212
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,060
<i>Our hero's strength
was fading fast</i>

213
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,312
<i>Just as the light turns...</i>

214
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:20,964
<i>Green</i>

215
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:23,516
<i>He then thought back
to all the times</i>

216
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:26,284
<i>He'd lost to a machine</i>

217
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:29,229
Come on, Playboy Channel.

218
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:31,498
<i>The cable box is fearsome</i>

219
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,968
<i>But the stapler's mighty sting</i>

220
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:37,416
Come on, Spice Channel.

221
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,483
<i>The cable box's bite again</i>

222
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:45,262
<i>Getting too tired</i>

223
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:48,640
<i>To sing</i>

224
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:59,391
<i>Kids, that day, I had
a horrible realization.</i>

225
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:02,320
<i>If you can't spot the crazy
person on the bus...</i>

226
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:06,533
<i>it's you.</i>

227
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,459
<i>The good news is, I was halfway there
and nothing could stop me.</i>

228
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:27,929
- This is crazy.
- I can't believe it.

229
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:29,822
This is clearly a sign.

230
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,905
Let's just call it a tie.

231
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,018
Forget about the race.
Head back to the bar.

232
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:47,535
<i>Just like that,
the race was back on.</i>

233
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,144
Idiot.

234
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:54,706
<i>Meanwhile, one subway car over...</i>

235
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:20,649
Bite me!

236
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:27,155
Faster.
Mush! Mush!

237
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,699
I need this win.
I need this win.

238
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:35,776
And firing half my department
freed up the money to double my salary.

239
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:38,632
And this chick from Boston
was wicked hot in bed last night,

240
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:41,501
and I'm getting more muscular
even though I've stopped working out,

241
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:43,528
and I've got
this amazing poker group.

242
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,894
<i>Actually, Barney did not need a win.</i>

243
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,219
And I smell incredible.

244
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:49,768
Smell me.

245
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,569
Seriously, smell me.

246
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,143
<i>He did smell incredible.</i>

247
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,304
Too slow.
Switch.

248
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:16,477
Sweetie?

249
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,120
Are you okay?

250
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,498
I am done with this city.
It wins.

251
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:24,834
I just want to move somewhere new
and start over.

252
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:28,174
You've had a rough year.

253
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,911
But you're tough.

254
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,028
And I love you like crazy.

255
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:34,097
If you left, I'd have to follow you.

256
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:37,340
And Marshall would follow me.
And Ted would follow him.

257
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:40,228
The only upside
is that we might get rid of Barney.

258
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,345
Bring it in.

259
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:48,069
What did he say?

260
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,816
No clue.

261
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:52,197
Is that Maury Povich?

262
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:01,254
Sorry, I swear I'll be a great friend
at the finish line,

263
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,493
but the conductor just said
you're going express to Borough Hall,

264
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,087
which means you're screwed.

265
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,171
So long, sucker.

266
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:13,094
Bring it in.

267
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Damn it.

268
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,443
It's Lily.
Help me.

269
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:22,538
And not a single passenger
would listen to me.

270
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:24,105
Am I a bad teacher?

271
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:26,273
Do I just put people to sleep?

272
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:29,102
Buddy?

273
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:30,478
Hey, buddy?

274
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:32,113
Need a hand?

275
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,366
The machines have won!

276
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,785
The machines have won.

277
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,120
Dude, mellow.

278
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,167
I can't do it.
I can't run that far.

279
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,216
I can't outrace anything.

280
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:46,341
I can't...

281
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:49,172
I can't get my wife pregnant!

282
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:56,304
Wait. Is that what this whole
stupid running thing has been about?

283
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,384
My body has been letting me down,

284
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,825
and I just wanted to prove
it could still do something,

285
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,976
but it can't.

286
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:05,772
You've been trying for two months,
not two years, that's nothing.

287
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,240
You should talk.

288
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:10,551
You're the one who's freaking out
because you have one mediocre review

289
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,153
and, like, 50 great ones.

290
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,671
64, but whatever.

291
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,045
And you're designing
a fricking building.

292
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,370
Come on, dude.

293
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,583
Sounds like you guys
need to clear everything,

294
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:23,007
subtract the negativity,

295
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:25,643
and add some perspective.

296
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:32,757
Get in!

297
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:53,653
- There it is.
- Where are Marshall and Lily?

298
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:54,976
Who cares?

299
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:21,639
I won?
I won!

300
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:25,164
I can't believe it!
How did that even happen?

301
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:26,561
<i>Here's how it happened.</i>

302
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:29,731
- He's in. Go. Go. Gun it.
- Ted's in the way.

303
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,357
- Run him over.
- Running him over.

304
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:33,151
What the hell
is the matter with you?

305
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,682
Nothing.
I just want to win this really badly.

306
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:40,405
So badly that I just ditched Robin
when she needed me.

307
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,129
You were also gonna run over Ted.

308
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:47,623
Why did I get so crazy about this?

309
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,491
Maybe for the same reason
I kept saying I could run seven miles.

310
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:56,112
I'm trying to be really
confident and positive about this, but,

311
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm really scared
we're not pregnant yet.

312
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,472
I keep thinking
there's something wrong with me.

313
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,098
I keep thinking the same.

314
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:06,218
- It's only been two months.
- We are crazy.

315
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,345
- We're totally crazy.
- This is the last time

316
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,272
it's ever gonna be just the two of us.
Shouldn't we be enjoying that?

317
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:14,901
- We gotta go back to Paris.
- And take ballroom dancing.

318
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:18,321
And really learn how to ski, not just
go up and get faced in the lodge.

319
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:21,144
And see Coney Island.
I've still never been.

320
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,327
We have a whole bucket list
of things to do before having kids.

321
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,373
A cradle list.

322
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:28,991
I'm...

323
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:30,478
so glad we're trying,

324
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,918
and I'm gonna be really excited
for when it happens,

325
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,171
but this isn't a race.

326
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:37,545
This isn't a race.

327
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:40,941
Ranjit, screw Gregor's.

328
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:42,637
Let's go to Coney Island.

329
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:46,431
Screwing Gregor's.
Going to Coney Island.

330
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,851
<i>As for how Robin beat me and Barney,</i>

331
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,979
<i>to this day,
your uncle Barney won't admit it...</i>

332
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,583
<i>But here's what I saw:</i>

333
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,483
<i>I saw Barney notice Robin's face...</i>

334
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,779
<i>and maybe realize something.</i>

335
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:01,701
<i>Barney says he tripped,</i>

336
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,649
<i>but it sure felt
like he tackled me on purpose.</i>

337
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:08,913
<i>And when Robin won,
I could have sworn I saw him smiled.</i>

338
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:16,879
I know what you did back there.

339
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,046
Check it.
I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks,

340
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:26,252
and I still smell incredible.

341
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:27,390
Smell me.

342
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:29,901
- I'm not...
- Smell me.

343
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,367
<i>He did smell incredible.</i>

344
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,273
Wait a minute.
So, where's Woody Allen?

345
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,358
Right there.

346
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,114
