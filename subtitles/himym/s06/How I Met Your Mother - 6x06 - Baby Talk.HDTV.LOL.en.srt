<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, in the fall of 2010,</i>

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:05,314
<i>our friends
Stuart and Claudia had a baby,</i>

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:07,183
<i>and Marshall and Lily
were the first</i>

4
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:08,351
<i>to visit the happy new parents.</i>

5
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:09,719
<i>MARSHALL:
So, have you guys</i>

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,120
landed on a name yet?

7
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,822
We're trying, but it's
tougher than you think.

8
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:14,924
You see, I like "Tiffany."

9
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,859
And I don't want my daughter
to have a whore's name.

10
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,894
That's my mother's name.

11
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,729
I know.

12
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,197
Oh, I got it.

13
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:23,332
How 'bout we name the baby
after you-- "Frigid Shrew."

14
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,567
Oh, that's good.

15
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:25,668
No, no, no, no.

16
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:27,036
Let's call
her "Vodka."

17
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:29,105
Then at least we know
you'd hold her tight

18
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:30,573
and never let her go!

19
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:32,942
Don't knock the vodka.
Wouldn't have a kid without it.

20
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:35,445
(chuckling)
Stuart, you are so...

21
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:36,946
That's not gonna be us, right?

22
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:39,382
I mean, how hard can it be
to name a baby?

23
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,284
Right? I mean, just
look at her. Yeah.

24
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:42,718
She's clearly a...

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,986
Emily.
Lisa.

26
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:45,421
Lisa?!
Emily?!

27
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:47,824
(baby crying)

28
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,359
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

30
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:04,440
Okay!

31
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,309
I made a list of
awesome baby names.

32
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,411
Starting at the top:
number one...

33
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,213
I'm gonna stop you
right here, Marshall.

34
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:13,015
You name
a chubby white kid "LeBron,"

35
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:15,251
and he's the one getting stuffed
in the basketball hoop.

36
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:17,787
Then I'm also crossing off,
um, "Shaquille"...

37
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:18,888
Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:22,124
"Hakeem,"
and "Dikembe."

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
Hey, what about "Rob"?

40
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:25,194
"Rob"?

41
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:26,963
No.
Why not?

42
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:28,731
Hey, Rob. What are
you gonna make?

43
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:29,732
A turkey?

44
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,568
Honka, honka!

45
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,504
(gasps)

46
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,072
Not "Rob."

47
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:38,574
Okay, um, how
about "Ryan"?

48
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,775
TED:
Ooh.

49
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,911
(all screaming)

50
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:45,848
Not "Ryan."

51
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:47,583
"Johnny?"

52
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,852
Hey, where's the goldfish?

53
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,020
(gasps)

54
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:57,627
Not "Johnny."

55
00:01:57,628 --> 00:01:59,695
Or "Gil."

56
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,864
(whimpers)

57
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,467
"Jeremy."

58
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,602
(music playing)

59
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:08,804
Jeremy, no!

60
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,710
Definitely
not "Jeremy."

61
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:16,812
His stuff was
so derivative.

62
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:19,048
Well, I mean,
geez, Lily.

63
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,216
Well, whatever you do,

64
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:22,285
do not name your
baby "Becky," right?

65
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:23,853
Why? What?
What?

66
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:26,789
Becky.
My new co-anchor?

67
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,091
Don't you guys
ever watch the show?

68
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:30,860
Oh, honey, I really try.
Our DVR won't recognize it

69
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:32,428
as a television program.
Mm-hmm.

70
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:34,297
I watched.

71
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,500
Robin insisted I confirm
how "awful" Becky is,

72
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,969
so last night I
checked it out.

73
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,671
Peace talks
in the region

74
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,506
have been described
as, "productive."

75
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:44,707
Becky?

76
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,143
(in baby voice):
Last night, in Staten Island,

77
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,512
a taco cart owner
was robbed at gunpoint.

78
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:51,113
Aww...

79
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:53,149
That's so sad.

80
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,417
Becky,
we're-we're journalists.

81
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:56,285
We can't get emotional
about the news, we...

82
00:02:56,286 --> 00:02:57,587
Oh, no!

83
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,822
They stole all his money
and then pelted him

84
00:02:59,823 --> 00:03:01,023
with his own taco meat!

85
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:02,658
Who would do that?

86
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,261
Well, if you read the story,
we might find out.

87
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,432
Oh, can I do this one,
about the horse?

88
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,866
I love horseys.

89
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,301
Mm-hmm.

90
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:14,670
Aww, the horse died.

91
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:15,972
Guys!

92
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:19,642
This news is
all really sad.

93
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:23,245
Okay, no holds barred--
what'd you think of Becky?

94
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,781
Mmm...

95
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:27,984
(muttering)

96
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:29,685
I thought she was charming.

97
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,020
ROBIN:
You, too?

98
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,722
Can somebody please
explain to me

99
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:34,690
why the little girl act
works on men?

100
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,292
You want the long version
or the short version?

101
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,760
Short version.

102
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,228
Short version.

103
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,763
Who's your daddy?

104
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:41,764
(all groan)

105
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:43,399
You know, when you
think about that,

106
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,401
that phrase
is really creepy.

107
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:47,003
No, it's not.
It's fun.

108
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,404
Here, watch this.

109
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:51,240
Hey, Lily...
Who's your daddy?

110
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:52,708
(laughing)

111
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,210
Okay, uh, let me
get this straight.

112
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,478
So, in, uh,
in this scenario,

113
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,546
because you make such
sweet love to Lily,

114
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:59,248
she is now
your daughter.

115
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:01,117
No, she is not
my daughter.

116
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,853
I'm just her daddy.

117
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,087
Wow. That is disgusting.

118
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:06,922
Exactly. And it's not like
the opposite would work.

119
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:08,958
There's no way a guy
could pick up a girl,

120
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,326
going around talking
like a little boy.

121
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:11,994
Challenge accepted.
No.

122
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,896
I, Barney Stinson,

123
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:17,233
will pick up a girl whilst
talking like a little boy.

124
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:19,101
(all grumbling in protest)

125
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:20,369
Okay.

126
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,537
Here's my list
of baby names.

127
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:22,972
Oh.
What about "Tara"?

128
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:24,140
No.

129
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:25,808
Not "Tara."

130
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,743
Tara was the hottest girl
in my high school.

131
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:29,311
We were all, like,
obsessed with her.

132
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,847
<i>MARSHALL:
We didn't just talk about her</i>

133
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,115
<i>and fantasize about her...</i>

134
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,784

139

What about "Esther"?

140
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:56,272
(rock song plays)

141
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:57,673
ANNOUNCER:

142
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,375
Coming up on the main stage,

00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:01,143
give it up for Esther!

144
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:03,012
Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney.

145
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,214
That prime rib
was surprisingly good,

146
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:06,649
but it's 10:30
in the morning.

147
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,918
I don't need to see
a lady get naked and dance.

148
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,252
Oh, Esther gets naked.

149
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:11,487
But she doesn't dance.

150
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:12,688
Then what does she do?

151
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,290
(blowing up balloon)

152
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:19,595
(balloon pops)

153
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:22,431
Sweet mother nature!

154
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,704

(explosive pop,
men cheering and whistling)

158
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:38,581
Not "Esther."

159
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:41,917
I need a drink.
Ted? Ted?

160
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,957
Marshall, your list
is entirely boy names.

161
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,959
You do realize there's
roughly a 50% chance

162
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,494
of you having
a daughter, right?

163
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,929
Okay, honestly, I've never
thought about having a girl.

164
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,165
I don't want to think
about having a girl.

165
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,600
Tara, Esther--

166
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:59,735
can you imagine being
one of those girls' dads?

167

On the main stage, give it up
for Marshall's daughter.

172
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:18,053
He screwed up
my childhood.

173
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:20,189
That's why
I do this.

174
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,761
I have no idea how
to raise a daughter!

175
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,163
What if she
makes bad choices?

176
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:30,366
I mean, what if
she winds up dating some...

177
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,268
Oh, God.

178
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,870
Papa, I want you to
meet my new boyfriend.

179
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:39,708
Hey, bro.

180
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,111
Thanks for making
such a hottie.

181
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:43,746
(weak laughter)

182
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:44,880
Who's your daddy?

183
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:47,383
You are, 'cause
of all the sex we have.

184
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,819
(Barney chuckles salaciously)

185
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,954
(vomiting)

186
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,389
I don't want a girl.

187
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,723
I just want a little boy.

188
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:57,860
It's not what it
sounds like, folks.

189
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,213
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

190
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,782
JUDY:
Marshall? Is that you?

191
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:07,150
MARSHALL:
Oh, okay, um...

192
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:08,885
You guys, you're a little
too close to the camera.

193
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,286
Can you back up a bit?

194
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,224
How's this?

195
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,759
Every time.

196
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,762
Um, can you just sit
in front of the computer

197
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,263
like normal human beings?

198
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:21,731
Perfect!

199
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,866
Perfect.

200
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,567
What's up, shooter?

201
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,636
Um, to be honest,
I'm getting a little freaked out

202
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,338
about the idea
of having a daughter.

203
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:30,173
I know you two probably
aren't the right people

204
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:32,042
to talk to about this.
You had all boys.

205
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:34,077
Oh, well, that was
just dumb luck.

206
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,681
Hey, honey, would you get me a
brewski from out of the shed?

207
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:39,649
Sure. You want
anything, Marshall?

208
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,217
I'm in a computer, Mom.

209
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:42,352
Oh.

210
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:44,688
Yeah, all boys.

211
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,624
Total co-winky-dink.

212
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,459
It was no co-winky-dink.

213
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,994
Since the Viking age,

214
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:53,730
the Eriksen men have
passed down ancient secrets

215
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:55,231
for conceiving boys.

216
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,834
Number one, avoid lemons.

217
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:00,103
They're baby girl fertilizer.

218
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,838
Okay... No offense, Dad,

219
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,074
but I doubt there's any
scientific data to support--

220
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:07,143
(mocking tone): "I doubt there's
any scientific data to support..""

221
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,678
I had all sons.

222
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,280
Your grandfather
had all sons.

223
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,615
Your great-grandfather
had all sons.

224
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,084
Scoreboard!

225
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:15,919
Who you gonna listen to?

226
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,089
Me? Or "scientific data"?

227
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,025
Members of the G-8

228
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:23,893
convened today in Vienna

229
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,528
to discuss plans to fight

230
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,997
climate change by re-- What?

231
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:29,866
Ask me what I
did yesterday.

232
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:32,001
Hey, Becky, Becky, this is
our news segment, okay?

233
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:33,837
Nobody cares
what you did yesterday.

234
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:35,572
Lighten up, Robin.

235
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,173
(in baby voice):
What'd you do, sweetheart?

236
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:38,575
Mike!

237
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:42,178
Well, I'm new in town
and don't know many people.

238
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,781
But yesterday,
I met the sweetest man,

239
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:47,684
who took me
on a tour of the city.

240
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:50,153
(whispering):
Guys, New York is kind of cool.

241
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,455
Okay, back to the
G-8 conference.

242
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,157
Hello?

243
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,726
Mike, can I get
in the shot?

244
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:59,329
Fantastic.

245
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,397
Then this cutie patootie

246
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,166
took me to this bar
called MacLaren's,

247
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,634
right underneath his apartment.

248
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:06,970
Wait-- did you go out
with Ted Mosby?

249
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,238
Yes!

250
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,007
Guys, I went out
with Robin's roommate.

251
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,243
I saw her bedroom.

252
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:16,412
(whispering):
She's a messy Bessie.

253
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,715
In other news, later today,

254
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:22,018
a Manhattan architect gets
punched in the throat.

255
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,620
Ow!

256
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:25,288
Ted, of all the
women in New York,

257
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:27,690
you had to go out with
an eight-year-old girl?

258
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,559
Not what it sounds like, folks.

259
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,661
Ted, you know that I hate her.

260
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:34,197
How could you go out
on a date with this girl?

261
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,465
It wasn't a date.

262
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,700
She came over to
the apartment looking for you.

263
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:41,070
I made Robin my famous
chocolate chip cookies.

264
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:45,175
But instead of chocolate chips,
I used gummie bears.

265
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:46,342
Aww...

266
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:47,110
(shrieks)

267
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:48,678
A spider!

268
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:53,216
Let me guess: she acted
like a helpless little girl,

269
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,819
and you stepped in
as the big, strong man.

270
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,355
I don't know
if that's totally true.

271
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,394
It's okay, little darlin'.

272
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,563
Poor spider.

273
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,031
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

274
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:14,037
Spiders gotta die
so trees can grow.

275
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:20,710
Then I held her tight and told
her it was all gonna be okay.

276
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,980
By the way, I think
I only wounded the spider.

277
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,448
It crawled off into my bedroom.

278
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,483
Wait. Is that why you slept
on the couch last night?

279
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:30,486
(scoffing):
Yeah, I slept.

280
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,189
I'm dying out here.

281
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,759
Talking like a little boy
is not working with the ladies.

282
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,095
(in childlike voice):
Wow, lady.

283
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,998
You got some tig
ol' bitties!

284
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,701
(stammering)

285
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,302
Gosh!

286
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:48,705
Your body's a perfect...

287
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:50,673
this many.

288
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,109
Hi.

289
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,979
Do you want to wrestle with our
special bathing suit places?

290
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,948
Come on!

291
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,651
Mm, I just need
two seconds, baby.

292
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:03,186
I know you think
that's a compliment,

293
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:04,754
but I'd rather
you took your time.

294
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:07,957
No, um... I'll
be right back.

295
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:19,402
Ancient Norse wisdom
tells us that, to sire a son,

296
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:23,206
you must do three things right
before you lay with your maiden.

297
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:26,109
First, eat pickled herring.

298
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:29,112
Eat it!

299
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,781
This is ridiculous.

300
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:37,320
ANNOUNCER: Gentlemen,
gentlemen, on the main stage,

301
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,888
throwing her life away,

302
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,190
give it up
for Marshall's daughter!

303
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,558
(applause)

304
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,894
(sobbing)

305
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:47,230
Who's your granddaddy?

306
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,399
That guy.

307
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,900
(sobbing)

308
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:56,673
(groans softly)

309
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,808
(gagging)

310
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:01,411
(little boy voice):
Hey, want to have a three-way

311
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,212
with me and my imaginary friend?

312
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:05,748
His name's Otis.

313
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:09,719
Hey, hey, want
to come to my house

314
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
and play telephone?

315
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,022
I got the string;
you got the cans.

316
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,258
(giggles)

317
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,260
I wet myself!

318
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,761
Will you change me?

319
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,931
Can't blame her on that one.

320
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,335
Guys...

321
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:27,537
I have some terrible,
terrible news.

322
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,973
I, Barney Stinson,

323
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:34,243
can't pick up a girl whilst
talking like a little boy.

324
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,212
Challenge forfeited.

325
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,647
(high-pitched gasp)

326
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,083
Yeah, we don't care about
this... No one challenged you,

327
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,284
so it wasn't really a challenge.

328
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:42,852
(sobs)

329
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,520
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

330
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:47,390
MAN: Hey, Gerard,
what's with that shirt?

331
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,559
Nobody could pick up
a chick wearing that thing.

332
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,427
Challenge accept...

333
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,730
(sobs)

334
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,499
Wow, I'm glad that's over.

335
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,435
It was creepy watching Barney
talk like a little kid.

336
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,704
Oh, but you find it irresistible
when Becky does?

337
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,106
I don't get it.

338
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:06,175
The Ted that I went out with was
attracted to the kind of woman

339
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,011
who could use a steak knife
without supervision.

340
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:10,346
For your information,
Becky doesn't like steak,

341
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,514
she likes pasghetti.

342
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:12,749
Spaghetti.

343
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,284
And more importantly,
she makes me feel needed.

344
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:16,386
Needed? (scoffs)

345
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:18,721
She makes
training wheels feel needed.

346
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:21,090
Hey, it's nice to feel needed.
And you know what?

347
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,693
It's not a feeling guys get
when they're with you.

348
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:29,532
(groans weakly)

349
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:30,967
Son...

350
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:34,504
Viking lore tells us
that to ensure the continuation

351
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:36,873
of your noble male lineage...

352
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:39,175
get a big old bowl of ice

353
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:41,944
and dunk your man sack
right in there!

354
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:42,945
(laughing)

355
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:44,914
You two and
your football.

356
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,789
(sighs)
Okay.

357
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:56,492
Mm-hmm.

358
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:57,493
(chuckles)

359
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,128
(ice cubes clack)

360
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,498
(screaming)

361
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:05,735
Now get in there,
point Lily due north

362
00:14:05,736 --> 00:14:08,204
and make me a grandson!

363
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,640
Eriksen!

364
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,575
Eriksen!

365
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,143
(crying)

366
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:24,854
When we were dating, I...
I didn't make you feel needed?

367
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:28,157
Come on! You always
took charge of everything.

368
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,159
Oop.

369
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,994
I got this.

370
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:33,396
Thanks.

371
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,498
This okay?
Am I hurting y...

372
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,699
I got this.
Whoa!

373
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,167
(grunts)

374
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,635
(door rattling)

375
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:43,372
Someone's trying to break in--
call the cops.

376
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,374
I got this.

377
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,411
Did that really bother you?

378
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:51,013
Well, yeah.
It's nice to be needed.

379
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:52,982
Look, I'm sorry.

380
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:56,652
(phone chimes)
I didn't mean to upset you.

381
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:57,787
It's Becky.

382
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,456
Aw, she's trapped
in a revolving door.

383
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,259
I got this.

384
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,561
Yeah.

385
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,166
(goofy voice):
Let's make a baby!

386
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,435
Mm, mm, mm, mm!
Whoa!

387
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,604
Baby, you're packing snowballs,

388
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:17,006
and your breath smells
like a mermaid fart.

389
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,942
Loving the dirty talk-- but
you know what's even hotter?

390
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:21,577
If we face this-a-way.

391
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,179
Ooh, we're bad.

392
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,914
Wait... hey, baby,

393
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:26,782
why are you facing me north?

394
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,750
(gasps)

395
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:30,586
You're trying
to make us have a boy.

396
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:33,022
I... can ex...

397
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:35,825
How do you know
about the north thing?

398
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:37,326
Um, um...

399
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,962
And what are you doing
with those lemons?

400
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,432
Baby girl fertilizer!

401
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,169
You're trying to make
us have a girl!

402
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:52,382
<i>You are trying to
make us have a girl.</i>

403
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:54,851
All my least favorite students
have been boys.

404
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:57,721
So I Googled
"how to make a girl"--

405
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:00,357
some really weird
stuff came up--

406
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:03,393
but finally, I found
this conception Web site

407
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:04,628
that said you should...

408
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,664
<i>point south at the moment
of conception...</i>

409
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,232
<i>eat a lemon...</i>

410
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,634
(sighs)

411
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:12,803
(groans)

412
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:17,207
<i>...and heat up your lady parts
to a balmy 105 degrees.</i>

413
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,409
(blow-dryer whooshing)

414
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,180
Ooh... ah...

415
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,449
Oh, that's not bad.

416
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,985
MARSHALL:
Eriksen!

417
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,690
Lily, how could you do...

418
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,392
exactly the same thing I did?

419
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:37,527
You're supposed to be
the sane one.

420
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,863
See that?
Another boy expecting a woman

421
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,331
to clean up his mistakes.

422
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,700
That's why girls
are way better than boys.

423
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:45,235
Oh, really. Well,
then how come whenever there's

424
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,604
a creepy kid in a horror movie
it's always a little girl?

425
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:49,206
Or twin girls, who speak...

426
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,475
(eerily):
in unison.

427
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,343
Oh, well, what about Chucky?

428
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:55,512
Okay, A) He was a doll;

429
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,815
<i>B) He was possessed
by an adult serial killer;</i>

430
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:02,853
and C) How could you bring up
Chucky right before bed?

431
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:06,089
(doorbell rings)

432
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,291
Hey.
Hey.

433
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,994
Hey. Um, when we were dating,

434
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:13,330
did... did I
make you feel needed?

435
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:16,366
No, I didn't feel like
you needed me at all.

436
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:18,668
(sighs)
That's what I thought.

437
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,872
Uh, I'm sorry.
Wait, where are you...

438
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,974
That's a compliment.

439
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:27,344
You are the least needy woman
I've ever met-- that's awesome.

440
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:29,446
I mean, no guy's gonna say

441
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,147
"Who's your daddy?"
to Robin Scherbatsky.

442
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:32,582
You're your own daddy.

443
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,117
And mommy.

444
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,887
And weird survivalist uncle
who lives in a cabin

445
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:39,422
with a shotgun
blaming stuff on the government.

446
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,728
And that
is what makes you the most...

447
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:48,031
amazing, strong...

448
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:51,301
independent woman
I've ever banged.

449
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,869
Thanks, Barney.

450
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,171
You know, um...

451
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:57,607
there's something
that I wanted to ask you,

452
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:02,312
and I don't really know how
to say it so... here goes.

453
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:06,149
Who's the crazy chick
in the apron?

454
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,653
(baby voice): Someone naughty
left his toys on the floor

455
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:13,557
and needs to be spanked
on his tushy-tush.

456
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,728
(baby voice):
Uh-oh, I'm in "twubble."

457
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:20,764
You did it? How?

458
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,332
Last night,
after admitting defeat,

459
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,734
I just let myself go.

460
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,503
Mmm, that looks so good.

461
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:27,871
Can I have some?

462
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,105
No!

463
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,841
<i>It's my ice cream;
you can't have any.</i>

464
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:35,412
(baby voice): Someone needs
to teach you how to share.

465
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:41,051
Who's your mommy?

466
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,890
Challenge completed!

467
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,192
(chuckles)
Now, uh, can you get

468
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,061
this freak out of here?
I'm really scared.

469
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,096
I got this.

470
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:00,670
Oh, so you finally
agreed on a name?

471
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:03,073
CLAUDIA (sighs):
Uh, well,

472
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:06,610
the other night she ran
a really high fever.

473
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,445
<i>STUART: We rushed her
to the emergency room</i>

474
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,547
<i>at 3:00 in the morning,
but they wouldn't</i>

475
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:14,217
<i>admit her without a name.</i>

476
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:18,755
<i>Right then and there, we
realized how stupid we were being.</i>

477
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:20,790
We looked
at each other

478
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,826
and, well, we just knew.

479
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,828
Our baby's name is...

480
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,463
Esther.
Esther.

481
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,398
(chokes)
Esther?

482
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:31,001
ANNOUNCER:
Esther!

483
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,702
That's beautiful.

484
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,170
Yeah.

485
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,941
We're idiots.

486
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:41,177
Baby, names and gender,
it's just, like...

487
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:43,780
it's some way of giving
ourselves the illusion

488
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:45,882
that we have any
control whatsoever.

489
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,952
I- I just want a healthy,
happy, 12-pound--

490
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,720
Whoa.

491
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,322
Ten-pound?

492
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:54,491
Eight-pound?

493
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,126
(sighs)
I guess, but, dude,

494
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,828
you're writing checks
my vagina can't cash.

495
00:19:58,829 --> 00:19:59,863
(laughs)

496
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,598
I love you.

497
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,235
And I'm gonna love the crap
out of whatever baby we have.

498
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,403
Me, too.

499
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,510
You know what?

500
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:17,013
We should just think of a name that's
good for either a girl or a boy.

501
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,014
Like, um...

502
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:20,350
Jamie.
Jamie.

503
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,052
Marshall...

504
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,354
we just named our baby.

505
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:26,423
Jamie.

506
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,857
Mmm...
Mmm...

507
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:31,728
Not Jamie.

508
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,766
(merry-go-round calliope
playing) Shoe's untied. I got it.

509
00:20:52,974 --> 00:20:55,576
Yeah, this is over.
