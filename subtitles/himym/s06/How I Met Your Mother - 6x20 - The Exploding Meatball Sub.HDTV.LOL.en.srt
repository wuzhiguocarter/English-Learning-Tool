<i>Kids, as you know,</i>

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:03,371
<i>I was designing</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank's</i>

3
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:06,174
<i>new headquarters on the site of</i>
<i>this old hotel, The Arcadian.</i>

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,993
<i>Problem was,</i>
<i>some people didn't want</i>

5
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:10,578
<i>The Arcadian torn down.</i>

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,465
<i>Even bigger problem, they were</i>
<i>led by my girlfriend Zoey.</i>

7
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:15,633
G-N-B is
the e-ne-my!

8
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:17,618
Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on!
Hey, sweetie!

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,421
Are we still on for dinner
at 8:00 at Valenzisi's?

10
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:24,425
That's great! I can't wait!

11
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:26,794
That's great. I can't wait!
That's great. I can't wait!

12
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:30,231
<i>But somehow, Zoey and I were</i>
<i>making it work.</i>

13
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:33,367
Ted, why are you dating
our arch-enemy?!

14
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,236
I mean, Wile E.
Coyote wasn't trying

15
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:36,404
to sleep with the Roadrunner.

16
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,005
Or maybe he was.

17
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,273
Think about it.

18
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:41,409
The way that she bats
her eyelashes

19
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,879
and shakes her
tail feathers in his face?

20
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,214
She wants it.

21
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,484
Isn't it hard for you guys
to be on opposite sides

22
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,485
of something like this?

23
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,286
Of course you feel that way,
Lily.

24
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:54,021
You and Marshall
have basically melded

25
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:56,357
into one big
hermaphroditic blob.

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,092
And that's fine for you guys.

27
00:00:58,094 --> 00:00:59,260
But some of us want

28
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:01,796
a partner who challenges us
to grow and evolve.

29
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:04,565
You guys are in screaming
matches all the time.

30
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:05,800
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

31
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:07,368
<i>Growing</i> matches.

32
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,769
<i>It was true.</i>

33
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:11,072
<i>Zoey and I loved</i>
<i>to challenge each other.</i>

34
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,608
The main character
is a young spoiled prince

35
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,110
thrust into leadership
after the death of his father.

36
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:18,279
It's obviously a modern-day
retelling of <i>Henry IV!</i>

37
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:20,181
Are you kidding me?!

38
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:22,483
It's <i>Don Quixote...</i>
the classic quest story

39
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:25,353
with the hero-jester and his
long-suffering manservant!

40
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:28,089
Okay, clearly,
when we're watching <i>Tommy Boy,</i>

41
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:31,358
we're watching
two different movies.

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,960
No, you hang up.

43
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,695
No, you hang up.

44
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,864
No, you hang up.

45
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,332
No, you hang up.

46
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,835
No, you hang up!

47
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:43,170
No, you hang up.

48
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:44,372
No, you hang up.

49
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:45,806
No, you...

50
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:48,042
Hold on.

51
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:49,744
Hello?

52
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:53,314
For the love of God, will one
of you idiots hang up the phone?

53
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,686
Why would you do that?!

54
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:00,888
I-I thought you'd like it.

55
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,623
Who likes that?

56
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,692
I like it.

57
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:09,196
Your relationship
sounds exhausting.

58
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:11,365
Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.

59
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:14,702
Marshall and I have been
together 15 years,

60
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:17,238
and the only debate
we've had about <i>Tommy Boy</i>

61
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,041
is whether it's awesome
or super awesome.

62
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:22,243
That's love, bitch.

Quit GNB?! Why?

73
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,848
I need to do better
things with my life, okay?

74
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,850
There's-There's an opening
for an environmental lawyer

75
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,752
at the National Resources
Defense Council.

76
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:06,287
Sure, it pays less, but

77
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:09,790
I'd be saving the oceans,
saving endangered species...

78
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:13,494
Saving chicken bones and
an old boot to make hobo soup?

79
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,862
Marshall, you can't

80
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:18,399

Graduation goggles,
like with high school.

100
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:12,972
It's four years of bullies

101
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:14,941
making fun of all the kids
with braces,

00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:17,877

150
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,816
It's a little less money
than I was expecting.

151
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:22,235
I mean, compared to what I was

It's always the one

163
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:55,268
And no, I don't want to play.

164
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,104

What? Why?

168
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,445

Landmark Preservation Committee

169

170
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,481

the Arcadian a landmark,

00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:15,421
of a husky-voiced hottie
in a turtleneck.

174
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,920
...so, if the Landmarks
Preservation Committee

175
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,823
sides with Zoey, your whole
project goes down the tubes?

176
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,448
You must be furious.

177
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,452
I'm furiously enjoying
being challenged.

178
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:33,920
Why don't you admit that

179
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,822
your girlfriend challenging
your every move

180
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:38,425
is getting you
a little murder-suicidey?

181
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:40,493
Why don't you admit that
Marshall quitting his job

182
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:42,495
and taking an unpaid
internship is killing you?

183
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:43,363
It's not.

184
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:44,764
Lily, the downside

185
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,633
to having giant,
Japanese anime eyes is

186
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,967
that they're easy to read.

187
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,269
And yours are screaming,

188
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:51,704
"What about my trip
to Spain, deadbeat?"

189
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,774
Okay, Ted, the downside
to having a woman's mouth is,

190
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:57,510
your feminine pout gives away
your true feelings.

191
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:59,112
And yours is saying,

192
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:02,849
"Oh, Zoey, why can't I be
on top just this once?"

193
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,417
We take turns!

194
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,102
Sometimes.

195
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,138
Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey.

196
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,657
I just had the best first day
at the NRDC.

197
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,596
I'm sorry. Sorry.

198
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:19,282
Something Hershel said
at work today.

199
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:22,168
Hershel?

200
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,437
What, don't you guys know
Hershel? Didn't I tell you?

201
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,673
Oh, he's the new lawyer
who replaced Marshall at GNB.

202
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:27,774
He is so

203
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,843
awesome and funny

204
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:31,578
and tall... taller
than Marshall...

205
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,512
and he knows

206
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,114
way more laws.

207
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,949
Well, I'm glad
you like your new co-worker.

208
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:37,350
There's no Hershel!

209
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,018
I was just saying that
to make you jealous!

210
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,437
Why do you insist
we play these games?

211
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:43,189
Barney, I'm not playing...
Just come back to GNB already!

212
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,424
I'm really loving my new job.

213
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:47,360
Oh, and I'm loving
seeing you this happy.

214
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,095
I'm so glad to hear you say that

215
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:50,280
because I volunteered
our apartment

216
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:51,965
for a big NRDC fund-raiser
tomorrow night.

217
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,133
You're-You're cool
with that, right?

218
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,567
Baby, you have my full support.

219
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:56,236
Thanks, baby.

220
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:57,837
Oh.

221
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,305
Ooh, I gotta go.

222
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:00,273
The invitations are ready.

223
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,241
The party's for a bunch

224
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,408
of environmentalists,

225
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,943
so I found a guy downtown

226
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,245
who makes biodegradable
party invitations

227
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:08,214
that can also be used
as toilet paper.

228
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,183
That's how I'm gonna use mine.

229
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:12,469
Why in the world
do you care so much

230
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:14,254
whether Marshall works at GNB?

231
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,755
Care? I don't care.

232
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:17,524
I'm like, whatever.
Marshall who?

233
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:20,160
He's stupid.
Hershel's way better.

234
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,095
Okay, Barney, is
it possible that

235
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:24,297
with everything that's gone
on with your dad lately,

236
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,299
you might have some
unresolved abandonment issues

237
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,934
you're transferring
onto Marshall?

238
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,102
Oh! Ugh!

239
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,636
You are worse than my shrink.

240
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:33,506
"Barney, we have
to talk about your father."

241
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:36,142
"Barney, I'm not going to teach
you how to hypnotize people.

242
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,610
You'll only use it for evil."

243
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,762
"Barney, I am not going
to conduct a couples session

244
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:41,080
"between you and this woman.

245
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,248
She's obviously a prostitute."

246
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,217
I don't need this!

247
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,703
Ah, Lily Aldrin,

248
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,655
half of the world's
most perfect couple!

249
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,557
I was thinking about
that woman's mouth comment,

250
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,025
and I have
three good comebacks.

251
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:54,827
Your mom didn't seem
to mind it last night on her...

252
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,429
Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor.

253
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,681
Would you mind driving out
to Kennedy with me

254
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:01,167
to pick up this famous ecologist
for Marshall's fund-raiser?

255
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,169
Apparently,
he only speaks Spanish.

256
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,637
And you speak Spanish, right?

257
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:11,277
Perfect. Let's go.

258
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:14,747
Hey, Marshall, it's me.

259
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,866
Listen, I know
I've been kind of a jerk

260
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,017
about your leaving GNB.

261
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,153
I just wanted
to call and say I'm sorry.

262
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:22,388
No apologies necessary.
We're good.

263
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,124
Good. Um, hey, any chance
you might maybe...

264
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,993
I don't know...
if you're not busy,

265
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,028
uh, want to have lunch today?

266
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,864
Oh, buddy,
I'd love to, but I can't.

267
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:32,999
Oh, that's cool.

268
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,434
No biggie.

269
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:36,636
Another time.

270
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,290
Oh, my God!

271
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:00,026
How long have you been there?

272
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,694
You don't remember?

273
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,964
Hey. I was in the
neighborhood.

274
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,633
I just wanted
to check in on you.

275
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:09,168
You seemed, um, you seemed
really upset the other day.

276
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,703
Oh, no, I'm fine.

277
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,790
Okay. Well, um, you want
to go grab some lunch?

278
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:17,910
Sure. Hey, are you okay if
I invite Marshall to join us?

279
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,145
Yeah.

280
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,299
Right.

281
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:25,451
So, um...

282
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:27,253
Chinese?

283
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,324
You know, just
because Zoey and I

284
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:33,993
are a different kind of couple
than you and Marshall

285
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,761
doesn't make us a worse couple.

286
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:38,815
You're right.

287
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:42,785
I-If you and Zoey are happy,
then who am I to judge?

288
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:45,705
I'm so sorry.

289
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:49,409
Oh, my God, is
that how support feels?

290
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:52,612
It's so warm and wonderful.

291
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,714
Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.

292
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:55,982
But I thought

293
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:57,450
you liked being challenged.

294
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:59,052
Nobody likes being challenged!

295
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:01,754
Couldn't she agree with me just
once, even on something little,

296
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:03,356
like... like what movie to see

297
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:05,591
or-or what topping
to get on our pizza

298
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,794
or... oh, I don't know,
my lifelong dream

299
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:10,897
of building a skyscraper
in New York City?!

300
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,899
Well, in her defense,
hamburger pizza, Ted?

301
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:14,934
What are you, 12?

302
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:16,903
You were right, Lily.

303
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:19,906
I mean, Zoey's great,
but... sometimes I do wish

304
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:23,660
we were a little more
like you and Marshall.

305
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,247
TED
There he is. Here we go.

306
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,458
I'm sorry.

307
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,159
I don't speak...

308
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,661
whatever it is you're speaking.

309
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,164
Um, he speaks perfect English.

310
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,349
Yeah, I-I know.

311
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:47,700
Then why

312
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,302
did you ask me to come?

313
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:51,904
So you can drive him
to the fund-raiser.

314
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:53,473
Supporting Marshall this much

315
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:54,840
is driving me crazy.

316
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,543
I'm going to Spain... my flight
leaves in 45 minutes.

317
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:58,611
<i>Adios,</i>

318
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,813
<i>muchacho.</i>

319
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:06,544
W-Wait, what do you mean
you're going to Spain?

320
00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:08,742
You were right.
If I hear myself say

321
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,161
"Baby, you have my full
support" one more time,

322
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,013
I swear I'm gonna
murder someone!

323
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:16,332
What are you gonna
tell Marshall, huh?

324
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:18,902
And when are you coming back?
I honestly

325
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:21,905
haven't thought it all the way
through, and I don't intend to.

326
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:24,858
All I know is that
I'm a ticking time bomb,

327
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,010
and if I don't do something
for me right away,

328
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,946
I swear I'm gonna explode!

329
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:32,649
Wow, tha... that's
an evocative metaphor to use

330
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:35,085
for your nonthreatening,
totally patriotic emotions.

331
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,420
U.S.A.!

332
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,188
Okay, Lily, I get it.

333
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,623
Marshall's been asking
a lot lately.

334
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,859
But the thing to do is-is
tell him you've had enough.

335
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:44,294
I've never been good at that.

336
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:46,463
And now, ever
since his dad died,

337
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:50,033
I-I feel like it's my job
to just be fine with everything.

338
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:51,201
But I'm not.

339
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:52,335
I'm not fine that

340
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:54,337
he volunteers our apartment
for a giant fund-raiser

341
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,056
and that he's
not thinking about

342
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,808
how we're gonna pay
any of our bills

343
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,042
and that, apparently,

344
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:02,879
we've given up on
trying to have kids.

345
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,881
Lil...

346
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:07,901
Look, I'm sorry, Ted,
I just, I gotta do this.

347
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:11,188
My bag?

348
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,457
Oh, no. I got it.

349
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,960
There's nothing to talk about.

350
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:18,495
You trashed your office today.

351
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:20,030
I mean, you obviously have

352
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:21,932
some deep feelings
you're not confronting.

353
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,934
And I think
they're about your dad.

354
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:26,303
I don't want to talk about it, okay?
Why not?

355
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:28,872
Because I don't. And why
am I explaining this to you?

356
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,624
You're the most secretive
person I know.

357
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,542
You never tell anybody anything.

358
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:37,380
I've never...
told anyone this before.

359
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:40,050
Um...

360
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:42,085
I was 16.

361
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:45,055
I was awakened around midnight

362
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:46,990
by the sound of my father

363
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:51,294
arguing with his business
partner, Andy Grenier.

364
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,263
As things grew heated...

365
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:57,267
I watched my father's hand
slowly coil

366
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,871
around the heavy
antique clock on his desk.

367
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,143
The sun was just
starting to rise

368
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:09,412
over the bramble orchard as
we packed the fresh earth down

369
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,414
with the flats of our shovels.

370
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,816
My dad and I

371
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:14,851
got our stories straight.

372
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:18,522
We walked back to the house
in silence and...

373
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:21,725
haven't talked about it since.

374
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,961
But sometimes...

375
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:27,597
on a still night...

376
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,000
you can still hear that clock,

377
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:31,668
ticking...

378
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,303
ticking...

379
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:34,838
ticking.

380
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:38,475
That's...

381
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:42,245
the most harrowing story
I've ever heard.

382
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:43,747
Is it true?

383
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,882
No.

384
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:48,718
But it did get you
to drink three scotches,

385
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,354
which is why you're
ready to spill your guts.

386
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:52,822
Fine!

387
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:56,626
The reason I'm upset
about Marshall leaving GNB

388
00:15:56,628 --> 00:16:00,664
is... is...

389
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,299
Hey.

390
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,870
...the meatball sub.

391
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:07,837
Huh?

392
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,606
It all started months ago

393
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,441
in the GNB commissary.

394
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,376
It was Meatball Sub Day.

395
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:15,779
<i>Oh, how I used to love</i>

396
00:16:15,781 --> 00:16:17,030
<i>Meatball Sub Day.</i>

397
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:21,084
<i>And then, the most</i>
<i>humiliating moment of my life.</i>

398
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:23,486
Hey, buddy, I think
you got a tiny little bit

399
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:25,455
of marinara sauce
on your tie there.

400
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,797
<i>I plotted my revenge for weeks.</i>

401
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,582
<i>But nothing seemed right.</i>

402
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,567
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

403
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,837
<i>The answer was</i>
<i>so elegant and simple...</i>

404
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:47,227
<i>an exploding meatball sub.</i>

405
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:51,881
<i>For months, I experimented.</i>

406
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:07,197
More... marinara sauce.

407
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:11,101
<i>Finally, the sub was perfected.</i>

408
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,902
<i>The plan was in place.</i>

409
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:15,472
<i>The snare was baited.</i>

410
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:17,240
<i>And then...</i>

411
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:19,909
he quit, Robin, he quit!

412
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:20,877
It's Meatball Sub Day

413
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:22,078
today, which is why

414
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,130
I wanted Marshall
to come over and have lunch.

415
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:25,215
But no.

416
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:27,083
All that work wasted.

417
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:33,857
You want to make God laugh,
tell him your plans, right?

418
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,761
What is wrong with you?

419
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:41,031
Hey, Professor Rodriguez,

420
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:42,332
thank you so much for coming.

421
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:43,433
Oh, my pleasure.

422
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,068
I have to use the restroom.

423
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,836
Do you have some
extra invitations?

424
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,338
Right over there.

425
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,506
Enjoy.

426
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:51,291
Hey. Hey, thanks for
picking him up.

427
00:17:51,293 --> 00:17:53,326
Yeah, absolutely.
Um, listen,

428
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:56,046
something happened
at the airport. Um...

429
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,447
What?
Well,

430
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:59,132
we got there, and, uh, Lily...

431
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:00,783
Lily...

432
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:01,785
Marshall, hey.

433
00:18:01,787 --> 00:18:03,720
Sorry, I, uh, I had to park

434
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:05,639
and-and grab some ice.

435
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:06,723
Sorry.

436
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:08,124
Oh, thanks, babe.

437
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,727
You would not believe
how much this one has done

438
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,128
to help throw this party, Ted.

439
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,730
I don't know how she does it.

440
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:16,399
Can't be easy, huh, Lil?

441
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:19,736
Yeah. Listen, Marshall,

442
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:21,938
I-I need to talk to you
about something.

443
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,506
No, you know what?
Me, too.

444
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,075
Um... I want to thank you

445
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:27,410
for being so supportive
of me in all this.

446
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:29,479
I've been at the NRDC
for less than a week,

447
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,348
and I've already done
more to be proud of

448
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,516
than in two years at GNB.

449
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:35,885
I can't believe
how good it feels.

450
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:39,673
But now, it's time for me
to find a way

451
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:41,891
to help the Earth
and get paid for it,

452
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:44,728
because I can't put that
burden entirely on you.

453
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,162
So, starting tomorrow,

454
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:48,498
I'll look for something
with a paycheck.

455
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,566
What do you think?

456
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:52,719
Baby, you have my full support.
Oh...

457
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,372
Ted.

458
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:57,407
Hey!

459
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,876
What are you doing here?
This is really important

460
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,345
to Marshall, so I came
to show my support.

461
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:04,381
This you can be supportive of?!

462
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:06,282
What is that supposed to mean?
I have

463
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:07,650
the chance to build
a skyscraper

464
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,986
in the best city on Earth,
and who's the one

465
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:11,654
leading the charge
to kill that dream?

466
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:12,872
My girlfriend!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

467
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:15,191
What about my lifelong
dream of not seeing

468
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,127
every beautiful building
in Manhattan bulldozed?

469
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:20,296
<i>And in that moment, I
realized, though I really cared</i>

470
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:23,166
<i>about Zoey, I couldn't do this</i>
<i>for the next 50 years.</i>

471
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:25,068
<i>I had to break up with her.</i>

472
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,336
<i>But then...</i>

473
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:31,591
♪ I will remember you ♪

474
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,228
♪ Will you remember me... ♪

475
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,147
<i>Kids, some couples</i>
<i>always support each other,</i>

476
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,416
<i>and some couples</i>
<i>always challenge each other,</i>

477
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:42,051
<i>but is one really</i>
<i>better than the other?</i>

478
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:44,020
<i>Yes. Support is better.</i>

479
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:45,955
<i>Way better.</i>

480
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:48,942
<i>But I'd have</i>
<i>to learn that the hard way.</i>

481
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,428
You're too young.
This isn't fair.

482
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:54,771
We're not going
anywhere, buddy.

483
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:56,606
We're gonna stay here
right till the end.

484
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:57,807
Thank you, Marshall.

485
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,211
Marshall...

486
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,345
can I ask

487
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:04,514
one final favor, my friend?

488
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:07,450
Yes, of course,
of course... anything.

489
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:11,688
Eat this meatball sub.

490
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,024
Wh-Where'd you get
a meatball...

491
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:16,793
I don't have much time!
Okay, yes, yes, of course.

492
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,645
Of course.

493
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,566
Does this have some sort
of special meaning?

494
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:33,009
I'm not sick, you idiots!

495
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:35,812
I've racked up $30,000
of uninsured medical bills

496
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,614
for symptoms I don't even have.

497
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:38,748
Totally worth it!

498
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,000
You should see
the look on your face.

499
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:44,454
Oh, wait, you can't... 'cause
it's covered in marinara sauce!

500
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,659
Uh, Barney, you got
a little marinara

501
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,327
on your pajamas.
