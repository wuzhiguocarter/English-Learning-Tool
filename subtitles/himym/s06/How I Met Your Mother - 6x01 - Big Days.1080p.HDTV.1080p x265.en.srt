1
00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:03,770
<i>Kids, there are two big days
in any love story:</i>

2
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:06,213
<i>the day you meet
the girl of your dreams,</i>

3
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:07,965
<i>and the day you marry her.</i>

4
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:43,656
Nice. Where'd you get this?

5
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,132
Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit.

6
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:48,726
- Beer be with you.
- And also with you.

7
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:53,812
Man, this is what church
has been missing.

8
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:56,634
- Dude, you fixed church.
- You're welcome, God.

9
00:00:58,623 --> 00:00:59,623
Nervous?

10
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,071
No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain.

11
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:03,844
Why? Do I look nervous?

12
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:05,773
Look at your beer.

13
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:07,775
You do that when you're nervous.

14
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,367
It's a sad day in New York, Ted.

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,991
A sad day, indeed.

16
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:18,510
Do you know what I saw
on my way in here?

17
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:19,767
A girl...

18
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,918
in a sweater.

19
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,070
And you know what that means.

20
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:27,575
The season of exposed skin is over.

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,721
Exactly.

22
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,881
Gone are the tank tops.

23
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,675
Gone are the cute little skirts.

24
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:34,385
Gone are the sun dresses.

25
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:35,678
The sun dresses!

26
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:37,346
I don't think

27
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,682
I can make it another eight months
with no sun dresses.

28
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,018
- I have to grade these papers.
- I'm sorry. I'll let you work.

29
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,729
But first, a riddle:

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,642
What piece of women's attire
most stokes a man's desire?

31
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,193
A sun dress.

32
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:52,570
Correct.

33
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,266
What lightweight outfit,
pink or white,

34
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:59,285
makes the front of my slacks
abnormally tight?

35
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,371
- I really have to get this done.
- Of course.

36
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,040
"Sun dress," by the way.

37
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,380
What are you nervous about?
Tell me...

38
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,884
- What flowing cotton frock...
- I'll tell you. Just...

39
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,014
There's a girl sitting at the bar.

40
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,101
- Don't look!
- I want to see a pretty girl.

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,271
Okay, you can look.
Just be cool for once.

42
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:29,710
I'll be cool.

43
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,700
You got your beer label
in a bunch over nothing.

44
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,686
Listen to your Uncle Barney.

45
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,605
You have no reason to be nervous.

46
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:46,164
None whatsoever.

47
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:49,461
And I'm going to tell you why
in one word.

48
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,670
- And what's that word?
- Dibs!

49
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,631

54
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,577
You can't call dibs
on a girl I've been sitting here

55
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:10,105
thinking about maybe talking
to eventually at some point.

56
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:11,982
You never called dibs.

57
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,442
Dibs were implied.

58
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,069
Implied dibs?

59
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,398
You are spitting
on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs,

60
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:22,411
inventor of the dib.
It was 1652...

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,453
The SS Dibs was lost...

62
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,587
I don't have time
for a fake history lesson,

63
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:28,079
so I'll keep this simple.

64
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:31,126
You go over there and talk to that girl,
I will see you in court.

65
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,504
And who's gonna represent you?
Dibs on Marshall!

66
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,840
- Damn it.
- Where is Marshall anyway?

67
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,151
<i>Uncle Marshall
and Aunt Lily had recently decided</i>

68
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:40,135
<i>to take a swing
at starting a family.</i>

69
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,232
<i>Tonight was their first at-bat.</i>

70
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:43,973
I'm almost ready to leave.

71
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,724
Let's see the checklist. Candles?

72
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,935
- Check.
- Music to set the mood?

73
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Check.

74
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,028
Music for when
we're actually doing it?

75
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,737
You know what?

76
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:01,824
To hell with your dibs.
I'm going over there and talking to her.

77
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:05,327
Be my guest.
Fall in love with her. Get married.

78
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,579
Just know this:

79
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,707
When I step up to make my toast
as your best man...

80
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,626
- Marshall would probably be...
- As your best man...

81
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,613
Ladies and Gentlemen...

82
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:16,088
I...

83
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,802
had dibs.

84
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,011
Tell me this isn't true.

85
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,977
I had implied dibs.

86
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,204
You've humiliated me!

87
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,020
I had no idea.
You have to know that.

88
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:34,523
You're the victim here.
We both are.

89
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,817
Let's get out.

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,361
Or, we could just do it right here.

91
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,499
Fine.
Have at it.

92
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,499
Exercise your dibs.

93
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:50,122
She's got her shields up.
She's reading a book.

94
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,777
At a bar.
That book might as well be called:

95
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,920
Are You There, Barney?
It's Me, Horny.

96
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:58,644
That is not
what "shields up" looks like.

97
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,383
That is what "shields up"
looks like.

98
00:05:02,484 --> 00:05:03,484
Move.

99
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:09,836
'Sup, dudes?

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Fries?

101
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,563
Good God, woman.
You're a disgrace.

102
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,232
No fries for this guy.

103
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,717
Seriously, I love you, but it's like

104
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:23,026
you have squiggly cartoon odor lines
coming off of you right now.

105
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,828
Just cut her some slack, okay?
She just went through a breakup.

106
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,655
With hygiene?

107
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,691
<i>No, with Don.</i>

108
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:33,290
<i>A few months earlier...</i>

109
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,202
- Here, have some tea.
- Thanks.

110
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:39,004
Robin, I am here for you.
Whatever you need.

111
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,381
Okay, about that.

112
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:42,842
Ted, listen.

113
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:45,677
I know myself pretty well.

114
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:50,432
Some time over the next few months,
I'm going to want to sleep with you.

115
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:53,477
And when that happens,
you have to try to say no.

116
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:54,785
Try?

117
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,648
I will absolutely say no.
Our friendship is too important.

118
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,458
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

119
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:05,739
I will come at you
with everything I've got.

120
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:09,548
I will stalk you
like the lioness stalks the gazelle,

121
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,023
careful, patient,

122
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,788
deadly.

123
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:16,356
And if you let your guard down
for so much as a second,

124
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:17,972
as sure as you were born,

125
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:20,913
I will hump your brains out.

126
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,817
I'm ready to have sex now.

127
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:35,178
It was a tough summer, but I think
our girl's been a real trooper.

128
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:36,303
She's...

129
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,705
Is this a Cheeto?

130
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,608
No, we ran out of Cheetos last week.

131
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,459
Yeah, it's a Cheeto.
Dibs.

132
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:46,748
You're exquisite.

133
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,379
You must let me paint you.

134
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,411
What do you think?
The girl sitting at the bar, shields up?

135
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:55,164
Totes, toots.
She's here on a date.

136
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,608
She brought the book
because she got here early,

137
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,236
and she also wants to impress
the guy she's meeting.

138
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,484
Girls like to come across all
classy and smart, you know?

139
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,099
This?
What you're doing right now?

140
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,470
I'm getting a "de-rection."

141
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:13,440
How'd it go?
You pregnant yet?

142
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,565
Nope!

143
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,143
So, here's what happened.

144
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,103
I was at home, waiting for Marshall.

145
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,230
How was your day?

146
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,951
Don't answer. No time.

147
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,358
Bedroom. No time.

148
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,737
Floor. No time.

149
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,987
- Against this wall!
- Marshall. Wait.

150
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,198
A big package just arrived.

151
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:31,325
- Yeah, it did.
- No.

152
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,452
It's a real package from your dad.

153
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,794
That's a little weird,
but yeah, it is.

154
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:37,565
Look!

155
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:41,871
A bassinet?
Oh, my...

156
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,546
He must've made it in his wood shop.

157
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,464
Wasn't that sweet of him?

158
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,333
Isn't that sweet?

159
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,391
You told your dad we're trying
to have a baby?

160
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,496
Of course I did.
I tell my dad everything.

161
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,062
My dad is my best friend.

162
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,021
We have been looking forward

163
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:08,250
to this magical, special night
for two weeks now.

164
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,137
And, sweetie, during that time,
I have been...

165
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,118
How do I put this delicately?

166
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,541
Saving all my love for you.

167
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,377
I have read 11 books on conception.

168
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,711
I have cut out

169
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,706
alcohol, caffeine and sugar.

170
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:28,847
I take my temperature every hour.

171
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,636
But good for you
for not playing with yourself.

172
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,634
- I feel you, buddy.
- Don't even touch me, dude.

173
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,433
It's been two weeks.

174
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,784
I'm, like, a light breeze away
from having a big problem.

175
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,909
Seriously.

176
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,724
Okay, I'm better now.

177
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,263
- What's this going to cost me?
- Excuse me?

178
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:53,782
I want to buy your dibs.

179
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:56,261
Two... hundred...

180
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:57,973
and fifty thousand dollars.

181
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,288
20 bucks.

182
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:01,685
But I...

183
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,212
- Can I go smell her first?
- No.

184
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,170
All right.

185
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:08,297
Wish me luck.

186
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,677
<i>Now kids, remember how I told you
about a girl named Cindy?</i>

187
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,054
<i>How I went on one date
and it ended...</i>

188
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,491
- Get out.
- <i>badly?</i>

189
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,808
- How are you?
- Good.

190
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,357
- What the hell are you doing?
- That girl she's talking to?

191
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:28,865
I dated her.

192
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:32,006
That sucks!

193
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,338
And dibs.

194
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:42,004
So you went on one date
with one of her friends.

195
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,056
It's not necessarily a big deal.

196
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:45,624
Did it end on bad terms?

197
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,086
Hi Cindy!

198
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:50,086
Hi Cindy!

199
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:57,790
Well, I guess
you just got to move on.

200
00:09:57,915 --> 00:10:01,056
It's not like you have a shot
with Ready McGee over there, right?

201
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:05,150
<i>Then I remembered.</i>

202
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,020
<i>Cindy had a roommate.</i>

203
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:10,143
<i>A roommate
I only caught a glimpse of...</i>

204
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:14,218
<i>But a roommate who,
by every indication,</i>

205
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:16,071
<i>was something very special.</i>

206
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,544
<i>Was it possible?</i>

207
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,929
<i>Could this be the girl
attached to that ankle?</i>

208
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:27,207
I got to see her ankles.

209
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,875
You're one of those?

210
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:31,544
God, I swear, one in five guys...

211
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,298
We kind of had a plan tonight,
remember?

212
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,780
Candles? Banjo?

213
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:39,427
Who else did you tell?
Did you tell anyone at the office?

214
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:48,305
Start the music.

215
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:55,664
Can you dig it?

216
00:10:57,947 --> 00:10:59,590
Take it to the hole, Eriksen!

217
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:01,825
Sink that putt, big fuzz!

218
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:05,266
Put a pillow under her lower back.
It helps facilitate conception, bro!

219
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:16,893
I may have mentioned it in passing
to a couple of colleagues at work.

220
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,999
I'm sorry about that,
but you know what?

221
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:20,927
I gottaa be able to tell my dad.

222
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,543
Your dad is the last person
you should tell!

223
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,068
The man is too involved
in our lives!

224
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,445
It's like,
every time the phone rings...

225
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,188
Lily, Marvin Eriksen.

226
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,316
I noticed you hadn't changed
your last name yet.

227
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:37,348
- No, I'm gonna...
- So, don't worry. I called the DMV,

228
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:40,322
I called your Amex, I got
that process started for you.

229
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,909
Lily, Marvin Eriksen.

230
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:47,280
I understand
you and Marshall have been fighting.

231
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:49,744
Well, let me tell you what works
for me and the missus.

232
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:52,368
Frilly French undies
and a box of wine.

233
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,255
You might wanna try pickles
on that sandwich.

234
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,551
Pickles would have helped
that sandwich!

235
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,793
The man has no boundaries.

236
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,973
And I just can't procreate
under these conditions!

237
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:10,685
Well, you know what? I've already
told him, so the damage is done.

238
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:13,646
So, call him and tell him
we decided not to have a baby.

239
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:17,484
Okay, so you just...
You want me to give my dad a stroke?

240
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:20,366
Only if you wanna give
this a stroke.

241
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:24,157
That's ridiculous. Lily,
there is no way that I would ever...

242
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,893
Okay, everyone needs
to shut up so that I can think!

243
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,178
- They're talking to a guy now.
- What kinda guy?

244
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,669
- A cheesy guy or a cool guy?
- A cheesy guy. Don't worry.

245
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,361
That guy is cool.

246
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:42,384
His hair's all cool,
he's got a cool belt.

247
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,490
That guy is cheesy,
and if you think he's not cheesy,

248
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:49,844
then you're cheesy, too,
and now I want something cheesy.

249
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,518
Who's feeling nachos?

250
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:53,937
Look at you, Robin.
You're jealous.

251
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:56,269
- Jealous?
- Yeah, jealous,

252
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:58,555
because she's got it,
and you've lost it.

253
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,319
I have not lost it.

254
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:02,404
You lost it.

255
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:03,872
I still have it.

256
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,125
I know exactly where it is,

257
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,518
and I can go get it

258
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:08,816
whenever I want.

259
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:12,032
Robin, girls are
like cartons of milk.

260
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,213
Each one has a hotness
expiration date,

261
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,888
and you've hit yours.

262
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,760
I'm not saying the occasional
guy won't still open the fridge,

263
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:21,221
pick you up, give a sniff,
shrug and take a sip anyway.

264
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:22,996
But it's all downhill from here.

265
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:25,135
I don't have to take this.

266
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,489
But I do have to take this.

267
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,139
So you just want me to call my dad

268
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:36,312
- and tell him we're not having a baby?
- That's about the size of it.

269
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,038
Out of curiosity,

270
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,900
when do we tell him about the baby?

271
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:43,945
We'll tell him about the baby
when there's a baby to tell him about.

272
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:45,963
So, he just gets no notice?

273
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:48,964
He just walks
into his boss's office, and says,

274
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,536
"I just had a grandson.
I'm gonna be out for three months."

275
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,204
Out for three months?

276
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:57,823
He and my mom are coming
to live with us when the baby's born.

277
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,920
- We talked about this.
- No, we didn't.

278
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,089
I meant, me and my dad.

279
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:06,468
You know what, Marshall? Why
don't you have a baby with your dad?

280
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,722
Why don't you have a baby
with your butt?

281
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,125
What?

282
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,017
I can't think straight!

283
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:16,432
Why do you have to wear that shirt?

284
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:19,922
This is not how I thought
this night was gonna go!

285
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:35,205
God, this sucks!
Do you think she saw me?

286
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,331
Hi, Ted!

287
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,416
Yeah, she definitely saw you.

288
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:40,919
Can I see you for a minute...
in private?

289
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:43,434
Yeah, sure. I mean,

290
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,049
how could that not be fun?

291
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,304
If I don't come back,
tell my mom I love her.

292
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:52,872
Will do. And dibs.

293
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:57,612
Barney, am I crazy?

294
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,063
Marshall talks to his dad
way too much, right?

295
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,357
You don't want my opinion on that.

296
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:03,358
Why not?

297
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,881
If I had my dad's number,

298
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,079
I would never not be
on the phone with him.

299
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,281
That was really...

300
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:12,310
A hottie with a body!

301
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,303
- Brief.
- No. Lily, look.

302
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,740
You saucy little minx.

303
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,129
You sundressed up.

304
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,468
14 seconds!

305
00:15:30,774 --> 00:15:32,554
14 seconds, and already

306
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,253
some dingdong is stepping up,

307
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:36,394
thinking he can get
some of this broke off.

308
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:40,099
I... still... got... it.

309
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,120
All right, buddy,
you proved my point. Now scram.

310
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,778
Nice belt, by the way.

311
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:54,441
Robin, you do look super hot.

312
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,388
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

313
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,162
Thanks.

314
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,543
<i>I braced myself for what was next:</i>

315
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:06,129
<i>rage, fury, a savage bitting.</i>

316
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:09,758
Thank you.

317
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:11,801
After things didn't
work out with us,

318
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:13,428
I got really sad for a while.

319
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,346
Then I realized,

320
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,795
you're not what I wanted,
and I'm not what you wanted.

321
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:19,732
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

322
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:21,949
I feel like I should
make it up to you somehow.

323
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,355
Buy you a beer
or Yankees tickets, or...

324
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,283
Or set me up with
one of your friends.

325
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:28,318
No, I'm kidding.
That would be weird.

326
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:30,194
No, it wouldn't. would it?

327
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:33,823
Any one of those three.
Whichever's easiest and right nearby.

328
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:35,908
And not the beer.

329
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:38,036
- I should get back.
- Totally.

330
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,205
Come say good-bye before you leave.

331
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:44,208
- Say good-bye before you leave?
- Her words exactly.

332
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:46,232
Dude, you are so in.

333
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:47,893
That is so awesome.

334
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:50,127
A high five doesn't cut.
High six!

335
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:53,843
She didn't see this.

336
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,322
- Good. That was lame.
- Let's never do that again.

337
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:01,370
What? Lily what?

338
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:04,270
Are there more members of my family
that you want to crap all over?

339
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,564
- Here's the thing.
- Sorry. Hold on.

340
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:08,004
Just...

341
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,525
It's my dad.

342
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,044
Lily, it's my dad, okay?

343
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,491
I love him, and if he calls me,
I'm gonna answer the phone!

344
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,664
I know it's late,
but I just had to call.

345
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:24,332
- How'd it go?
- This is...

346
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,251
Did you do everything the books say?
Put the pillow under her back?

347
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,190
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Did it feel like a boy?

348
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,547
Huh? You can tell.

349
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,091
He's insane.

350
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:35,635
My dad is insane.

351
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:39,263
I'm so sorry.

352
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,000
He's just...

353
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:44,838
He's so...

354
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:47,986
enthusiastic.

355
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:50,712
It's ridiculous, you know?

356
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,190
Who's like that?

357
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
You.

358
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,389
You're like that.

359
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:01,842
You and your dad both care so much.

360
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:06,958
It's why women fall in love
with the Eriksen men to begin with.

361
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,878
But right now,
it's a lot of pressure.

362
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,758
- I'm not trying to pressure you...
- What if I can't have a baby?

363
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,086
That could happen.

364
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:21,874
I could totally let you down.

365
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,601
Has that thought
not occurred to you?

366
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:28,754
Not even for one second.

367
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:36,093
Not having a baby would suck,

368
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:40,092
but the idea of you letting me down,

369
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,745
that's impossible.

370
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,248
That would be like aliens landing.

371
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,907
That's a bad example,
because that could happen.

372
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,604
It probably already has.
I saw this episode...

373
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:00,843
All right.

374
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:02,513
I'm doing this.

375
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,374
I am going over there.

376
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,094
Wish me luck.

377
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,365
<i>Nothing in this life
quite compares to the sweet,</i>

378
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,002
<i>terrifying exhilaration
of making your move.</i>

379
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,174
<i>When you just put it all
on the line and go for it.</i>

380
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:30,268
<i>And that night, by golly,</i>

381
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,485
<i>Cindy went for it.</i>

382
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,962
<i>So no, kids,
that girl wasn't your mother.</i>

383
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,273
<i>She ended up being
someone else's mother.</i>

384
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,514
<i>In fact, they both did.</i>

385
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,692
Like I said, she's here on a date.

386
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,415
<i>So that was not the day
I met your mother.</i>

387
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:15,086
<i>The day I met your mother
was the day of a wedding.</i>

388
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:17,638
Maybe I'm a little nervous.

389
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:20,881
- Dude, it's just a wedding toast.
- I know. I want it to be great.

390
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:23,486
- I want this whole day to be great.
- It will be.

391
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:26,597
Best man?
You're being summoned.

392
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,307
Geez, what now?

393
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,602
Ted, seriously, relax.
Everything's...

394
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,367
- Okay, and it's raining.
- Yeah. You were saying?

395
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,680
You didn't happen to bring
an umbrella, did you?

396
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:39,224
I didn't bring an umbrella.

397
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,428
Everyone told us that
it might take a while, but...

398
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:52,203
we thought we might be
the exception to the rule.

399
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,769
Anyways, we're getting back
on that horse. I mean,

400
00:20:56,884 --> 00:20:58,627
feeling good about the future.

401
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:04,592
Obviously, this goes without saying but,
you won't tell Lily about any of this?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
