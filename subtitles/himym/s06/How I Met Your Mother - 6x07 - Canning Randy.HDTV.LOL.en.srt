00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:06,072
TED:
And so, due to one
architectural oversight,

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:05,465
the Toledo Bridge Disaster
of 1906

3
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:08,900
claimed the lives of 75 people.

4
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:12,104
Now, I hate to stop
while I'm on a roll,

5
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:14,542
but happy Halloween, ya crazies!

6
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:16,010
(class cheering)

7
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:17,644
Hey, Professor Brosby,

8
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:19,480
you gonna come get beers
with us later?

9
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:20,749
Nah, I got a thing.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,950
But you kids have fun
trick or treating.

11
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,118
This is a treat.

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,521
You're the coolest,
Professor Mosby.

13
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:27,722
Well, hot dog.

14
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,690
(class laughs)
LILY: <i>Did it hurt?</i>

15
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:30,691
What?

16
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:32,125
Getting that kid's nose

17
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:34,427
surgically removed
from your ass.

18
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:38,364
It's not her nose that's in
my ass, Lily, it's her heart.

19
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,565
My class loves me;
I-I'm really making

20
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:42,500
an impression
on those guys.

21
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:45,971
I'd like to make impression
on those guys.

22
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:48,708
Man, I love the office
Halloween party.

23
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:51,912
It is so much sluttier
than the office Christmas party.

24
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:53,448
Though not as freaky

25
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,851
as the office President's
Day Rave.

26
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:58,955
Or the office Tu B'Shvat
Pajama Jammy-Jam.

27
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:01,390
Hey, guys.
Hey, Boss.

28
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:03,027
Hey, Randy.
Uh, you want a beer?

29
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:04,761
Oh, no, thank you.
I brew my own.

30
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:05,762
At the risk of bragging,

31
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:08,299
my Hazelnut Pilsner
won fourth prize

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,767
at the Weehawken Retirement Home

33
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,303
Clam Bake and Wheelchair
Maintenance Picnic.

34
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:15,239
I wouldn't consider any
part of that bragging.

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,774
Hey, it just occurred to me,
is your friend--

36
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:19,509
what's her name?--
Garbin, Flabin...

37
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,044
Robin?
Robin.
That's it, yeah.

38
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,346
Is she gonna be here?
Oh, not that I really care.

39
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:24,981
Robin has another
party to go to.

40
00:01:24,982 --> 00:01:26,482
No! Damn it!

41
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:28,185
I'm leaving.

42
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:29,353
But she might stop by later.

43
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:31,588
I guess I can
hang out a little longer.

44
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,331
So, anyone going to see
the Halloween parade?

45
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:43,400
NARRATOR:
<i>Oh, we were big fans of New</i>
<i>York's annual Halloween parade.</i>

46
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,068
<i>I don't mean the one</i>
<i>that takes place</i>

47
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,636
<i>Halloween night</i>
<i>in the Village.</i>

48
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:49,005
I mean the one that takes place
<i>the morning of November 1st--</i>

49
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:52,509
<i>the Annual Post Halloween</i>
<i>Walk of Shame Parade.</i>

50
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,277
Look at them
heading home

51
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:56,846
after their
dirty, filthy hookups.

52
00:01:56,847 --> 00:02:00,182
(shudders) Looks like
that bee got busy.

53
00:02:00,183 --> 00:02:01,684
(chuckles)

54
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:04,453
Looks like that French maid
didn't turn down somebody's bed.

55
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:07,924
Oh, looks like Pocahontas
has a couple of wounded knees.

56
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:09,759
Come on, Marshall.
That's a line.

57
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,761
No, it's because of the...
We get it.

58
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,630
Does it get any better
than this?

59
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,766
Uh, yes.

60
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,635
Yes, it does.

61
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:20,270
(sighs)

62
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:22,072
Crap.

Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger.

66
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,439
So, who's the lucky patient?

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,774
I don't want to
talk about it.

68
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,242
Please tell me
you're not hooking up

69
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:48,811
with one of your
co-anchors again.

70
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,379
My co-anchor's a woman.
Please tell me
you are hooking up

71
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,714
with one of your
co-anchors again.

72
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,583
(laughing)
NARRATOR: <i>Robin had</i>
<i>always believed</i>

73
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,151
<i>that the key to success</i>

74
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:56,886
<i>was intelligence,</i>
<i>hard work and professionalism.</i>

75
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:59,088
<i>Her new co-anchor Becky</i>

Boats! Boats! Boats!

00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,226
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It's the Farhampton Boat Show!</i>

78
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:07,730
Boats! Boats! Boats!

79
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:09,198
<i>Remember 5th, 6th and 7th</i>

80
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,866

00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,167
Boats! Boats! Boats!

82
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,635
<i>Come on down.</i>

83
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:16,004
B-B-B-Boats!

84
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,874
You did a commercial?

85
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,176
Why not?

86
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:21,210
You're a journalist!

87
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:23,045
Don't you want
to be taken seriously?

88
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:24,480
No. I'm cute.

89
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,082
Okay, well, if you
really think

90
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,950
this is going to
help your image.

91
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,920
Hi, Becky. Boats, boats, boats!

92
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:35,090
Robin, a little help here?

93
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,792
Aw...
Oh...
Robin,

94
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:38,994
you gotta not worry so much
about being liked.

95
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,430
Oh, easy for you to say.

96
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:42,031
Everybody loves you
at your job.

97
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:44,066
Mm.
<i>That was true</i>
<i>of my teaching job.</i>

98
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,603
<i>But I was also designing</i>
<i>the new headquarters</i>

99
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:48,438
<i>for Goliath National Bank,</i>
<i>and well...</i>

100
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,842
Ted Mosby, we don't like you!

101
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,577
What do you have to say
for yourself,

102
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,145
tearing down a beautiful,
old building

103
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:57,281
just to put up a stupid
band headquarters?

104
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:58,482
Hmm...

105
00:03:58,483 --> 00:03:59,883
Boo...

106
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:01,285
freakin'...

107
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:02,553
hoo.

108
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:04,888
Boo freakin' hoo? That's it?

109
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:06,724
The Arcadian

110
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,792
is an architecturally
significant...

111
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:10,628
Architecturally significant?!

112
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,797
Zoey, you're very pretty.

113
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,098
Your hair smells great.

114
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,100
Shampoo.
You should try it sometime.

115
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:18,769
You don't know the first thing
about architecture.

116
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,105
Key Ted Mosby's car.

117
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:22,573
Go on.

118
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:23,974
I'm a professor, okay?

119
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:26,744
I teach this stuff at one of the
best colleges in the country.

120
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,846
I don't go down
to your place of non-employment

121
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:31,015
and lecture you
about how your little protest

122
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,716
is a misguided waste of time,

123
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,618
except whoops, I just did.

124
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,919
Ha-burn.

125
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,489
Oh, good, the eggs are here.
Well, I should head up.

126
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,524
NARRATOR:
<i>No, GNB was not popular.</i>

127
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:42,626
<i>That's why every year they</i>
<i>produced a feel-good video</i>

128
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:44,028
<i>to improve the bank's image.</i>

129
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,129
GNB ANNOUNCER: <i>What makes</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank</i>

130
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,564
different from other big banks?

131
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:49,632
<i>Here at GNB, we care.</i>

132
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:53,236
I care about our precious Earth.

133
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,840
I care about old people.

134
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:01,276
I care about high-yield
offshore investments.

135
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:02,811
And so does Tugboat here.

136
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:04,979
Isn't that right, Tugboat?
Yeah.

137
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:08,082
Okay, get that camera
out of my face

138
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,317
before I flip you
like a cheese omelet.

139
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:11,786
All you have to do is say

140
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:15,323
"I care about
making dreams come true."

141
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:18,093
First of all, that line
makes me sound like a hooker

142
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:20,796
and saying it makes me
feel like a hooker, so.

143
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:22,298
Everyone is in this video.

144
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,434
Randy's in the video.

145
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:26,937
I don't want to brag,
but in 29 takes,

146
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:28,438
I only threw up thrice.

147
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,909
Wait. Randy, did you send the
Hermanson contracts downtown?

148
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,010
I did.

149
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:34,578
I sent them downtown.

150
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,980
Why are you saying it like that?

151
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,581
They never arrived
at the downtown office.

152
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:38,782
They...

153
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:41,085
Well, just to make sure
we're on the same page,

154
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:42,353
is "send them downtown"

155
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:44,721
not an expression
for shredding a document?

156
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,656
You shredded them?!

157
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:48,391
Yeah. I sent them downtown.

158
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:50,093
You know, down
into the shredder.

159
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:51,394
You-you feed the paper

160
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:52,495
in a downwards fashion,

161
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:54,163
so that's where the expression
comes from.

162
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,264
That's not an expression!

163
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:56,699
That has never
been an expression!

164
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,867
Okay, I can fix this.

165
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,502
I am all over this project.

166
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:03,840
I'll say this:

167
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,810
There is no quit in that guy.

168
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:07,011
You should fire him.

169
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,880
Okay, that, that right there.

170
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:11,182
That attitude is exactly why
I won't be in your video.

171
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,951
Because GNB doesn't care.

172
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,986
They hand out pink slips
like they're hors d'oevres.

173
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:17,255
Just last week,
I was talking to Arthur...

174
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:20,391
Oh, whoa, you're wearing
a green tie now.

175
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,359
I'm wearing a green tie.

176
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,627
(elevator bell dings)

177
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,996
GNB treats people like
they're disposable,

178
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:28,031
and I will not be
a part of that.

179
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:32,234
Marshall Eriksen
does not fire people, period.

180
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:34,135
Uh, just want you to know,

181
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:36,872
we are making good progress
on this new project.

182
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:37,840
(phone rings)

183
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:39,241
Oh, you gentlemen
keep talking,

184
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,976
I will answer that.

185
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:42,577
Marshall Eriksen's office.

186
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,079
Yeah, I can get that for you.

187
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,580
Just a second.

188
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:50,820
Uh... bank.
The "B" stands for bank.

189
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,921
Okay, Mother, I'll see you
tonight.

190
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:55,624
Oh, yikes. I'd better
get Mr. Messy a napkin.

191
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,099
(loud clattering)

192
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,768
Period.

193
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,670
Just tell me who
you slept with!

194
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,572
Lily, I don't want
to get into it, okay?

195
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,975
Aha, it's someone we know.

196
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:13,977
If it was some ding dong
we didn't know,

197
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:15,178
you'd just give me his name.

198
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,648
Fine. It's Bill Pepper.

199
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:19,883
Bill Pepper?

200
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:21,184
Mm-hmm.

201
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:23,353
Kind of a coincidence
there happens

202
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:25,655
to be a bill and a pepper
shaker here on the table.

203
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:29,793
(gasps)
Any chance you and Bill had a
three-way with Fork Napkin?

204
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:30,960
Oh...

205
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,330
It's someone we know!

206
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,633
So, I'm assuming
you all read the chapters

207
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,169
on the Greek Revival
architecture.

208
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,103
Any questions?

209
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,271
Yes.
How do you sleep at night?

210
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,733
What are you doing here?
It was recently made clear to me

211
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,835
that I don't know the first
thing about architecture,

212
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,804
so here I am.

213
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:55,323
Very well, then,
let's get started.

214
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,511
(clears throat)

215
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:58,613
Some examples of Greek Revival
architecture...

216
00:07:58,614 --> 00:07:59,581
Ooh! Ooh!

217
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:02,318
Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?

218
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,420
No.

219
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:06,890
What's The Arcadian?

220
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,159
Oh, it's just this
beautiful, old building

221
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,428
that Professor Mosby
wants to tear down.

222
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:12,563
BETTY:
What?! No,

223
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:14,531
Professor Mosby
loves old buildings.

224
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:16,467
He wouldn't do that.
Right, Ted?

225
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,604
Getting back to Greek Revival...

226
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:22,938
I lost them.

227
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,707
Look, you're new at teaching.

228
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,908
In my kindergarten class,

229
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:28,577
I have had plenty
of troublesome students.

230
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:30,912
Like Johnny Marley...

231
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:33,280
(boy shouting playfully)

232
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:35,783
Johnny?

233
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,019
Johnny!

234
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,223
He and that little stuffed
horsey raised all kinds of hell.

235
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:45,593
But I have a simple method for
shutting down troublemakers.

236
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:48,763
You know that '98 Taurus
that's always parked outside?

237
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:50,898
The one with the really
annoying alarm?

238
00:08:50,899 --> 00:09:00,307
(both mimicking long, complex
car alarm blaring)

239
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,343
We're familiar with it.

240
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:05,312
Well, when a kid like Johnny
acts up in my class...

241
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,847
(kids laughing and shouting
playfully)

242
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:15,856
(mimicking long, complex
car alarm blaring)

243
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,159
Shuts them right up.
TED: Lily,

244
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,495
my students are adults,
and I treat them that way.

245
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:24,197
I'll just give them more candy
and make them a mix CD.

246
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,766
Problem solved.

247
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,768
Oh, baby, what's wrong?

248
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:31,339
Something bad happened.

249
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,242
(knocking)
Randy, hey, have you seen the...

250
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,643
Before you get to that,

251
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,912
regarding the earlier project
I was working on...

252
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:39,347
Voilà!

253
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:40,782
That's the Hermanson contract?

254
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:42,350
The Hermanson contract?

255
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,986
Oh, man, this is
the Filbert contract.

256
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,389
Damn it!
No...

257
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,691
Anyway, what's your thing?

258
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,426
I need the Filbert contract!

259
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:53,595
No!!

260
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:57,833
Well, I'll do what I can.

261
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:02,138
But in my experience, twice
shredded is fairly permanent.

262
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,576
Sorry, Randy, but...

263
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:07,644
this just isn't working out.

264
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:10,581
Marshall popped his cherry!
(popping)
Oh!

265
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:13,751
Come on, Marshall, you have to
admit, the guy was a disaster.

266
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:16,154
I mean, it reflected badly
on the company.

267
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:18,523
He was an embarrassment.

268
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:19,891
A huge embarrassment.

269
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,394
(pounds table)
You slept with Randy!

270
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:23,562
What?!

271
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:26,431
Why, it's elementary,
my dear Scherbatson.

272
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:29,134
LILY:
<i>Your co-host</i>
<i>is getting super-popular</i>

273
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:31,003
<i>because of her stupid</i>
<i>commercial,</i>

274
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,471
<i>"Boats! Boats! Boats!"</i>

275
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:35,374
So, when you arrived at the GNB
<i>party</i> <i>after we left,</i>

276
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,510
<i>you were feeling vulnerable</i>
<i>and drunk.</i>

277
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:42,414
<i>Then, from across the</i>
<i>not-so-crowded conference room,</i>

278
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:44,450
<i>your eyes met.</i>

279
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:50,689
<i>And as we all remember...</i>

280
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,057
<i>Randy has a unique condition.</i>

281
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:55,428
Yeah, your nose is bleeding
like a faucet.

282
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,131
Oh, God, this happens
every time I get an erection.

283
00:10:58,132 --> 00:10:59,465
I am so sorry.

284
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:03,770
That's...

285
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,308
...exactly what happened.

286
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,309
BARNEY:
See, Marshall,

287
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,577
if getting fired
is an execution,

288
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,947
at least the guy
had a last meal.

289
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:14,115
I promise you,

290
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,950
tomorrow you'll feel
a lot better.

291
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:19,720
Randy, hey, what's going on?

292
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,188
I just wanted to say
no hard feelings.

293
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:24,224
(sighs)
Thank you.

294
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,192
So where you headed now?

295
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,796
Downtown.

296
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,501
No!!

297
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:36,569
(gasps)

298
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,404
It's okay, baby.

299
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,840
<i>It wasn't okay.</i>

300
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:41,141
<i>So the next morning...</i>

301
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:43,577
Arthur, I'm here
because I made a mistake.

302
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,012
I fired Randy yesterday.

303
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,080
That was a mistake.

304
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,749
You should have fired him
a year ago.

305
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,686
No, sir, that is what's
wrong with this company.

306
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,788
How can we say "GNB Cares,"

307
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:55,424
and then turn around
and treat someone like that?

308
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,092
I mean, sure,
he made a few mistakes,

309
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,427
but everybody makes mistakes.

310
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:00,629
Like, like Tugboat here.

311
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,132
Aw. I bet you
he's made some mistakes.

312
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,667
And you didn't fire Tugboat,
did you?

313
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:08,103
No, I got him fixed,
and he calmed down.

314
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:10,172
Exactly-- kind of.

315
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:11,641
Randy doesn't need to be fired.

316
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:13,242
He needs to be fixed.

317
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:16,546
Marshall, we do some pretty bad
things around here, but I...

318
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:18,815
No, sir, I'm saying instead
of getting rid of someone

319
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:22,019
when they screw up, we should...
we should help them.

320
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,888
We should nurture them.

321
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,357
Oh...

322
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:31,296
I changed the ice pack
on his crotch

323
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:33,064
every hour for three days.

324
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:39,303
Wow, Eriksen, if you want to
un-fire Randy, I support you,

325
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,604
because to come in here
and say what you just said,

326
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:44,040
well, you've got a couple
things that Tugboat doesn't.

327
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:47,843
(angry shouting)

328
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:51,447
Guys, Prof Rock is
a really good mix, okay?

329
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:53,749
A piece of New York history
is being torn down,

330
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,086
and all you could say
was "Boo freakin' hoo"?

331
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,188
Boo... freakin'...

332
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,057
I may have mentioned
our conversation

333
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:01,892
over a session of hacky sack.

334
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,861
The one day I miss
the sack circle,

335
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,763
you guys sub her in?

336
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:06,964
Why'd you miss?

337
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:09,334
Too busy tearing down
the Statue of Liberty?

338
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:14,440
No. I was returning a hot dog
costume that you all enjoyed.

339
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:15,440
(angry shouting)

340
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:18,110
<i>They were all</i>
<i>turning against me,</i>

341
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,111
<i>so I figured, what the hell.</i>

342
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,280
(shouting continues)

343
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:34,225
(mimicking long, complex
car alarm blaring)

344
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:35,193
And did it work?

345
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,327
Like gangbusters.

346
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:37,262
We're buddies again.

347
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,964
After class, we
hacked a little sack

348
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,100
to the thumpin' strains
of my Prof Rock CD.

349
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:43,436
And no, none of them had
heard the Pixies B-side.

350
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,739
Actually, none of them
had heard of the Pixies.

351
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,007
Or a B-side.

352
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,776
Hey, guys.

353
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,344
Uh-oh. I know that smile.

354
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:52,480
Lily, there's no easy way
to say this.

355
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:53,715
Marshall's dead.

356
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:55,283
Randy murdered him.

357
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:58,086
No. I know why
Randy is smiling.

358
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,555
You're smiling
because of Robin.

359
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,659
Robin? Like how I think about
her when I'm in the shower?

360
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,127
I'm trying to eat
here, buddy.

361
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:08,397
No. Because you slept
with her on Halloween.

362
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:10,298
What? No.

363
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,668
I went home, had a shower
an-and went to bed.

364
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:14,736
You didn't sleep with her?

365
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,271
No.

366
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,472
Even in the shower,

367
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:19,307
the farthest we ever get
is hugging.

368
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,843
So why are
you smiling?

369
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:23,378
I'll tell you why.

370
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,648
This just isn't working out.

371
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:28,383
RANDY:
<i>I'm fired. Great.</i>

372
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:32,221
<i>This is the candle kiosk</i>
<i>at the mall all over again.</i>

373
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:33,589
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

374
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,658
<i>I can get a severance check.</i>

375
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,561
<i>If I don't shred it,</i>

376
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:40,631
<i>I can use that money to start</i>
<i>my own brewery.</i>

377
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:43,234
<i>Imagine a beer</i>
<i>with my name on it.</i>

378
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:47,305
<i>Randy Wharmpiss, this is</i>
<i>the best day of your life.</i>

379
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:50,776
Thanks to that severance check,

380
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:52,945
this time next year,
you'll all be enjoying

381
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,647
a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.

382
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,615
MARSHALL:
Randy, great news!

383
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,083
You're not fired!

384
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:05,357
(wailing):
No...!

385
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:08,727
Good morning, everybody...

386
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,566
Where's my class?

387
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,034
(angry shouting)

388
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,436
Hello, Professor.

389
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,573
Ha-boom.

390
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:25,481
I got you your
job back, Randy.

391
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,014
I thought that you'd be happy.

392
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:28,515
But I don't belong here.

393
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:31,351
I'm born to be a brewer!
A... a hopsmeister!

394
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:33,453
Well, then quit.
No one's stopping you.

395
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,621
I-I can't.
I need my severance check.

396
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:38,024
Well, I'm sorry Randy,
but that's called fraud.

397
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,458
It's not fraud.

398
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:40,826
I'm just asking you to get me

399
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:42,194
a lot of money to not work here

400
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:43,595
and not tell anyone about it.

401
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:46,097
Even if I wanted to fire you,
after my talk with Arthur...

402
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:48,600
Oh, come on,
Arthur can't remember that.

403
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:51,169
Marshall, what a memorable
talk we had yesterday.

404
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,607
Randy, on behalf of everyone at
GNB, both in and out of prison,

405
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,142
we're sorry.

406
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:58,610
And I want to assure you

407
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,078
you will never
be fired again.

408
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,514
You're going to work
here until you die, huh?

409
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:03,515
Huh?

410
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:04,916
Green tie?

411
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,218
(clears throat)

412
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,653
Nice choice.

413
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,354
Thanks. It brings
out my eyes.

414
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:11,857
Yeah. I'll bring
out your eyes.

415
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,626
Listen, Randy, I'm sorry,

416
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:16,394
but I broke
my own moral code once

417
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:18,029
and I felt evil.

418
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,797
I will not let GNB change me.

419
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:23,900
I will never fire
anyone again ever.

420
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,736
Oh, we'll see about that.

421
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:31,241
Anyhoo, while I got you--

422
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,709
big smile.

423
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,845
"We care about
making dreams come true,"

424
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:36,280
in three, two...

425
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,082
No!

426
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,150
What are you doing?

427
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:41,652
Oh, are you unhappy
with my performance?

428
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:43,954
Well, I guess I'm fired, then.
I'd better turn in my I.D.

429
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:46,957
No, it's actually, um, nice

430
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,760
having some of this clutter
off my desk.

431
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,227
So thank you, Randy.

432
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,935
And there's more.

433
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,206
I don't know
what I'm going to use this for,

434
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:01,307
but it's great stuff.

435
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,742
Now am I fired?

436
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,647
I've been meaning to clean out
that file cabinet for ages.

437
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:08,915
I'm not even here.

438
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,484
Randy, the coffee.

439
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:12,953
Oh! Okay.

440
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:14,622
Okay.

441
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,057
Thank you, Randy.

442
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:19,394
I've been meaning to cut back
on my caffeine.

443
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,596
Here, try this,
but really go for it.

444
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:23,265
Remember, this guy
ruined your life.

445
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:32,207
That's just
the pick-me-up I needed.

446
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:36,745
Speaking of pickups, can we try
the first one again?

447
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:39,181
(phone ringing)

448
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:40,181
Hello.

449
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:41,583
It didn't work. They hate me.

450
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,651
How do I get them
to like me again?

451
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:44,785
You don't.

452
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,320
Ted, you're their teacher.

453
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:48,389
The only people that
like their teachers...

454
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,423
I like my teachers.

455
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:51,024
...are dorks.

456
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:52,626
Except for you, Miles.

457
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:57,933
Ted, you just have to learn
to embrace their hatred.

458
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,603
Because behind that hatred
lies fear.

459
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:01,704
And you can use

460
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,841
use that fear,
like I did with Johnny Marley.

461
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:06,309
Was there more to that story?

462
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,411
A little bit.

463
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:25,994
(sustained screaming)

464
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:28,829
Lily, you're a psychopath.

465
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,031
A little bit.

466
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:32,600
Oh, a panda!

467
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,837
I thought about Lily's advice.

468
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:40,942
<i>And I figured fear</i>
<i>was worth a try.</i>

469
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:42,877
Well, Professor Mosby,

470
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:44,479
is there anything
you want to say to us?

471
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,884
Anyone not in class tomorrow
gets an "F."

472
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:53,355
You said that?

473
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:55,024
Well, technically,
they'd get an incomplete,

474
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,627
but I thought "F" had a nice,
scary ring to it.

475
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:58,695
Right?
Yeah.

476
00:18:58,696 --> 00:18:59,896
Hey, guys.
Hey.

477
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,097
Robin, who'd you sleep with?

478
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,766
I told you-- Randy.

479
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,568
He was a machine.

480
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,937
Where's the poop, Robin?

481
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,071
(sighs)

482
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:10,907
Fine. I didn't sleep
with anyone.

483
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:13,242
The thing is, ever since
Becky did that commercial,

484
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:15,077
everyone at work loves her.

485
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:18,180
So, the day after Halloween,
I was in a commercial.

486
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,215
What... Why didn't you tell us?

487
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,818
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Bladder trouble--</i>
<i>it's embarrassing,</i>

488
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:27,021
<i>it's uncomfortable,</i>
<i>and it can affect anyone.</i>

489
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:29,757
I'm going to the bathroom
right now.

490
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:32,026
Neat and discreet adult diapers

491
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,294
<i>for anyone.</i>

492
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,496
Say...

493
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:37,333
"Ah..."

494
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,505
(laughing)
(Ted laughing)

495
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:45,876
Wow! I can't wait to see it.

496
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,044
Well, hopefully
you never will.

497
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,045
They said that they
might not even use it.

498
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,513
TED:
<i>It ran for seven years.</i>

499
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,584
Okay, you win.

500
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:57,687
Maybe trashing your office
was a mistake.

501
00:19:57,688 --> 00:20:00,824
It's just,
uh, as long as I can remember,

502
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,126
making beer has been my dream.

503
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:06,162
Wharmpiss?

504
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:10,066
I know
it sounds dumb

505
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:12,836
to someone who's already
achieved his dream--

506
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,805
big-time lawyer
at a huge corporation.

507
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:17,208
You think working here
is my dream?

508
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:18,409
Of course.

509
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:21,913
Anyways, I'll clean
this stuff up.

510
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:24,549
Have someone get that dead
squirrel out of your desk.

511
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,620
Randy.

512
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:31,956
This is delicious.

513
00:20:33,225 --> 00:20:35,526
You're fired.

514
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,595
<i>Kids, the next morning--</i>

515
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:43,765
<i>my class had the highest</i>
<i>attendance it had ever had.</i>

516
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,767
<i>And not long after that,</i>

517
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:48,337
Randy used his severance money
<i>to start a little brewery.</i>

518
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:52,607
<i>Now you can have a Wharmpiss</i>
<i>at every bar in America.</i>

519
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,642
<i>And all because...</i>

520
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:57,412
I care about
making dreams come true.

521
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:59,581
You got what you need?

522
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,549
BARNEY:
Yep. That's a wrap.
