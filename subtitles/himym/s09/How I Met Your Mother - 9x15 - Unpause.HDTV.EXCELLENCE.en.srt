1
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:05,030
Labor sucks, huh?
Yeah.

2
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:06,531
That fun-sounding name?

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,166
It's totally misleading.

4
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:10,385
Better have this baby soon.

5
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,187
You know my
mom's rule:

6
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:14,389
Nothing good happens
after 2:00 a.m.

7
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,474
I don't buy it.

8
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:18,010
Just like I don't buy
what her son told me:

9
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:19,611
"Let's go away
for one last weekend

10
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:20,946
"before the baby comes.

11
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:22,564
We'll be fine!"

12
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:24,483
Well, I hate
to point fingers,

13
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,618
but you should
never listen to me.

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,819
You know that.

15
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,204
That's my bad.

16
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:32,273
Oh!

17
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,709
Here comes  another one.
Already?

18
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:34,876
Yeah. Yeah yep.
Okay, okay, okay.

19
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:36,611
We should get you to
the hospital. Come on.

20
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:37,963
Okay.

21
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,131
Oh, here we go.

22
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,584
Sho-sho-shoes,
baby-baby-baby...

23
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,672
You guys can't still see where
Marshall slapped me, can you?

24
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:50,342
Your face looks like
a "don't walk" signal.

25
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:51,727
Your face looks like
a photo negative

26
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,011
of the Hamburger Helper box.

27
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:54,846
A palm reader could
tell Marshall's future

28
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:56,481
by studying your face.

29
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,800
The phrase "talk to the hand
'cause the face ain't listening"

30
00:00:58,802 --> 00:00:59,901
doesn't work for you

31
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,853
because the hand
is on your face.

32
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,573
A simple "yes"
would've sufficed.

33
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:06,658
Oh, baby,

34
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,309
I missed you so much.

35
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,861
I am so angry!

36
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,647
I am gonna tear you
apart tonight.

37
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:13,865
I am gonna
tear you

38
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,367
apart tonight!
Okay, okay.

39
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:16,985
Look, we said
that we wouldn't fight

40
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:19,638
until the gang was all done
hanging out, remember?

41
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,823
<i>Ever since Lily</i>
<i>heard that Marshall</i>

42
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,491
<i>had accepted an offer</i>
<i>to be a judge,</i>

43
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:25,961
<i>thus jeopardizing</i>
<i>their planned year in Italy,</i>

44
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,813
<i>they both knew</i>
<i>a big fight was coming.</i>

45
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:30,148
<i>But when they finally</i>
<i>saw each other...</i>

46
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,000
Pause?

47
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:33,435
Pause.

48
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:35,720
<i>See, Lily and Marshall</i>
<i>had a long tradition</i>

49
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,773
<i>of hitting "pause"</i>
<i>on their arguments.</i>

50
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,674
<i>Sometimes they paused because</i>

51
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:41,810
<i>they suddenly had</i>
<i>other things to do.</i>

52
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:43,995
We have to stick
to our budget! Okay?

53
00:01:43,997 --> 00:01:45,981
You cannot be out there
buying all these

54
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:47,732
Brazilian bikini waxes

55
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,517
and Kama Sutra body oils

56
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,169
and edible...
Pause.

57
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,539
<i>Sometimes, they paused</i>
<i>to keep their fights</i>

58
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,158
<i>from subtly changing subjects.</i>

59
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,692
Baby, I cannot
put up with

60
00:01:57,694 --> 00:01:59,828
your shoes being
all over the house!

61
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,880
Why not? I put up with
your terrible mother.

62
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,332
Pause!
Pause.

63
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,834
<i>And now that they were paused,</i>

64
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:07,719
<i>Marshall realized</i>
<i>he would do anything</i>

65
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:10,005
<i>to stay paused</i>
<i>for as long as he could.</i>

66
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:11,706
Okay, time
to go to bed.

67
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,841
Big day tomorrow.

68
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:13,809
Big day tomorrow!
Big day tomorrow!

69
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:14,893
Screw tomorrow!

70
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:16,094
We go big tonight, huh?

71
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,897
We go big tonight!
We go big tonight!

72
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:20,482
I mean, uh...

73
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,733
come on, you know, uh,

74
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:23,985
what time
is it, anyway?

75
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,439

77
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,570
Hey, where's
the baby?

78
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,874
The elevator!
The elevator!

79
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:48,576
Ah, that joke just
never gets old.

80
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,912
And it's not at all inspired
by real-life events.

81
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:52,697
No, it is not.
Mm-mm.

82
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:54,916
Anyway, the sitter has
Marvin for the night.

83
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,051
Ooh!

84
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:58,220
And now...
the best thing

85
00:02:58,222 --> 00:02:59,905
to come out of my
cross-country trip:

86
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:01,723
a little segment I like to call

87
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:05,527
"Embarrassing Souvenirs I Picked
Up From Ted's Childhood Home."

88
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:11,183
"Totally
Awesome Ted."

89
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:13,201
What, did you steal this off
some other kid named Ted?

90
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:14,569
I'm just getting
warmed up here.

91
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,037
This is fun.

92
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,939
We're all...
you know, it's...

93
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:19,274
I'm having fun.

94
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:21,877
When you squeeze this toy,
a recording of Ted says,

95
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,129
"I wuv you, Mommy!"

96
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,247
Oh, but
that's sweet!

97
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:27,132
Why would we make
fun of him for that?

98
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,950
He gave it to her
when he was 19.

99
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,402
I wuv you, Mommy.

100
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:35,957
And lastly, a photo
of young Ted

101
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,927
and his best friend
dressed up like cowboys.

102
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:39,928
No, oh, all right.

103
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,246
Leave him alone.

104
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:42,731
His best friend
was a balloon.

105
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:43,732
I want to see that picture

106
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:44,974
more than I want
to get married!

107
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,737
I hate you so much.

108
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,574
Oo yah maya stupa koon!

109
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,609
Ho ho ho!

110
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,177
<i>Over the years, we'd seen</i>

111
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,496
<i>all sorts of levels</i>
<i>of Barney's drunkenness.</i>

112
00:03:58,498 --> 00:03:59,814
How you doin'?

113
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,116
<i>"Richard Dawson drunk..."</i>

114
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:02,918
Ah, is this
your sister?

115
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,837
<i>"Big plans with strangers</i>
<i>drunk..."</i>

116
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:06,838
Hey!

117
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
Me and the Road Dawgs

118
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:11,159
going splitsies on a time share
in Flint, Michigan!

119
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:13,161
And...

120
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:15,330
non-refundably booked!

121
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:17,933
Come on! I'm gonna buy
you all some mopeds!

122
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,050
Road Dawgs!

123
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:21,353
<i>And "Marcel Marceau drunk..."</i>

124
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,440
<i>But we knew the night was over</i>
<i>whenever Barney got...</i>

125
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:26,474
<i>"Jabba drunk."</i>

126
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>So drunk that his speech</i>

127
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:30,362
<i>bore an uncanny</i>
<i>resemblance to that of...</i>

128
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:33,648
<i>Jabba the Hutt from</i>
Return of the Jedi.

129
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,816
Bo shuda!

130
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:35,850
Ha ha ha!

131
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,819
Okay, we have to go to bed.

132
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:38,770
Big day tomorrow.

133
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:39,904
Big day tomorrow!
Noon-eeg Han Solo!

134
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,022
Screw tomorrow!

135
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:42,857
Let's go big tonight!

136
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:44,876
We go big tonight!
Ah wotto potto tapa ho!

137
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:47,195
No, Marshall, let's go now.

138
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,980
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

139
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:50,548
Look, I-I guess we
have to do this.

140
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,818
Okay, first off, I know how
important Italy was to you...

141
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,887
Shut up and do me!

142
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,008
Okay, we have
to go to bed.

143
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,176
Yeah.

144
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,079
Yeah.
I need to get

145
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,147
my ear hair trimmed
in the morning.

146
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:08,149
It's like a rain forest
in there.

147
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:10,885
Uh, why would you volunteer
that information?

148
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:12,187
Because it's the truth.

149
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,857
Also, I peed a little
on my tie at the urinal.

150
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:18,059
Uh, Barney...

151
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:19,727
me or you?

152
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,997
You're taller.
I wear lifts in all my shoes.

153
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:23,365
Oh, my God, Robin...

154
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,684
Barney has reached
a whole new level.

155
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:27,869
He's "truth serum drunk."

156
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:29,387
He can't lie.

157
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,206
So we can finally
get the answers

158
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,874
we've always
been wondering about.

159
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,259
Look, I know you said
you had to go to bed,

160
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:35,293
but I really think...

161
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,761
Screw tomorrow!

162
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:37,896
We go big tonight.

163
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:39,547
Yeah.

164
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,866
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.

165
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:43,918
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

166
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,886
We're not unpaused?

167
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:45,970
Not yet.

168
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,305
Mama needs some Papa.

169
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,723
But as soon as we're
done having sex,

170
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:49,757
we are having that fight!

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,526
Wait, so we're...

172
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,761
not gonna fight

173
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,731
until after we're
done having sex.

174
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,933
Challenge accepted.

175
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:02,994
Um, so... just,
just to be clear,

176
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:04,873
after we finish
having sex,

177
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,458
that's when we'll
have our fight?

178
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,476
That's right.

179
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:09,645
Excuse me.

180
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,919
Okay, Marshall.

181
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:19,254
It's go time.

182
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,256
You've had great nights
of sex before,

183
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:22,891
most of them with Lily,

184
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,593
a few by yourself--

185
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,345
and we'll always have that

186
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:28,647
Unscrambled Spice Channel
Glitch of '93--

187
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,350
but this has got to be
the performance of a lifetime.

188
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,185
Jimi Hendrix at Monterey.

189
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:35,404
James Brown at the Apollo.

190
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,522
Your law school funk band
pretty much anywhere.

191
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,358
So get out there

192
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,778
and bang your wife for
as long as you possibly can!

193
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:48,149
Not a good sign that
I'm already out of breath.

194
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,505
So... Barney will answer

195
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,525
any question we ask him
with the truth?

196
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:57,809
I think so.

197
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,878
Honey...

198
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,465
when that Bryan Adams song
came on the radio,

199
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,600
did two mosquitoes
really fly into your eyes

200
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:06,635
at the same time?

201
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:08,186
No.

202
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,305
I got all choked up
thinking about how

203
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:13,425
everything he does,
he does it for her.

204
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:14,893
Checks out.

205
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,027
Okay, what next?

206
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,345
I mean, it's...

207
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:18,680
it's so hard to know
where to begin.

208
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:19,681
I mean, there are so many...

209
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:21,182
What did you do to my mom?!

210
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,735
<i>Well, that night,</i>

211
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,570
<i>we were in my car...</i>

212
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:26,972
I was wrong!
I can't handle this!

213
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,974
Uh, just tell me
in baseball terms.

214
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:31,192
I got thrown out
trying to stretch

215
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:32,527
a single into a double.

216
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,466
I can live with that.

217
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,702
How about that time
you walked into the bar

218
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:42,621
wearing "Triple-X-Ray Goggles"?

219
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,041
Well, hello,
you two lovely ladies.

220
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:48,226
What are you wearing?

221
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:49,428
Oh, hey, Robin,
didn't see you there.

222
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,547
Just Triple-X-Ray Goggles, no big deal.
Oh...

223
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:54,766
There is no way
those things work.

224
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:56,485
I'm not even here.

225
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,353
Just act natural.

226
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:02,941
Right.

227
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:05,410
'Cause that jacket's
made of lead.

228
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:07,746
Those things
didn't work, did they?

229
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:10,282
Absolutely. Lily's boobs
always work for me.

230
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,867
Oh, the goggles?
No.

231
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:14,286
Next question.

232
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:17,506
You keep saying "ring bear"

233
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:20,074
instead of ring bear-er.

234
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:23,378
Will there or will there not

235
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,430
be a bear at our wedding?

236
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,966
The truth is...

238
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,570
Wumby flappy snurp...

00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:33,171
Oh, my God, he's dipped back
down to Jabba drunk!

240
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:34,255
Give him
another drink!

241
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:36,107
Come on.

242
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:38,259
Oh, yeah, baby.

243
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:40,111

I know that you always say

that you don't
need any kind of

277
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,695
"help" in bed,

278

I always keep
these on hand.

279
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:06,815
But be
careful.

280
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,234

281

Thank you.

00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:15,189

<i>Kids, I won't bother you</i>

284
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:19,961
<i>but it was a crapload.</i>

285
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,813
Around one crapload.

286
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,164
That much?

287
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,716
Well... aren't you concerned
about your future?

288
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:25,867
Nope.

289
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:27,836
Especially since Robin
is massively wealthy.

290
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:29,271
Barney!
What?

291
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,422
You're rich?

292
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:31,573
L-Like how rich?

293
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:32,841
It's my family's money,
not mine.

294
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:33,892
I-I don't really know how much.

295
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,260
How much is her family worth?

296
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,845
6,000 craploads.

297
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,212
Canadian craploads.

298
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:39,547
That much?!

299
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:40,548
But when
we dated,

300
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,883
I paid for everything.

301
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,501
You didn't pay for everything.

302
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:44,486
He paid for everything.

303
00:10:44,488 --> 00:10:46,371
I pick up our bar tab
all the time.

304
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,023
Three times
in the last nine years.

305
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:50,191
I took you out to tons
of four-star restaurants.

306
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:51,276
Two-star restaurants.

307
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,061
Figuring, on average,
two meals out a week

308
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:54,562
plus 20% tip...

309
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:55,780
12 and a half percent tip.

310
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:58,083
Do you know
how much money you cost me?

311
00:10:58,085 --> 00:10:59,434
What am I?
A prostitute?

312
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:00,919
You are not a prostitute.

313
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,004
No, a prostitute
would've been cheaper.

314
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:04,990
Depends on the prostitute.

315
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:07,158
Wait, hold on, Ted
What are we doing?

316
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,576
You're arguing
about Robin's wealth

317
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:11,046
when you really should be asking
me embarrassing questions.

318
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,597
He's right.

319
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,515
Let's do this.

320
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:14,966
<i>And so we did it.</i>

321
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:16,668
<i>We asked Barney</i>
<i>all the questions</i>

322
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,652
<i>we'd always wanted to.</i>

323
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:20,355
In one night? Four.

324
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,991
In one family? Three.

325
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:26,361
Yes, but not while she
was secretary of state.

326
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:29,981
Yes, but not while <i>she</i> was
secretary of state.

327
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,399
Just once.

328
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,435
With a French male model Henri.

329
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:35,704
It was late.

330
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,622
We were the last two people
in the club.

331
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:40,075
I was lonely and I figured,
why not try it?

332
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:44,145
That was the only time
I ever split a cab.

333
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:46,998
Yes, but not the M.I.T.
you're thinking of.

334
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,884
The Magician's Institute
of Teaneck.

335
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:53,588
I've had sex
in Ted's bed 14 times.

336
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,125
I asked if you wear
shoulder pads.

337
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,644
I think I've just got
one question left.

338
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:01,212
And it's a biggie.

339
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:04,315
Barney Stinson...

340
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:06,568
...what do you do for a living?

341
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:10,505
You did it.

342
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:13,307
You banged your wife to sleep.

343
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:15,493
Nice job...

344
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,831
Still-Big Fudge.

345
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:24,619
I wuv you, Mommy.

346
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:25,787
Unpause.

347
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,606
<i>Kids, in all the time</i>
<i>we knew Barney,</i>

348
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:34,658
<i>there was one question he would</i>
<i>always answer the same way.</i>

349
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,393
Seriously, what is it
that you do?

350
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,778
Please.

351
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,745
Okay, seriously.

352
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:40,414
What do you do for a living?

353
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,049
Please.

354
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:44,284
Are you finally gonna tell me
exactly what your job is?

355
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:45,953
Please.

356
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:48,772
<i>So, naturally, this was</i>
<i>a pretty big moment for us.</i>

357
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:52,742
Well, what do you do

358
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,081
Please.

359
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,349
God, he's not telling us.

360
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,350
More booze.

361
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:02,803
Not so fast, princess.

362
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,638
I guess subtle clues
and the bar tab

363
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,607
are two things
you just don't pick up.

364
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:07,757
Because...

365
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,227
I think he is telling us.

366
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:12,529
Tell us more about this job.

367
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:14,681
<i>Well, as you know,</i>

368
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:16,283
<i>back in my hippie days,</i>

369
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:18,235
<i>a business man came</i>
<i>into my coffee shop,</i>

370
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,070
<i>told me money was</i>
<i>all that mattered,</i>

371
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,488
<i>and stole my girlfriend.</i>

372
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,108
<i>That's when I decided</i>
<i>to become awesome.</i>

373
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,645
<i>But I had no idea how to break</i>
<i>into the corporate world.</i>

374
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,047
<i>So, hoping he wouldn't</i>
<i>recognize me,</i>

375
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,781
<i>I went to the one person</i>
<i>from whom</i>

376
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:34,384
<i>I knew I could learn</i>
<i>everything.</i>

377
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:35,802
Do we know each other, bro?

378
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:39,473
We're all connected
in Gaia's great tapestry of...

379
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,558
No.

380
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,893
We don't.

381
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,728
Bro.

382
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,347
Wow, you went to M.I.T.

383
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,515
Pretty impressive.

384
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:51,401
I did get a perfect score
on the A.C.T.'s.

385
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:54,404
Advanced Card Tricks.

386
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:55,606
Well, look, buddy.

387
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,107
You got a sweet résumé.

388
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,192
But we don't have any openings
you're qualified for.

389
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:01,862
They set me up!
It was a trap! It's a trap!

390
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:06,466
We have one opening
you'd be perfect for.

391
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:08,535
Great. What do I do?

392
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,621
Please.

393
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:13,040
"Provide Legal Exculpation
And Sign Everything."

394
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,257
Just show up every day,

395
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,976
scribble your name on
a bunch of documents,

396
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:18,011
and we'll pay you
16 craploads a year.

397
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:20,297
Deets are in the contract.

398
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,739
I'll give you time
to think about it.

399
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,718
I'll take it.

400
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,769
Hold on.

401
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,421
Did you even read this
before signing it?

402
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:28,388
No.

403
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,723
You're hired.

404
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,276
We'll work on that.

405
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,645
<i>Wait.</i>

406
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:35,646
That's your job?

407
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:37,864
You sign sketchy,
legally binding documents

408
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:40,017
that could implicate you
for God knows what?

409
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,169
Best job ever, right?

410
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:45,455
No more pausing.

411
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,157
We're getting
through this argument.

412
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,042
Okay.

413
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:51,011
No potshots at my mom.

414
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:52,796
Fine, no distracting me
with your calves.

415
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:54,998
Fine.

416
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:01,054
Look, I love you, Lilypad.

417
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,723
I love you, Marshmallow.

418
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,641
Now...

419
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:09,613
...how could you take
that job without telling me?!

420
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,564
Baby, I'm sorry, but they needed
an answer right away.

421
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,681
This is a huge opportunity,

422
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:15,400
it could be very good
for our family,

423
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:17,352
and we have to
at least talk about it.

424
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:20,104
Sorry, you lost your chance
to talk about it

425
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,156
when you didn't talk about it.

426
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,475
We're going to Italy.

427
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:25,943
But I could be a judge.

428
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:29,080
We can't give that up for
what is clearly just a hobby.

429
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,248
Pause.

430
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,499
No pause.

431
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:33,484
That "hobby" is my dream.

432
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,169
We're going to Italy.

433
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:36,254
But it's my dream to...

434
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:37,505
We are going to Italy!

435
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:38,873
Baby, can you just...?

436
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,508
We are going to Italy!

437
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,709
Don't you get it?

438
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,878
You went behind my back.

439
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,596
You hurt me.

440
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:49,567
You were more selfish
than I have ever been to you.

441
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:54,472
You broke up with me
and moved to San Francisco.

442
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,392
Barney!
You're being stupid.

443
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,894
The-the-the company is
setting you up as their fall guy

444
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,480
for all of their
illegal activities.

445
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:05,316
No, you guys are being stupid.

446
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,868
Especially Ted.

447
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,453
What? I didn't say anything.

448
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:12,240
<i>And then, kids, Barney revealed</i>
<i>to us his master plan.</i>

449
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,776
<i>It all went down a few months</i>
<i>after the wedding.</i>

450
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,694
Hey, Greg?

451
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,046
I know you're busy,

452
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:20,114
but FYI, I've been colluding
with the Feds.

453
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,382
They know everything.

454
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:22,917
And they're
on their way up right now

455
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,552
to shut down this division
and arrest you.

456
00:16:24,554 --> 00:16:25,887
Door closed or...?

457
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,221
What?

458
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:28,589
Why would you do that?

459
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:31,225
Oh, gosh,
countless moral reasons...

460
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:32,643
could have applied,

461
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:36,431
but this is pretty much revenge
for stealing my girlfriend.

462
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,048
<i>See? That day, I vowed</i>

463
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,551
<i>I would do everything</i>
<i>in my power to track you down,</i>

464
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,270
<i>gain your trust,</i>

465
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:45,022
<i>and then destroy you.</i>

466
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,324
Who are you?

467
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,358
Who am I?

468
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,026
Just a guy who served you

469
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:50,561
coffee once.

470
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:51,846
Peace out, loser.

00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:53,698

Barney Stinson ♪

472
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,333

476

Why are you

477
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:06,594
bringing up San Francisco?

478
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:08,629
That was seven years ago.

479
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,581
Because you are being

480
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,967
selfish all over again.

481
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:14,852
Marshall, I apologized

482
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:17,421
over and over again.

483
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:20,141
Now you're saying you
never have forgiven me?

484
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:21,275
There is

485
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:24,195
nothing more important to me
than our family.

486
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:25,446
You know that.

487
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,697
Well, let me ask.

488
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,233
What if you had found
success in San Francisco?

489
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,452
How do I know that you even

490
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:32,670
would've come back to me?

491
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,438
Stop it.

492
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,907
Are Marvin and I

493
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,543
and any other future children
we may have

494
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,129
just some consolation prize?

495
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:43,297
I have to get out of here.

496
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:46,584
Babe?

497
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,087
So, Barney,

498
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,589
I still haven't
heard you pronounce

499
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:53,007
that last syllable.

500
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,228
At our wedding, will there be

501
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,680
a ring bear-er?

502
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,934
The truth is...

503
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:06,838
...yes, there will be
a ring bear-er.

504
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,823
His name is Trevor Hudson,

505
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,958
I worked with his mother,
and he's adorable.

506
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,778
I want our wedding
to be perfect, Robin.

507
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,613
Me, too.

508
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:17,648
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.

509
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,783
He's okay to crash
with you, right?

510
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,868
Yup, we'll see you
in the morning.

511
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,537
Hmm.

512
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,704
I love you.

513
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,506
I love you, too.

514
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:32,296
Okay, I got one last question
for you.

515
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,398
And I can't believe
I haven't asked it yet.

516
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,034
Dude, you're getting
married tomorrow.

517
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,171
How are you doing?
Good.

518
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,773
I mean, I'm a little nervous,

519
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:46,510
but I love Robin more
than I've ever loved anyone,

520
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:49,130
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to make her happy.

521
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,648
For a long time,

522
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,850
deep down,

523
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:55,019
I've felt sort of...

524
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,788
broken?

525
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,241
I don't feel that way anymore.

526
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,526
Robin, along with the idea

527
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,296
that vengeance
will soon be mine,

528
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:09,133
has made me 100% awesome.

529
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,401
I'm proud of you, buddy.

530
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:13,387
Globan froban.

531
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,472
Ho, ho, ho.

532
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:15,473
Okay.

533
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:16,724
Come on, Jabba.

534
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:17,675
Big day tomorrow.

535
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,844
Tab for the night?

536
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:21,378
Just so you know,

537
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,899
those last few rounds of 35-year
Glen McKenna were not cheap.

538
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:25,983
Whoa.

539
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,051
Um...

540
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:28,402
you know what?

541
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:29,687
Charge them to the bride's room.

542
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:30,855
Thank you.

543
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:31,889
Come on.

544
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:33,824
Let's go. We got you.

545
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:36,577
<i>Kids, it's your</i>
<i>grandmother's favorite rule.</i>

546
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,930
<i>Nothing good happens</i>
<i>after 2:00 a.m.</i>

547
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:42,066
Hi. I-I know it's late,
but I've got to get out of here.

548
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:45,086
Marshall and I
just had a huge fight.

549
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:47,371
You will?

550
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:50,124
Oh, my God, thank you.

551
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,971
Okay, here we go.

552
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,140
You good, yeah?
Yeah.

553
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:08,559
Okay.

554
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,593
Okay.

555
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:10,695
Everything is fine.

556
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:11,779
Okay? Just don't freak out.

557
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:12,763
I'm not freaking out.

558
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:13,781
I was talking to myself.

559
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:15,316
Do you have the baby?

560
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:16,667
The elevator!
What?!

561
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,402
Marshall and Lily are right.
It never gets old.

562
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:19,870
Unless you're crowning.

563
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,706
So proud of you.
Thank you.

564
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,374
Penny is proud of you.

565
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,992
Let's go get you a brother.

566
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:26,594
Okay?
Hmm?

567
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:27,662
You want a brother?
All right?

568
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:29,947
I love you.
I love you, too.

569
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:31,115
You're gonna be great.

570
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:32,266
Yeah, okay.

571
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:34,885
<i>2:00 a.m., it's a good rule,</i>

572
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:37,287
<i>but every rule</i>
<i>has an exception.</i>

573
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:40,057
<i>And for us,</i>
<i>that exception was you, Luke.</i>

574
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,926
We're having a baby!

575
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:50,685
Come on, Trevor Hudson.

576
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,070
It's feeding time.
