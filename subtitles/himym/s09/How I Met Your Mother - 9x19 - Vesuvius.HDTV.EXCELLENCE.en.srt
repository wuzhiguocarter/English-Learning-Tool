1
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,083
Thank you for
bringing me here.

2
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:12,102
I am so glad we made
it. That snowstorm

3
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:13,520
was getting really bad.

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,105
Wait, you think
this is a snowstorm?

5
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:17,724
This is nothing.
I'll tell you about a snowstorm.

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,694
It was winter break,
freshman year of college...

7
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:22,295
<i>Marshall and I were</i>
<i>roommates, but we weren't</i>

8
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:23,897
<i>- really good friends yet.</i>
<i>- Wait, stop.</i>

9
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,365
You've told me this one before.

10
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:26,483
I have? When?

11
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,869
Uh, let's see. It was...

12
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:29,853
all the time.

13
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,289
Really?

14
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,907
You and Marshall
drove back to school...

15
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,642
<i>"500 Miles" played on a loop.</i>

16
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,127
<i>You took a back road,</i>
<i>ran out of gas,</i>

17
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:39,612
<i>got stuck in a snowstorm,</i>
<i>spooned to stay warm--</i>

18
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:40,997
<i>at least that's your story--</i>

19
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,166
<i>and at the end of it,</i>
<i>you were best friends.</i>

20
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,469
Okay. Okay, that's fine,
because guess what.

21
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,888
That wasn't even the worst
snowstorm ever.

22
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,456
It was 2008...

23
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,891
<i>- Barney and I...</i>
<i>- Took over the bar,</i>

24
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:53,059
<i>met the Arizona Tech</i>
<i>marching band-- "Go Hens!"--</i>

25
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:54,394
<i>and they played</i>
<i>"Auld Lang Syne" when Marshall</i>

26
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:56,229
<i>picked up Lily at the airport.</i>

27
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:59,099
Okay. Have I told you about
the time that Marshall...

28
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,518
<i>Tried to put Christmas lights</i>
<i>on Lily's grandparents' house</i>

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,303
<i>and the little ragamuffin from</i>
<i>next door left him stranded</i>

30
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:04,671
<i>on the roof?</i>

31
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,006
Did Lily tell you that one?

32
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:07,407
Yeah.

33
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,110
<i>Lily</i> used the word "ragamuffin."

34
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,297
So I've told you
all my stories.

35
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,333
I'm afraid so.
But luckily

36
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:19,169
I have plenty of stories
that you don't know yet.

37
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,454
Like the one where my
college roommates and I

38
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,655
went to this male strip club...

39
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,507
And your friend Dongnose
got smacked on the nose

40
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:25,792
with a dong?

41
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,743
I know that one.

42
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:29,679
Okay.

43
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:31,715
What about the story
that explains how...

44
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,350
Dongnose got her
nickname "Dongnose"

45
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:35,752
and that it had nothing to do
with the dong-smacking incident?

46
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:37,103
Heard it, loved it,

47
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:40,140
called it the greatest
coincidence of the 21st century.

48
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,342
Wow.

49
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:45,145
You know every one
of my stories.

50
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,281
And you know every one of mine.

51
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:50,617
I guess it's official.

52
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,185
We're an old married couple.

53
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,489
Nice!
We did it!

Well, well, if it

57
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,518
Hi.
Hi.

58
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,555
Here for a romantic weekend
away from the kids.

59
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:19,857
It's a good thing there's no
guests on either side of you,

60
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,059
'cause those bedsprings
are gonna squeak like mice

61
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,361
in a cheese factory.
Am I right?

62
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:26,447
Just don't break any
of the lamps like your friends

63
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:28,649
Barney and Robin, okay?
That's not how the lamp broke.

64
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,734
Of course not. All right,
you have fun, you two.

65
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:33,370
Uh,

66
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:34,605
what lamp is this?

67
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,540
The lamp Robin broke
the day of the wedding.

68
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:38,959
Oh, my God.

69
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,110
You don't know this one.

70
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,112
Oh... man.

71
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:43,747
This is a good one.

72
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:45,299
I mean, it's got everything.

73
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,635
Intrigue, betrayal, lamps.

74
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,821
It is a ripping yarn,
so buckle your seatbelt.

75
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:52,423
Just tell the story.
Okay.

76
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,508
Here goes.

77
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:57,811
Robin broke a lamp.

78
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,649
Okay, this has to stop.

79
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:04,101
Come on, we're
just having fun.

80
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:06,803
It has been
a long weekend.

81
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,022
This is how I relax.

82
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,357
Really?

83
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,775
<i>This</i> is how you relax?

84
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:14,612
By not getting a single shot
past me the entire morning?

85
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:17,281
You suck, Scherbatsky,
you shoot like my grandma.

86
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,750
Okay, Scherbatsky,
you just poked the dragon.

87
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,168
Here comes the bride.

88
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,986
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
okay. How about

89
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:26,874
we switch to an activity that's
more suited to somebody who's,

90
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:29,543
you know, ,
getting married today?

91
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,563
Oh. We gonna go
chug some Labatts?

92
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:36,450
I was thinking we could chug
some memories instead.

93
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:39,286
"Barney & Robin:
Lovers Forever

94
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:40,521
"and Ever
and Ever:

95
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,556
A Love Story."

96
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:44,892
Sounds cheesy. I'm gonna go barf
forever and ever and ever.

97
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,443
See you, hosers.

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,114
It's not cheesy.

99
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:54,818
See?

100
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,698
Uh, can you tell me
the name of the guest

101
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,249
staying in room nine?

102
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,751
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,003
That would violate
hotel privacy policy.

104
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:18,309
Well, maybe my old friend
Mr. Lincoln...

105
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,345
can emancipate that information.

106
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:25,766
I'm so sorry, I wasn't clear.

107
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:29,553
I <i>can't</i> violate
our hotel privacy policy.

108
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,356
For five dollars.

109
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,879
Something with
a two on it is fine.

110
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,081
But those are super rare and
the one I have is kind of lucky.

111
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,616
Just give me a 20, Mr. Mosby.

112
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:53,477
That room belongs
to a Ms. Susan Tupp.

113
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,796
Oh, boy.

114
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,435
God, you're gorgeous.

115
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:05,272
Oh, I can't wait
to be inside you.

116
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:08,592
Barney. Get out here,
this is your wedding day.

117
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:11,061
Wha...

118
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:12,696
Where is she?
Who?

119
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,482
Look, I just grossly overpaid
for some information

120
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:17,151
about this room,
so I know it's accurate.

121
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:19,787
This room belongs
to Susan Tupp.

122
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,038
Who?

123
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,539
Susan Tupp.

124
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,607
Who?

125
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,243
Sue...

126
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,661
Tupp.

127
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:28,729
Suit up.

128
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm <i>trying</i> to.

129
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:32,049
I need you to help me

130
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,418
pick the suit I'm gonna wear
when I walk down the aisle.

131
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,619
Okay,

132
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,722
Robin walks down the aisle,
you wait at the end of it.

133
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:41,959
Okay, then the suit
I'll be wearing

134
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:45,329
when they all stand as I enter the chapel.
That's also her.

135
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:47,731
Really? Man, the fellas
sure do get boned

136
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,850
on the whole wedding thing, don't they?
Okay.

137
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:51,985
All right, well, let's,
let's pick you a suit.

138
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:53,270
What are... what are
the top contenders?

139
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:56,190
Well, after careful
consideration,

140
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,475
I have narrowed it down to

141
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,577
these ones...

142
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:01,912
and these ones...

143
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:03,831
and the other ones in this room

144
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,166
and all the ones
in the adjoining room.

145
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:07,707
So you've narrowed it down
to all your suits.

146
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:08,870
Yeah, we're screwed.

147
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,987
And this is a picture
of the restaurant

148
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:14,091
where you and Barney
had your first date.

149
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,593
And now you're getting married.

150
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:20,330
Mm.
And this is the receipt

151
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:22,165
from the meal you and Barney ate

152
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,802
at that restaurant
on your first date.

153
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:27,638
And now you're getting married.

154
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,039
Can we look at this later?

155
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,592
Later? There is no later.

156
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:32,843
Robin,

157
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:35,229
this is a day
you only get to do once.

158
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:38,449
You need to appreciate
the importance of it right now.

159
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,951
Oh, my God.

160
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:45,456
How did I only
just now realize this?

161
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,208
Dude, this hotel has
<i>The Wedding Bride 2</i>

162
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,309
on pay-per-view.

163
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,028
Score.

164
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,213
This is the best
day of my life!

165
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,392
I mean, I know Robin's
not the girliest girl,

166
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:01,359
but you'd think
on her wedding day,

167
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,695
she'd be at least
a little sentimental.

168
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:05,447
Everyone deals with getting
married differently.

169
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,649
I got what I thought was
the worst haircut ever.

170
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:10,335
Till I fixed it with the
actual worst haircut ever.

171
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:12,537
Which led to the worst
wedding photos ever.

172
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,957
But at least you had
a wedding day freak-out.

173
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,409
Baby, don't worry.
Any minute now,

174
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:19,577
Robin's gonna get smacked
in the face with her own

175
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:21,713
"holy crap, this
is my wedding" moment,

176
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:24,466
and then she's gonna wedding out
all over the place. I promise.

177
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:26,751
But you can't force it,
it has to just happen.

178
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,971
Mm, I don't know. I mean,
she bailed on my scrapbook

179
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:31,973
when she found out
<i>The Wedding Bride 2</i>

180
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:32,987
is on pay-per-view.

181
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,601
<i>The Wedding Bride 2</i>
is on pay-per-view?!

182
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,762
<i>I'm sorry, did...</i>

183
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,264
did I hear you guys
talking about

184
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,465
<i>The Wedding Bride?</i>

185
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,850
Oh, God.
The movie or the...

186
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,668
smash Broadway musical?

187
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,405
Smash? Oh, oh, oh,
I-I guess a show's a smash now

188
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:49,774
if it closes
after only 96 weeks.

189
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:52,911
So my husband's
ex-fiancé's husband

190
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,863
wrote the screenplay
for <i>The Wedding Bride.</i>

191
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:58,450
"Jed Mosley"
was based on Ted.

192
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:01,186
Okay, Jed was not based on me...

193
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:02,270
Hey!

194
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,089
That is not a toy,
you ragamuffin.

195
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:08,910
That is an authentic flail
I won at the Renaissance fair.

196
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:10,111
...entirely.

197
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:13,715
But, regardless, there's...

198
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,500
there's still some
lingering pain there and...

199
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:16,935
Well, as you can imagine,

200
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:19,003
my friends promised me
that they'd never watch it.

201
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:20,772
Wow.

202
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:22,507
Those are some good friends.

203
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,793
Oh, they're the best.

204
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:28,029
Oh, oh, whoa!

205
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,814
My wiener!

206
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,784
I can't believe Jed made us
promise not to watch this.

207
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:34,018
Wait, you mean Ted.

208
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,804
Whatever. Same guy.

209
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:40,041
See, I would have expected you
to have an extra-special suit

210
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:41,409
tailor-made
just for this occasion.

211
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:42,794
Oh, I did.

212
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:45,463
I had my boy Timmy G make
the perfect wedding suit.

213
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:46,748
You ever heard of "bespoke"?

214
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,533
This suit was
be-freaking-screamed.

215
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:51,035
But then I tried it on this
morning and it was uncomfortable

216
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,538
and itchy and completely wrong.
It was like a suit made

217
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,340
for someone
with terrible posture,

218
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:58,209
no taste and limited funds.

219
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,644
Here, you take it.

220
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:01,146
The only
question is,

221
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,114
which of these
other suits do I pick?

222
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,016
There are so many great
ones to choose from.

223
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:06,184
Uh,

224
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:07,218
how about this one?

225
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,687
Yes. Yes, that's the one.

226
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:12,607
Oh, hey, quick question: is it
weird to get married in a suit

227
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,393
that you may have worn while
banging a female rodeo clown?

228
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,530
I know what you're wondering.

229
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:20,765
Yes, the carpet
matched the drapes.

230
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:23,034
Of course that's weird.
Every part of that is weird.

231
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,068
Mm.

232
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,420
Uh, what about this suit?

233
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:27,505
Huh?

234
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:30,191
Let's just say I stuffed
a lot of bunnies in that suit.

235
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:31,993
Ugh, Barney, do you have
to phrase it that way?

236
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:35,213
Actual bunnies, Ted.
This is my magic suit.

237
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,881
Get your mind out
of the gutter.

238
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:40,385
Though, I did once wear it
to the Playboy holiday party

239
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,587
and, uh...

240
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,690
Let's just say I stuffed a lot
of Bunnies in that suit.

241
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:48,926
Uh...

242
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,361
How about this one?
Oh, man,

243
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,981
I went crazy on an escort
in that one.

244
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,189
Barney, come on.

245
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:56,833
A <i>Ford</i> Escort, Ted,
I did it on a car.

246
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,537
With a woman who I then
may or may not have paid.

247
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,039
Yeah, that one's out, too.

248
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:05,393
Okay, so your wedding's
in a few hours.

249
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,328
Kind of strange
to spend those hours

250
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,047
watching a terrible movie,
right?

251
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,000
Terrible? Lily,
this movie is a revelation.

252
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,951
I can't believe that Ted
wouldn't let us see it.

253
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:16,754
Yeah. Why was he hanging
so much beef on this movie?

254
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:19,057
Just 'cause there's a character
based on him?

255
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,060
Of course. I'll make
all weddings illegal.

256
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,062
Then Stella can never
be a wedding bride.

257
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:26,531
Ooh,

258
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:29,150
No-can-I-do's-ville, baby doll.

259
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:31,469
It's like,
"Relax, Ted,

260
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:34,272
it's no big deal.
You should be flattered."

261
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,357
And now to celebrate with
that piece of chocolate cake

262
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,825
I've been saving.

263
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:38,960
What?!

264
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:40,478
Who ate my cake?!

265
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:44,649
Uh, what cake?

266
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:47,118
Narshall!

267
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,471
Narshall?

268
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,491
Narshall. How dare they?

269
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:54,325
That is
insulting

270
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,677
and ridiculous

271
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,262
and I am nothing
like that character.

272
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,163
I'm gonna sue everyone involved
with this film.

273
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:02,634
So, you're-you're gonna sue
them on the grounds that

274
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:05,570
nothing like that cake thing
has ever happened?

275
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:13,978
If Ted didn't want me
to eat that cake,

276
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,597
he should have put a note on it.

277
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,155
Oh, hi, Grandma.
Robin, sweetheart.

278
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,957
I wanted you
to have this.

279
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,210
It's me and your grandpa
on our wedding day.

280
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:30,712
Aw, that's so sweet.

281
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:31,929
See my bouquet?

282
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,881
Those wildflowers--

283
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:36,250
they were supposed
to be hydrangeas,

284
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:38,336
but there was a mix-up
at the florist's.

285
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:40,388
I was so upset.

286
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,924
Your grandpa went
behind the church

287
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:45,176
and picked
those wildflowers

288
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:46,978
for me. And now

289
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,980
he's buried...
Behind the very same church,

290
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:50,915
surrounded
by the very same wildflowers.

291
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,217
Okay, Grandma,
watching a movie. Got to go.

292
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,236
Every single holiday,

293
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:56,554
that same dumb story.

294
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:59,440
Sorry, Grandma, not as touching
as you think it is.

295
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,659
At the very same church.

296
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,060
Now, I want to see

297
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:06,931
if Jed can get his wiener
unstuck from that thermos.

298
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:09,617
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

299
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:11,285
Uh, I'm sorry.
Did you just

300
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:13,516
turn off the bride's TV
on her wedding day?

301
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:13,956
Oh!

302
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:16,073
Oh! Is this your wedding day?

303
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:18,042
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell
because you're acting

304
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:21,596
like it's any other
Sunday morning, and it's not.

305
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:23,848
Lily, if you're waiting for me
to suddenly turn

306
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,134
into th-th-the Wedding Bride,
you just give up.

307
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,852
That's just not me.
Fine.

308
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:31,105
Maybe we should all just act
like this wedding's no big deal.

309
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:34,859
Maybe I don't even feel like
wearing my bridesmaid's dress.

310
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:37,545
Great. It-It's just a wedding.
Who cares what people wear?

311
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:38,730
Say yes to the suit!

312
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:41,616
I can't! I can't.

313
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:44,369
Great. Because I actually
brought a different dress

314
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:45,703
that I'd like to wear.

315
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:46,571
Fine.

316
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:47,905
Oh, no.

317
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:50,491
Maybe I'll go put it on
right now.

318
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:51,993
Go right ahead.
What?

319
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,094
I'm so sorry.

320
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,111
What, why?

321
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:56,581
I know this story, too.

322
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,268
Really?

323
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,118
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Robin and Lily get
in a big fight

324
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,837
and then, a few minutes later,
there's a knock at the door.

325
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,507
Hello.

326
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:12,936
I've told you
this one before.

327
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,370
A few times.

328
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,354
I'm just...

329
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:19,874
a boring old man
who won't stop spinning yarns.

330
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:22,894
Oh, hey. I love your yarns.

331
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,780
I hope you never stop
spinning them.

332
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,850
But...

333
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:31,769
You're the love of my life,
Pooh Bear.

334
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,955
I just worry about you.

335
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:39,860
I don't want you to be the guy
who lives in his stories.

336
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,664
Life only moves forward.

337
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:48,302
So what happens next?

338
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:50,521
With Lily and the wedding dress,
I mean.

339
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:53,474
Well... she brought the dress

340
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:56,060
so that she and Marshall could
get new wedding photos taken.

341
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:59,614
Because in yet <i>another</i> story
that I know...

342
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:02,216
No!

343
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,153
What kind of space would I have
in my brain for other things

344
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:06,988
if I didn't know all this?

345
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,741
Eh, probably just state birds

346
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:10,942
or some crap.

347
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,894
So, uh,

348
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:15,446
Lily wanted to borrow
Robin's photographer.

349
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:18,399
That shouldn't be a problem.
Shouldn't be

350
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:21,085
a problem, Robin? Of course
it should be a problem.

351
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,503
This is your wedding.

352
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:25,273
You can't let somebody borrow
your photographer.

353
00:14:25,275 --> 00:14:26,758
Don't worry.
She's not serious, Robin.

354
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,260
I didn't even bring the suit
that I wore to our wedding.

355
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:30,411
Yes, you did.

356
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,262
It's in our room.

357
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:32,464
Go put it on.
We're doing this.

358
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:35,183
And, Robin,
since you don't seem to care,

359
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:37,852
I think I'll be wearing this
to the ceremony.

360
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:39,137
Fine!
Fine!

361
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,773
Fine. There's a very simple
solution here.

362
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,724
We might as well just face it.

363
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:48,429
U.S. Marines have to get married
in uniform, so...

364
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:50,198
I'll just go enlist.

365
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,099
Dude,

366
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,051
we can enlist together!
That's the dream!

367
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:54,587
That's not the...

368
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:56,636
I wonder if they let you
pick bunkmates. I hope they do.

369
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:59,374
Although I might want to request
a single. You'll make friends.

370
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,708
Look, enough of this.

371
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,461
Tim made you this amazing suit.

372
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,745
Put it on.

373
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,051
This feels weird.

374
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,369
That's because it's new.

375
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,137
It's a suit that's never
been worn before,

376
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,423
a suit you never dreamed
you'd wear.

377
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:18,943
All of this suit's memories
are still ahead of it.

378
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,611
Look,
picture it, huh?

379
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,647
The ceremony.

380
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,933
When everyone stands up for me?
They do that for her.

381
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,402
They should.

382
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,138
She's gonna
look amazing.

383
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,506
You'd better
believe it.

384
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:34,325
She walks
down the aisle,

385
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,310
you say your vows,

386
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,812
you go
to the reception,

387
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,814
you have
your first dance.

388
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,835
And before you know it,
just like magic,

389
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:46,204
you realize...

390
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,256
it's a perfect fit.

391
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,326
You're right, Ted.

392
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,495
This is the one.

393
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,381
Thanks.

394
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,452
So...

395
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:04,055
belts.

396
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:09,093
Hey, Lil. Nice dress.

397
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:11,028
You two were made
for each other.

398
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,681
Like, does no one care
that I'm wearing this dress?

399
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,149
I care.

400
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,951
Okay. Now you're good.

401
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,569
Okay, look,

402
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:21,656
I know this is your
wedding, but this is

403
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:23,541
a big moment
for all of us.

404
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:26,043
This may be the last time
we're all hanging out together

405
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,062
for who knows how long.

406
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:29,080
I mean, tomorrow
morning,

407
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:30,381
Ted's leaving
for Chicag...

408
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:33,885
Oh, boy.
Lily.

409
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:36,254
Wait, you already know.

410
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:38,523
You already know.

411
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,341
You're married to
Lily, which means...

412
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:42,159
She pocket-texted me
while you were telling her.

413
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,178
So...

414
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,047
everybody knows I'm moving
to Chicago tomorrow.

415
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,734
Lily's right.

416
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:52,954
We don't know the next time
that we'll all be together.

417
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:55,273
<i>And then I think</i>
<i>it hit all of us.</i>

418
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,325
<i>We didn't know the next time</i>
<i>we'd be together.</i>

419
00:16:57,327 --> 00:17:01,045
<i>This was it.</i>

420
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:02,163
And it's funny.

421
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:03,247
In a moment like that,

422
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:04,231
when what's really happening

423
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,083
is too intense to deal with,

424
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,202
sometimes it's best...

425
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:12,740
To leave it unspoken

426
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:16,127
and just enjoy
each other's company instead.

427
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,131
You know, I've been wanting
to see this movie.

428
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,516
Yes, movie time.

429
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,968
So it's not bad luck for the...

430
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,543
bride to see the groom
in his wedding suit?

431
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:27,022
No,

432
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:28,839
I think it's fine. Nice tie.

433
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,726
Thanks. There was a cornflower
blue one I almost went with.

434
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:32,977
Oh. Um,

435
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,812
that would've brought out
your eyes.

436
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:38,265
You brought more than one tie,
right?

437
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,334
I was trying to pack light.

438
00:17:40,336 --> 00:17:42,570
Hey, you know what, maybe the, uh,
groomsmen should go get some food.

439
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,405
I don't want Ted to have
to sit through this movie.

440
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,240
Ah. I appreciate that, Narshall.

441
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:47,224
Really?

442
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:50,044
Aw, damn it.
Sorry, I saw it on a plane.

443
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:51,542
What, so this is gonna be,
like, a thing now?

444
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:51,997
Yeah,

445
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,949
it's gonna be a thing now,
Narshall. Right?

446
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,550
Narshall.
 Dude,

447
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:58,169
settle down, Swarley.

448
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,503
Yeah.

449
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:01,872
Yeah, Swarlize Theron,
take it easy.

450
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:05,459
Man, this was supposed
to be my special day.

451
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,482
Oh. Hey, we survived the storm!

452
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:15,569
Oh, Narshall,
did you do that?

453
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,571
Nope. Wasn't me.

454
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:19,824
Well, then who was it?

455
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:25,446
A gorilla! Gorilla!

456
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:26,614
So that

457
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:28,148
really happened to Ted?

458
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,334
That is exactly
what went down.

459
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,019
Chapter and verse.

460
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,788
Uh-oh. Out of ice.

461
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,490
I'll get it.
Oh, no. Got it. Sit down.

462
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,158
Plus, the, uh, vending machine's
got a loose coil.

463
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,627
I'm gonna try
to hip check my way

464
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,212
into some free
Tropical Skittles.

465
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,284
Your sister's not
like most brides, is she?

466
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:50,504
She's a Scherbatsky.
She's not gonna lose her Timbits

467
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,289
just 'cause she's getting
married.

468
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,394
I guess some people
just never have that

469
00:18:56,396 --> 00:19:00,331
"holy crap,
this is my wedding" moment.

470
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:09,640
Mom?

471
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,200
<i>That's the story.</i>

472
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,386
Right down
to the surprise ending.

473
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:24,371
Is that really such a surprise?

474
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,890
I mean, come on.

475
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,374
Yeah, of course she showed up.

476
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:30,544
What mother is gonna miss
her daughter's wedding?

477
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:38,218
Oh, hey.

478
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,605
No. Come on.

479
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,858
It's okay. I'm fine.

480
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,210
I'm okay.

481
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:53,400
Did Barney really wear
a scuba suit into the bar?

482
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,286
I've told you that story
a million times.

483
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:57,171
Yeah, but where did Barney get
the scuba suit?

484
00:19:57,173 --> 00:20:00,074
He stole it.

485
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:00,941
What?

486
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:02,293
Yeah.

487
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:03,677
I can't believe
I forgot that.

488
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,880
He... walked right
into a sporting goods store,

489
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:08,783
tried on a scuba suit,
and walked right out the door.

490
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:11,352
Walked all the way home
in it, like, 20 blocks.

491
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:13,854
Guy in a scuba suit,

492
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,273
just walking down Broadway.
Ah.

493
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:17,858
He should be in prison.

494
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,644
Well, yeah, for lots of reasons.

495
00:20:20,646 --> 00:20:22,446
You know, the thief
of the group is Lily.

496
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:24,315
Yes. Oh, my God. Lily...
No. She stole my heart.

497
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:25,451
No, n-no, I'm telling you,
Lily, from like, uh...
