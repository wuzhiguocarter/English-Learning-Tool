00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:03,337
NARRATOR: <i>Marshall and Marvin</i>
<i>were taking the bus</i>

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:06,039
<i>on their way to Long Island</i>
<i>to meet up with us.</i>

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:07,424
(crying) There, there,
little Marvin.

4
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:09,126
Let no more
tears fall.

5
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:12,679
We're gonna see Mommy
in no time at all.

6
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:14,882
Hello there. I'm sorry
for all of the noise.

7
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,267
It's been a long day
for the Eriksen boys.

8
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,353
Uh... what's with the rhyming?

9
00:00:19,355 --> 00:00:20,554
I'm glad that you ask.

10
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:23,506
To get my son
sleeping is no easy task.

11
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:26,059
<i>A few weeks ago,</i>
<i>the job fell to my wife.</i>

12
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:28,529
<i>And as the poor baby cried out</i>
<i>for dear life,</i>

13
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:31,698
<i>she read every book,</i>
<i>but all were no use</i>

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,035
<i>until she arrived</i>
<i>at a mother named Goose.</i>

15
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:36,987
Why, Marvin...
MARSHALL: <i>She noted.</i>

16
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,822
...these rhymes
make you tired!

17
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:40,857
And ever since then,
all young Marvin's required

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,360
is one book of rhymes,
and to dream land he goes.

19
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:44,828
Now, what shall we read?

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,414
Oh, crap, I left
his book in the car!

21
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,199
(crying)

22
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,467
That blows.

23
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,386
(crying stops)

24
00:00:52,573 --> 00:00:56,573
<font color=#00FF00>♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x11♪</font>

26
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:06,817
Oh, no, what a bummer!

27
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,485
What craptastic luck!

28
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:10,771
Without Marvin's rhyme book,
this ride's gonna suck!

29
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:12,823
Does anyone here have
some poetry maybe?

30
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:14,107
Or any advice?
Yeah!

31
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,659
Don't have a baby!

32
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,611
(laughter)

33
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:19,496
I guess if I don't want
young Marvin to wake up,

34
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:22,399
the rhymes will just have
to be ones that I make up.

35
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:25,568
I'll whip up some poetry
in seconds flat!

36
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,375
Oh, I know!

37
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:34,011
This story's called
<i>Mosby at the Bat!</i>

38
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>The outlook wasn't brilliant</i>
<i>for poor Ted's romantic life.</i>

39
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:45,755
<i>He was deep into his thirties,</i>
<i>and yet, still he had no wife.</i>

40
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,590
<i>But then, one day</i>
<i>whilst grading papers,</i>

41
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,142
<i>life sent him a whammy.</i>

42
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:51,111
<i>A physics prof named Lisa</i>

43
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,529
<i>who'd just moved here</i>
<i>from Miami.</i>

44
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,530
Professor?

45
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,432
<i>She asked timidly.</i>
<i>He answered:</i>

46
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:56,950
Call me Ted.
Oh.

47
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:58,268
I don't want to bother you.

48
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,870
Please, have a seat.
<i>He said.</i>

49
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:03,290
I'm fairly new to teaching,
and I'm looking for advice.

50
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:06,576
Every night I practice giving
lectures, sometimes twice.

51
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:07,744
But when I teach

52
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:10,914
magnetic force,
I just see eyeballs glazing.

53
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:16,420
I asked around, and people say
your lectures are amazing.

54
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:17,754
Which is really
saying something,

55
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:19,956
because, architecture? Yawn.

56
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,642
<i>And Ted thought...</i>

57
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:23,960
TED: <i>Psh, yeah, 'cause physics</i>
<i>is so interesting.</i>

58
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:25,479
Go on.

59
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:27,130
It's just
that you're so skilled,

60
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:29,016
and I'm a relative beginner.

61
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:32,802
If it isn't too much trouble,
can I take you out to dinner?

62
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:36,523
I'd love to get some pointers,
and I shouldn't keep you late.

63
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:37,974
What do you say?

64
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,526
What do I say?

65
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:41,161
Teddy Westside's
got a date!

66
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:43,313
ALL: Hooray!
MARSHALL: <i>We cheered.</i>

67
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:44,331
Ted's off the bench!

68
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,699
Our boy's back in the game!

69
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,334
Thank God, it's been
a hundred years

70
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:48,535
since Mosby scored a dame.

71
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:50,420
The last time he saw
boobies was

72
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:51,838
the screen-test
scene in <i>Fame.</i>

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,290
The last girl he dated,

74
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,158
I think "Righty" was her name.

75
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,010
Hold it.
Let's not all go crazy

76
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:58,712
like some wild berzerkers.

77
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:01,381
What if this is just a business
meal between co-workers?

78
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:03,500
MARSHALL: <i>Ted thought back</i>
<i>on past failed dates.</i>

79
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,602
Oh, God, that
could be true.

80
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:08,805
How many times have I come
home to find my balls are blue?

81
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:12,175
It all depends where Ted and
his new fetching young Floridian

82
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:14,844
are standing in relation
to that puzzling meridian

83
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:17,147
called
"The International Date Line."

84
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,515
That's right, new theory.

85
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:20,517
"What's that," you ask?
Nobody did.

86
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,120
I'll now address your query!
The date line

87
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:26,206
is the border betwixt happiness
and sorrow.

88
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,525
On this side,
you go home tonight.

89
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:31,361
On this side, home tomorrow.

90
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:34,831
MARSHALL: <i>And then, as Barney made some</i>
<i>gestures that were rather rude,</i>

91
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,085
<i>Ted left to go meet Lisa,</i>
<i>in a rather puzzled mood.</i>

92
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,803
<i>Was this a date?</i>

93
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,722
<i>He simply couldn't tell</i>
<i>how he was faring.</i>

94
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:42,923
<i>Then Lisa showed up.</i>

95
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:46,426
<i>Ted rejoiced to see</i>
<i>what she was wearing.</i>

96
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:47,928
<i>For girls at business dinners</i>

97
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,046
<i>don't have necklines</i>
<i>that revealing!</i>

98
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:57,354
<i>But then a friendly handshake</i>
<i>gave poor Ted</i>

99
00:03:57,356 --> 00:03:59,222
<i>a sinking feeling.</i>

100
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:04,694
<i>And so, the night wore on.</i>

101
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:07,197
<i>And back and forth,</i>
<i>the globe rotated.</i>

102
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>But still, Ted's curiosity was</i>
<i>never fully sated.</i>

103
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,369
<i>How long could this continue?</i>

104
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,204
<i>He was truly fortune's pawn.</i>

105
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:16,239
<i>Then Lisa saw the TV.</i>

106
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,674
Hey, the Yankees game is on!

107
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,509
Of baseball...
<i>Ted observed...</i>

108
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,295
...you seem to have some
firsthand knowledge.

109
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:24,181
<i>To which the lady shrugged</i>
<i>and said...</i>

110
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,766
I played softball in college.

111
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,420
Now the age-old softball
stereotype's just that,

112
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:31,855
and nothing more.

113
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,557
Yeah!
<i>But as the Yankees got a run,</i>

114
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,642
<i>Ted feared he wouldn't score.</i>

115
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,444
<i>For while the date side</i>
<i>of the line's</i>

116
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:39,613
<i>the one we all might guess</i>
<i>he's in,</i>

117
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:42,449
<i>there'll be no joy in Tedville</i>
<i>if our Lisa is a...</i>

118
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,034
Yes! We win!

119
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,403
<i>Then Lisa took a drink</i>
<i>and said...</i>

120
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:48,405
This may sound kind of random,

121
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:51,241
but there actually is a reason
for my rabid Yankee fandom.

122
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:52,993
I guess I'll just be
honest here,

123
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:55,045
though crazy it may seem.

124
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:59,216
My first week in New York,
I dated someone on the team.

125
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:00,300
Which player?

126
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:01,951
I'm not saying.
Please?

127
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,303
What are you, a reporter?

128
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,671
<i>Ted's mind began to race.</i>

129
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:06,473
<i>The waiter came</i>
<i>to take their order.</i>

130
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:07,790
<i>As Lisa said...</i>

131
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,893
I might like
the spaghetti marinara.

132
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:11,344
<i>Poor Ted just wondered</i>
<i>silently...</i>

133
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:13,780
TED:
<i>Mariano Rivera?</i>

134
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:15,098
MARSHALL:
<i>And as she said...</i>

135
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,133
I read this place has great
chicken Milano.

136
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,352
<i>All Ted could bring himself</i>
<i>to think was:</i>

137
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,438
TED:
<i>Alfonso Soriano?</i>

138
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,039
I want something hearty.

139
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,158
How about blackened miso cod?

140
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,443
TED:
<i>Is it Joe Girardi?</i>

141
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,812
<i>Holy crap, is it A-Rod?!</i>

142
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:30,413
<i>Okay, Ted, calm down.</i>

143
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,115
<i>You've got</i>
<i>to get yourself together.</i>

144
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:33,667
<i>Just smile, be charming,</i>

145
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,036
<i>ooze charisma,</i>
<i>talk about the weather.</i>

146
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:37,320
<i>For this might be a date,</i>

147
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:39,539
<i>which means there might be</i>
<i>hanky-panky.</i>

148
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>So, dude, be cool, relax,</i>
<i>don't even...</i>

149
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,845
Just tell me which Yankee!

150
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,431
I'd rather not
discuss this here.

151
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,183
But then again, I'd hate...

152
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,353
to let a silly secret ruin
such a lovely date.

153
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,721
<i>If there's</i>

154
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:55,939
an elephant in the room,

155
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,140
why don't we just remove it?

156
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:58,475
I dated Derek Jeter.

157
00:05:58,477 --> 00:05:59,842
Here's a picture
that'll prove it.

158
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:02,062
MARSHALL: <i>As Ted looked</i>
<i>at that cell phone pic,</i>

159
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,980
<i>there were two things</i>
<i>he reckoned.</i>

160
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,848
<i>This definitely was a date,</i>

161
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,618
<i>but there wouldn't be a second.</i>

162
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,670
See? It worked.

163
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,873
I said some rhymes,
and out my boy did conk.

164
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,242
Now let's enjoy the ride.

165
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,159
(brakes screech)

166
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:18,078
Move, jackass!
(honk)

167
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,380
(crying)

168
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:24,953
Okay, I need a brand-new tale
to silence Marvin's chatter.

169
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:27,955
I don't know, that last one had
some sketchy subject matter.

170
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:31,025
Forgive me, but before you got
here, did you smoke a joint?

171
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,294
You don't tell kids a tale
that crass!

172
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,812
NARRATOR:
<i>I guess he had a point.</i>

173
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:37,064
I know, I said some things
that were,

174
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,200
as you say,
kind of questionable.

175
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:41,252
The truth is,
children Marvin's age

176
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:43,087
aren't really
that impressionable.

177
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,623
Do you remember anything
from when you were this small?

178
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,726
Pumpkin picking at age three is
the first thing I recall.

179
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:50,094
Hmm.
Huh.

180
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:51,479
He won't remember this.
I guess it's true.

181
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,713
It better be.

182
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:53,898
Or else we'll end up paying

183
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,382
through the nose
for Marvin's therapy.

184
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:58,319
Okay, buddy, nice chat,
but I think I need a break.

185
00:06:58,321 --> 00:06:59,220
Great idea.

186
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:01,272
After this story!

187
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,224
<i>Robin Takes the Cake.</i>

188
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,198
<i>Once in an East Side bakery,</i>

189
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,334
<i>your debonair Aunt Robin was</i>
<i>making other customers think,</i>

190
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:15,286
<i>"Geez, who let this slob in?"</i>

191
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:18,539
<i>She didn't care about their</i>
<i>stares, or who was looking on.</i>

192
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,907
<i>She'd just broke up with...</i>

193
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,092
Kevin.

194
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:23,845
No, Gael. Or Scooby?

195
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,580
Don?

196
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,466
<i>Now, sometimes,</i>

197
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:29,634
<i>when it rains it pours,</i>

198
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:30,885
<i>and sometimes,</i>
<i>it starts snowing,</i>

199
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,420
<i>for as cream filling</i>
<i>hit her shirt...</i>

200
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:34,939
MAN:
Hey, Robin, how's it going?

201
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:36,774
<i>'Twas Simon, her ex-boyfriend</i>

202
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:39,143
<i>from her younger days</i>
<i>in Canada,</i>

203
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:40,928
<i>but now, he looked</i>
<i>quite different...</i>

204
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,397
Um...

205
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,782
Rhyme.

206
00:07:44,784 --> 00:07:47,434
Uh... thinking. Uh...

207
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,770
I've just been handed
a news flash.

208
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,539
The word "Canada"
is unrhymeable.

209
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,940
It's easier to--
I don't know--

210
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:54,876
get drunk and try
to climb a bull.

211
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:57,295
But Canada, damn it,
ask any man on the planet

212
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:58,629
and watch
their stammerin' stamina

213
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:01,499
as they clamor and cram it
into the middle of a sentence

214
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,833
for a shot at repentance,

215
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,253
pass the problem on to all
their non-rhyming descendants.

216
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,638
I've never met anyone who could
clean up after Canada.

217
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,423
Except my Uncle Tony
from the Bronx.

218
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:10,558
He's a janitor.

219
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,760
(applause)

220
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:17,515
Show-off.

221
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:19,317
Simon. Nice to see you.

222
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,402
So, what brings you to New York?

223
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:22,937
I live here now.
What? Really?

224
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,488
Yeah.
That's great.

225
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,940
Can I get a fork?

226
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,358
MARSHALL:
<i>He'd always been a deadbeat</i>

227
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,110
<i>and your classic hoser phony,</i>

228
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:32,029
<i>but seeing Simon all cleaned up</i>
<i>hit Robin like a Zamboni.</i>

229
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:34,282
<i>And as she looked him</i>
<i>up and down,</i>

230
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:35,750
<i>young Robin felt a tingle.</i>

231
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:37,618
<i>Had Simon blossomed finally?</i>

232
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,587
<i>And if so, was he single?</i>

233
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:40,955
So great.

234
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:43,374
<i>She purred, whilst batting</i>
<i>her eyelashes like a flooze.</i>

235
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,659
Yup, I'm engaged
to Louise Marsh,

236
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:47,428
and our pad's got a Jacuzz!

237
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,663
<i>The bakery spinned,</i>
<i>the floor dropped out.</i>

238
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:51,382
<i>The air was thick as syrup.</i>

239
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,467
<i>Poor Robin swooned,</i>
<i>she couldn't breathe,</i>

240
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:55,102
<i>her eyes began to tear up.</i>

241
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:57,171
<i>And as she tried</i>
<i>to stammer some excuse</i>

242
00:08:57,173 --> 00:08:58,973
<i>to get away, Simon said:</i>

243
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:01,225
Our wedding cake is
pretty bitchin', eh?

244
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:04,729
<i>And so was born the worst idea</i>
<i>poor Robin's ever had.</i>

245
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:07,281
<i>And on Ted's door</i>
<i>there came a rapping.</i>

246
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,350
I did something bad.

247
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:10,901
<i>As Robin told her tale,</i>

248
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:13,070
<i>Ted knew</i>
<i>she'd made a massive boo-boo.</i>

249
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:17,375
<i>For stealing someone's wedding</i>
<i>cake is terribly bad juju.</i>

250
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:19,877
Robin, I'm beside myself
to see what you've become!

251
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,829
You must return
this cake at once!

252
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:22,830
I can't!
Why not?

253
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:24,131
'Cause...

254
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,549
Yum.

255
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:29,804
<i>Ted gasped, for he had never</i>
<i>seen a brazen act so vicious.</i>

256
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:31,639
<i>Robin felt remorse, and yet...</i>

257
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,674
Oh, God, this is delicious!

258
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:37,428
<i>So one piece led to two,</i>
<i>then three, then five, then 17.</i>

259
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,548
<i>She savaged that poor cake</i>
<i>like some rapacious wolverine.</i>

260
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,551
<i>Eating, gobbling, munching,</i>
<i>so the frenzied night wore on.</i>

261
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,354
<i>And by the time</i>
<i>your mom arrived,</i>

262
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:48,322
<i>the cake was halfway gone.</i>

263
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,074
I came as soon as I got word.

264
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,909
So how bad is the damage?

265
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:56,113
See for yourself the product
of her cake-in-gullet crammage!

266
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:57,448
Half a cake?

267
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,849
What have I done?!

268
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:00,951
The world shall not forgive it!

269
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:02,703
This day will live in infamy.

270
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:04,905
I never shall outlive it!

271
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,540
For I have become

272
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,577
the girl that eats her feelings,
don't mistake it.

273
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:12,763
I think I need to get out
of this chair before I break it.

274
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:15,516
Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!

275
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,101
<i>Said Mommy, with great fervor.</i>

276
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:19,920
You can't stop now,
for don't you see?

277
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:23,757
To the uninformed observer,
you're not some sad cliché,

278
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,977
some loser
from a chick-lit story.

279
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:30,698
You're Robin, and you're half
a wedding cake away from glory!

280
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,600
If you quit now,
then Simon wins,

281
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:35,602
the tale comes to a stop

282
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:38,072
at how you saw
an ex, freaked out,

283
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:39,790
and robbed a pastry shop.

284
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,410
If you have the guts, my dear,

285
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,628
it's time to get empowered

286
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,797
and be remembered for this

287
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,467
sweet behemoth you devoured.

288
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:50,718
And years from now,

289
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,671
the troubadour will
raise his voice and sing

290
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,474
of the time that Robin
took the cake.

291
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,509
And ate the whole...

292
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,760
damned...

293
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,095
thing.

294
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:03,814
MARSHALL: <i>Once more into the breach</i>
<i>she surged,</i>

295
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,466
<i>as Ted and Mommy cheered</i>

296
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:09,153
<i>and bite by bite the towering</i>
<i>confection disappeared.</i>

297
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,105
<i>Some friends were called</i>
<i>to come and watch.</i>

298
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:12,690
<i>And no one had to beg.</i>

299
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,974
<i>It soon became a party.</i>

300
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,910
<i>Barney even got a keg.</i>

301
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:18,996
<i>Forkful after forkful,</i>
<i>Robin guzzled French vanilla</i>

302
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:21,482
<i>making noises not unlike those</i>
<i>made by a gorilla.</i>

303
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,284
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Come on, Robin, finish it.

304
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:26,003
Yeah.
MARSHALL: <i>Mom's exhortations rang</i>

305
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:29,656
<i>like Apollo coaching Rocky</i>
<i>'gainst a frosted Clubber Lang.</i>

306
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:31,292
Oh, <i>Rocky IV,</i> my favorite.

307
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:32,960
No, no, <i>IV</i> is with the Russians.

308
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:34,828
No, <i>IV's</i> the one
where he talks weird

309
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,347
because of his
concussions.

310
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:37,798
I think that's all of them.
Hey now,

311
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,551
no need to be discordant.
It's <i>Rocky IV.</i>

312
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,269
No, <i>III.</i>
No, <i>II.</i>

313
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,138
It's really
not important.

314
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,025
<i>At last young Robin raised</i>
<i>the final bite up to her lips</i>

315
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,343
<i>the crowd grew still.</i>

316
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,362
<i>The only sound was Barney</i>

317
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:53,147
<i>eating chips.</i>
(crunch)

318
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,484
<i>Just one bite left.</i>

319
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:59,520
Hey, this is like that scene
from <i>Cool Hand Luke.</i> You know,

320
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:01,405
(Southern accent):
"My boy can eat 50 eggs " Right?

321
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,374
She's gonna puke.

322
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:05,543
<i>But Robin did not puke.</i>

323
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:07,795
<i>She ate that bite</i>
<i>and stood up, proud.</i>

324
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:11,048
(wild cheering, whooping)

325
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,467
Wait. I'm not done yet.

326
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:15,219
<i>She shouted,</i>
<i>to the startled crowd.</i>

327
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,138
I've bested
this here wedding cake.

328
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,839
I'll gladly wear that crown.

329
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,007
But now that I have

330
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,393
done that task it's time
to wash it down.

331
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:24,645
For it's been such
an awesome night,

332
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:27,148
there's just one way
to cap it.

333
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,517
I'm going to drink
this entire keg.

334
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,520
Okay, Barney, tap it.

335
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:33,838
Oh!
Wow.

336
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,525
Hup.
Ho-o, oh.

337
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:40,945
MARSHALL: <i>And now that night's remembered</i>
<i>not for Robin getting dumped</i>

338
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:44,365
but as the night we took her
in to get her stomach pumped.

339
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,417
And look at that,

340
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,902
the little angel's
sleeping soundly, Gus.

341
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:50,538
Looks like our problems...

342
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,539
Pick a lane!

343
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,756
(honks horn, Marvin cries)

344
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:56,243
I hate this
stupid bus.

345
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,596
Marvin, I'm afraid
this night is not much of a winner.

346
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:03,463
Stuck in traffic,
now we've missed

347
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:05,398
the whole rehearsal dinner.

348
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,335
I pray that I was right
and that you'll have no memory

349
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:11,488
of this godforsaken ride
down the congested LIE.

350
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,723
At least we know
one thing for sure:

351
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,358
things can't get worse, I swear.

352
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,861
Adios, truck stop
burrito. Ooh!

353
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,579
Do not go in there.

354
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:23,700
Okay, one more story,
and I'll try to tell it pretty.

355
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,702
The tale of Barney Stinson,

356
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,171
<i>Player King of New York City.</i>

357
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:36,213
<i>Once upon a time, we all</i>
<i>went out to get our drink on.</i>

358
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,081
<i>When who should</i>
<i>walk in but a girl</i>

359
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,417
<i>with sweater tight and pink on.</i>

360
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,501
<i>She ordered up a beer.</i>

361
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,303
<i>I think you see where</i>
<i>this is going.</i>

362
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,605
<i>As Barney put it,</i>
<i>oh so eloquently:</i>

363
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,340
Boy-oy-oy-oing.

364
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:51,010
<i>He rose to go approach this</i>
<i>girl commanding such intrigue</i>

365
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,362
<i>when Mommy interrupted:</i>

366
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,447
Dude, she's way
out of your league.

367
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:58,368
She's not in Daisy Dukes,
nor squeezed into a Hooters tee.

368
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,353
And I don't see a
Curves membership

369
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:01,821
dangling from
her key.

370
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:02,855
She has no glaring

371
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:06,359
spray tan, no
unicorn tattoos.

372
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:10,530
She's sipping Chardonnay, not pounding
cherry-flavored booze.

373
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:11,715
Her makeup
isn't running,

374
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,533
she's not playing
with her hair.

375
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:16,703
There's very little chance
she'll let you put it anywhere.

376
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:18,922
Your challenge is accepted, Lil.

377
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,974
There is no girl too pretty,

378
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,709
for I am Barney Stinson,

379
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:25,145
Player King of New York City.

380
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:27,514
You can't anoint
yourself the king,

381
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,482
just like that jerk, LeBron.

382
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:31,685
He left the Cavs
three years ago.

383
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,436
Bro, give it
up, move on.

384
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:34,437
So why

385
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:35,939
am I king?
Glad you asked.

386
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,990
We didn't.
Never do.

387
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,858
It's origin
story time.

388
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,561
And trust me,
every word is true.

389
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:45,064
<i>One morning long ago,</i>
<i>I woke up next to a conquest.</i>

390
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,334
<i>So many great things</i>
<i>'bout this girl: her boobs,</i>

391
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:50,069
<i>her rack, her chest.</i>

392
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:51,621
<i>She had a thirst for action,</i>

393
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:53,790
<i>and young Barney</i>
<i>was a-quenchin' it.</i>

394
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,175
Is this important
to the story?

395
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,960
No, just thought
I'd mention it.

396
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,213
<i>As I departed, having bid</i>
<i>this busty babe buh-bye,</i>

397
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,349
<i>I stopped and looked around,</i>
<i>and wondered:</i>

398
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,683
Where the hell am I?

399
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,186
<i>The sign read 22nd Street,</i>
<i>and my concern decreased</i>

400
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:09,422
<i>until a cold wind</i>
<i>blew a branch aside,</i>

401
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:10,724
<i>revealing: "East."</i>

402
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:13,193
The East Side. No.

403
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,427
Wh-What have I done?

404
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:15,862
<i>I stammered with chagrin.</i>

405
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,614
<i>Just then a black sedan</i>
<i>pulled up...</i>

406
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,316
You Barney?
Yeah.

407
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,867
Get in.
(sighs)

408
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:22,118
Is any of this true?

409
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,238
Of course. Now,
hang on to your "chayers."

410
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,707
For that day
I was called before...

411
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,293
<i>the High Council of Players.</i>

412
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:33,713
Gentlemen, for your attendance
here, our deepest thanks.

413
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:38,001
I'm sad to say, this council
has a poacher in its ranks.

414
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,452
For Barney here

415
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,721
picked up a girl
outside his territory.

416
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:42,722
The East Side

417
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,391
is Tuxedo Charlie's turf.

418
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:45,475
He's mad.

419
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,876
True story.

420
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:50,463
The Agreement of 2004
quite clearly did define

421
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:53,533
Fifth Avenue to be our hunting
grounds' dividing line.

422
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,988
Your West Side college girls are
not the slip I park my boat in.

423
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,306
So you should know

424
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:03,209
my East Side debutantes
are quite verboten.

425
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,362
(sighs) Members
of the council...

426
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,147
Bros... nobody wants a war.

427
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,284
Of course I've not
forgotten the agreement of '04.

428
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:13,086
What can I say? A bonehead move.

429
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:14,771
Defend it?
I'm not able.

430
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,257
But, bros, have I not been a bro

431
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,842
to each bro at this table?

432
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,094
My friend from Brooklyn,
Pickle Jar Bob,

433
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:22,846
will give some validation.

434
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,080
Remember that
young tourist

435
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,666
who was looking
for Penn Station?

436
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:29,386
She'd just come in from Boston,
had a wicked good-in-bed look.

437
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,440
I gave her bad directions
and she ended up in Red Hook.

438
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:35,392
Shut up, Barney.
Whoa, Bronx Donnie,

439
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,110
let's not get excited.

440
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:40,347
Tuxedo Charlie's not the only
one here who's been slighted.

441
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:43,917
You told her you were Jeter
in your quest to lie upon her.

442
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,403
Impersonating Yankees
is my thing.

443
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,071
Have you no honor?

444
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,123
Gentlemen, please,
let's not blow

445
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,075
this détente
to smithereens.

446
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,360
Council recognizes Captain Bill,

447
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:55,829
our bro from Queens.

448
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,029
Thank you.

449
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,214
You all know me,

450
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,899
and you all
respect my game.

451
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,386
I dress up like a pilot
and meet girls in baggage claim.

452
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:06,673
And on my long-ass subway ride
from 61st and Woodside,

453
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:09,759
I came up with a plan to keep you
each other's good side.

454
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,312
Barney,
you have wronged these two.

455
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:13,646
So, for the game

456
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,882
they're losing,
you now must grant them each

457
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:18,401
a West Side hottie
of their choosing.

458
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,469
You're kidding.

459
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,904
That's the settlement?

460
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,839
Come on, that's rather silly.
Gentlemen,

461
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,857
what say you?

462
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,858
I want Robin.

463
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,825
I want Lily.

464
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,861
Please. Bronx Donnie?

465
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:30,196
No chance he could
get me in the sack.

466
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:33,083
Tell that Mafioso I know
something he can whack.

467
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,567
Ladies, don't
you worry,

468
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:36,736
your fair legs can
all stay closed.

469
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:38,037
'Cause luckily
they took

470
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,040
the counteroffer
I proposed.

471
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,342
Well, gentlemen,

472
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,194
it seems there's nothing
I can say to sway you.

473
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,528
Charlie, Donnie,

474
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,380
say no more,
I gladly will repay you.

475
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:49,599
Carlotta, some champagne.

476
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,470
Let's toast before
we all adjourn.

477
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,891
To boobies.

478
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,643
Oh, and B-T-dub,

479
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,395
y'all just drank poison.

480
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:03,530
Ha-burn.

481
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,064
(gags)

482
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:15,575
(maniacal laugh)

483
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:23,082
And thus, my friends,
I have become,

484
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,117
through methods somewhat gory

485
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,837
the Player King
of New York City.

486
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,005
Boom.

487
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,290
The end.

488
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,642
True story.

489
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,144
Well, that was great.

490
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,095
Your little story
tickled all our ribs.

491
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:38,014
But one mistake
you made, sir,

492
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,400
was forgetting
to call dibs.

493
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:41,067
(gasps)

494
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:42,468
BARNEY:
No! Not fair.

495
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,103
But I'm the king.

496
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,990
And such a better dresser.
TED: Sorry, dude,

497
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,408
but that's revenge

498
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,110
for Lisa the professor.
(chuckles)

499
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,195
(giggles)

500
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,613
Let's have
another round.

501
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:54,831
Yes.
MARSHALL: <i>Your mommy said.</i>

502
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,616
<i>And so we had one.</i>

503
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,501
<i>The night wore on,</i>
<i>and I must say,</i>

504
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,453
<i>it wasn't a half bad one.</i>

505
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:02,755
<i>What memories.</i>
<i>Our young and happy hearts</i>

506
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:05,592
<i>were hot as fire.</i>

507
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:08,711
Feels like a lifetime
since those days.

508
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:12,465
(loud bump)
BUS DRIVER: Sorry, folks,

509
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:13,933
flat tire.

510
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:15,435
(Marvin cries)
Oh, come on.

511
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:17,937
Now I'm never gonna
make it to Nantucket.

512
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,006
(Marvin continues wailing)

513
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:25,728
(explosions)

514
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,647
Oh, look a
fireworks display.

515
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,232
Some rockets
red glare action.

516
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,516
Thank God.

517
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:34,120
Thought my glaucoma drops
were causing a reaction.

518
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:38,241
Marvin, I'm so sorry this
whole journey's been a bummer.

519
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:43,329
Soon you'll be right back in
Mommy's arms, as warm as summer.

520
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:46,916
But sadly while your troubles
stop once we get to the inn

521
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:50,303
the moment we arrive
is when my troubles will begin.

522
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,922
Sometimes daddies screw up,

523
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:55,558
sometimes mommies get upset.

524
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,062
I really hope this weekend
is a memory you'll forget.

525
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,565
So look up at those fireworks,
enjoy the falling embers...

526
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:06,185
NARRATOR: <i>And that, kids,</i>
<i>is the very first thing</i>

527
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:09,656
<i>your cousin</i>
<i>Marvin remembers.</i>

528
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,355
Gentlemen and ladies,
it'll be an hour or so...

529
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,440
(groans) before the truck
gets here to give our

530
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,141
broken bus a tow.

531
00:20:19,143 --> 00:20:22,862
So in the meantime I suggest
we all get nice and cozy.

532
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:25,448
We're gonna be here
for a while.

533
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,418
Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?

534
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Yeah!

535
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:34,823
How far do you suppose it is
to the Farhampton Inn?

536
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,792
I'd say about five miles away.

537
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:38,511
Oh, no.

538
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,962
What's with the grin?

539
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:42,164
NARRATOR: <i>Then Marshall</i>
<i>looked up heavenward,</i>

540
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,050
<i>and swore by night's first star</i>

541
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:46,469
<i>five simple words</i>
<i>he'd soon regret:</i>

542
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,937
I can walk that far.
