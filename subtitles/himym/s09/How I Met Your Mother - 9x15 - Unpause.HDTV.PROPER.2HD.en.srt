1
00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:02,444
Okay. It's over.

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:04,746
Starting the clock now.

3
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:08,830
- Labor sucks, huh?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:10,331
That fun-sounding name?

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,966
It's totally misleading.

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,185
Better have this baby soon.

7
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:15,987
You know my
mom's rule:

8
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:18,189
Nothing good happens
after 2:00 a.m.

9
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:19,274
I don't buy it.

10
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:21,810
Just like I don't buy
what her son told me:

11
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:23,411
"Let's go away
for one last weekend

12
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:24,746
"before the baby comes.

13
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:26,364
We'll be fine!"

14
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,283
Well, I hate
to point fingers,

15
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,418
but you should
never listen to me.

16
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,619
You know that.

17
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,004
That's my bad.

18
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:36,073
Oh!

19
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:37,509
- Here comes  another one.
- Already?

20
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:38,676
- Yeah. Yeah yep.
- Okay, okay, okay.

21
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:40,411
We should get you to
the hospital. Come on.

22
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:41,763
Okay.

23
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:42,931
Oh, here we go.

24
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:46,384
Sho-sho-shoes,
baby-baby-baby...

25
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:51,472
You guys can't still see where
Marshall slapped me, can you?

26
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:54,142
Your face looks like
a "don't walk" signal.

27
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:55,527
Your face looks like
a photo negative

28
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:56,811
of the Hamburger Helper box.

29
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:58,646
A palm reader could
tell Marshall's future

30
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:00,281
by studying your face.

31
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:02,600
The phrase "talk to the hand
'cause the face ain't listening"

32
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:03,701
doesn't work for you

33
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:05,653
because the hand
is on your face.

34
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,373
A simple "yes"
would've sufficed.

35
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,458
Oh, baby,

36
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,109
I missed you so much.

37
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,661
I am so angry!

38
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:16,447
I am gonna tear you
apart tonight.

39
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:17,665
I am gonna
tear you

40
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,167
- apart tonight!
- Okay, okay.

41
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,785
Look, we said
that we wouldn't fight

42
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:23,438
until the gang was all done
hanging out, remember?

43
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,623
<i>Ever since Lily</i>
<i>heard that Marshall</i>

44
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,291
<i>had accepted an offer</i>
<i>to be a judge,</i>

45
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:29,761
<i>thus jeopardizing</i>
<i>their planned year in Italy,</i>

46
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:31,613
<i>they both knew</i>
<i>a big fight was coming.</i>

47
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:33,948
<i>But when they finally</i>
<i>saw each other...</i>

48
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,800
Pause?

49
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:37,235
Pause.

50
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:39,520
<i>See, Lily and Marshall</i>
<i>had a long tradition</i>

51
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:41,573
<i>of hitting "pause"</i>
<i>on their arguments.</i>

52
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:43,474
<i>Sometimes they paused because</i>

53
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:45,610
<i>they suddenly had</i>
<i>other things to do.</i>

54
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:47,795
We have to stick
to our budget! Okay?

55
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:49,781
You cannot be out there
buying all these

56
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:51,532
Brazilian bikini waxes

57
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:53,317
and Kama Sutra body oils

58
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,969
and edible...
Pause.

59
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:58,339
<i>Sometimes, they paused</i>
<i>to keep their fights</i>

60
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:59,958
<i>from subtly changing subjects.</i>

61
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,492
Baby, I cannot
put up with

62
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,628
your shoes being
all over the house!

63
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,680
Why not? I put up with
your terrible mother.

64
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,132
- Pause!
- Pause.

65
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:09,634
<i>And now that they were paused,</i>

66
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,519
<i>Marshall realized</i>
<i>he would do anything</i>

67
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,805
<i>to stay paused</i>
<i>for as long as he could.</i>

68
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,506
Okay, time
to go to bed.

69
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:16,641
Big day tomorrow.

70
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:17,609
- Big day tomorrow!
- Big day tomorrow!

71
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,693
Screw tomorrow!

72
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:19,894
We go big tonight, huh?

73
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:22,697
- We go big tonight!
- We go big tonight!

74
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,282
I mean, uh...

75
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:25,533
come on, you know, uh,

76
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,785
what time
is it, anyway?

77
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,239

79
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,370
Hey, where's
the baby?

80
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:49,674
- The elevator!
- The elevator!

81
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,376
Ah, that joke just
never gets old.

82
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:54,712
And it's not at all inspired
by real-life events.

83
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:56,497
- No, it is not.
- Mm-mm.

84
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,716
Anyway, the sitter has
Marvin for the night.

85
00:02:58,718 --> 00:02:59,851
Ooh!

86
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,020
And now...
the best thing

87
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,705
to come out of my
cross-country trip:

88
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:05,523
a little segment I like to call

89
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:09,327
"Embarrassing Souvenirs I Picked
Up From Ted's Childhood Home."

90
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:14,983
"Totally
Awesome Ted."

91
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,001
What, did you steal this off
some other kid named Ted?

92
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:18,369
I'm just getting
warmed up here.

93
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,837
This is fun.

94
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,739
We're all...
you know, it's...

95
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,074
I'm having fun.

96
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:25,677
When you squeeze this toy,
a recording of Ted says,

97
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,929
"I wuv you, Mommy!"

98
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,047
Oh, but that's sweet!

99
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,932
Why would we make
fun of him for that?

100
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,750
He gave it to her
when he was 19.

101
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:34,202
I wuv you, Mommy.

102
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:39,757
And lastly, a photo
of young Ted

103
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,727
and his best friend
dressed up like cowboys.

104
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:43,728
No, oh, all right.

105
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,046
Leave him alone.

106
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:46,531
His best friend
was a balloon.

107
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,532
I want to see that picture

108
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:48,774
more than I want
to get married!

109
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:52,537
I hate you so much.

110
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:56,374
Oo yah maya stupa koon!

111
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:58,409
Ho ho ho!

112
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,977
<i>Over the years, we'd seen</i>

113
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,296
<i>all sorts of levels</i>
<i>of Barney's drunkenness.</i>

114
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:03,614
How you doin'?

115
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:04,916
<i>"Richard Dawson drunk..."</i>

116
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:06,718
Ah, is this your sister?

117
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,637
<i>"Big plans with strangers</i>
<i>drunk..."</i>

118
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,638
Hey!

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
Me and the Road Dawgs

120
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:14,959
going splitsies on a time share
in Flint, Michigan!

121
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,961
And...

122
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:19,130
non-refundably booked!

123
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,733
Come on! I'm gonna buy
you all some mopeds!

124
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:22,850
Road Dawgs!

125
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:25,153
<i>And "Marcel Marceau drunk..."</i>

126
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,240
<i>But we knew the night was over</i>
<i>whenever Barney got...</i>

127
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:30,274
<i>"Jabba drunk."</i>

128
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:32,360
<i>So drunk that his speech</i>

129
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:34,162
<i>bore an uncanny</i>
<i>resemblance to that of...</i>

130
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:37,448
<i>Jabba the Hutt from</i>
Return of the Jedi.

131
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,616
Bo shuda!

132
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:39,650
Ha ha ha!

133
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:41,619
Okay, we have to go to bed.

134
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,570
Big day tomorrow.

135
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:43,704
- Big day tomorrow!
- Noon-eeg Han Solo!

136
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:44,822
Screw tomorrow!

137
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,657
Let's go big tonight!

138
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,676
- We go big tonight!
- Ah wotto potto tapa ho!

139
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:50,995
No, Marshall, let's go now.

140
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:52,780
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

141
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,348
Look, I-I guess we
have to do this.

142
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,618
Okay, first off, I know how
important Italy was to you...

143
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,687
Shut up and do me!

144
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,808
Okay, we have
to go to bed.

145
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,976
Yeah.

146
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:07,879
Yeah.
I need to get

147
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:09,947
my ear hair trimmed
in the morning.

148
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,949
It's like a rain forest
in there.

149
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:14,685
Uh, why would you volunteer
that information?

150
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:15,987
Because it's the truth.

151
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:19,657
Also, I peed a little
on my tie at the urinal.

152
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,859
Uh, Barney...

153
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:23,527
who's taller: me or you?

154
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,797
You're taller.
I wear lifts in all my shoes.

155
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,165
Oh, my God, Robin...

156
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,484
Barney has reached
a whole new level.

157
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:31,669
He's "truth serum drunk."

158
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,187
He can't lie.

159
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,006
So we can finally
get the answers

160
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:36,674
we've always
been wondering about.

161
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:38,059
Look, I know you said
you had to go to bed,

162
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:39,093
but I really think...

163
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:40,561
Screw tomorrow!

164
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,696
We go big tonight.

165
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:43,347
Yeah.

166
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,666
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

167
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,718
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

168
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,686
We're not unpaused?

169
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:49,770
Not yet.

170
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:51,105
Mama needs some Papa.

171
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:52,523
But as soon as we're
done having sex,

172
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:53,557
we are having that fight!

173
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,326
Wait, so we're...

174
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:57,561
not gonna fight

175
00:05:57,563 --> 00:06:00,531
until after we're
done having sex.

176
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,733
Challenge accepted.

177
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:05,294
Um, so... just,
just to be clear,

178
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,173
after we finish
having sex,

179
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,758
that's when we'll
have our fight?

180
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,776
That's right.

181
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,945
Excuse me.

182
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:20,319
Okay, Marshall.

183
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,654
It's go time.

184
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,656
You've had great nights
of sex before,

185
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,291
most of them with Lily,

186
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,993
a few by yourself...

187
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,745
and we'll always have that

188
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,047
Unscrambled Spice Channel
Glitch of '93...

189
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:33,750
but this has got to be
the performance of a lifetime.

190
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:35,585
Jimi Hendrix at Monterey.

191
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:37,804
James Brown at the Apollo.

192
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,922
Your law school funk band
pretty much anywhere.

193
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:41,758
So get out there

194
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,178
and bang your wife for
as long as you possibly can!

195
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:48,949
Not a good sign that
I'm already out of breath.

196
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,905
So... Barney will answer

197
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:58,925
any question we ask him
with the truth?

198
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:00,209
I think so.

199
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,278
Honey...

200
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,865
when that Bryan Adams song
came on the radio,

201
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:08,000
did two mosquitoes
really fly into your eyes

202
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,035
at the same time?

203
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,586
No.

204
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:12,705
I got all choked up
thinking about how

205
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:15,825
everything he does,
he does it for her.

206
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,293
Checks out.

207
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,427
Okay, what next?

208
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:19,745
I mean, it's...

209
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,080
it's so hard to know
where to begin.

210
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:22,081
I mean, there are so many...

211
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,582
What did you do to my mom?!

212
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,135
<i>Well, that night,</i>

213
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,970
<i>we were in my car...</i>

214
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:29,372
I was wrong!
I can't handle this!

215
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:31,374
Uh, just tell me
in baseball terms.

216
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,592
I got thrown out
trying to stretch

217
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:34,927
a single into a double.

218
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:39,866
I can live with that.

219
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,102
How about that time
you walked into the bar

220
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:45,021
wearing "Triple-X-Ray Goggles"?

221
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,441
Well, hello,
you two lovely ladies.

222
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,626
What are you wearing?

223
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:51,828
Oh, hey, Robin,
didn't see you there.

224
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,947
Just Triple-X-Ray Goggles,
no big deal. Oh...

225
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,166
There is no way
those things work.

226
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,885
I'm not even here.

227
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:00,753
Just act natural.

228
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,341
Right.

229
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,810
'Cause that jacket's
made of lead.

230
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,146
Those things
didn't work, did they?

231
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,682
Absolutely. Lily's boobs
always work for me.

232
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:14,267
Oh, the goggles?
No.

233
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,686
Next question.

234
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:19,906
You keep saying "ring bear"

235
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:22,474
instead of ring bear-er.

236
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:25,778
Will there or will there not

237
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,830
be a bear at our wedding?

238
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:30,366
The truth is...

239
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,151
aggle flaggle klabble.

240
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:33,970
Wumby flappy snurp...

241
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,571
Oh, my God, he's dipped back
down to Jabba drunk!

242
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,655
Give him another drink!

243
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,507
Come on.

244
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,659
Oh, yeah, baby.

245
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,511
I could go all night.

246
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,881
<i>I can't hold out much longer!</i>

247
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:47,233
<i>What are the least arousing</i>
<i>things I can think of?</i>

248
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,669
 Day-old roadkill

249
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,105
 Ah, yeah...

250
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:54,607
 Fingernail

251
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:59,195
 Fingernail clippings

252
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:01,781
 That is some dull stuff

253
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:06,235
 How your TMJ night guard
smells in the morning

254
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,537
 Nasty

255
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,573
 Bugs...

256
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:13,059
Mmm

257
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,544
 More bugs

258
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:17,179
<i>It's working!</i>
<i>It's working!</i>

259
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,916
<i>Uh-oh, it's working too well.</i>

260
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:23,236
<i>Think sexy thoughts.</i>
<i>Think sexy thoughts!</i>

261
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:26,739
 Bugs with boobs...

262
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,207
Marshall, are
you all right?

263
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,308
You don't seem
to be, um...

264
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,561
Please, uh,
excuse Medium-Sized Fudge.

265
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,382
6 and 3/64 inches.

266
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:37,683
Yeah, he's back
to telling the truth.

267
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:38,951
Okay, Barney,

268
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,719
how are you always able
to do that magic trick

269
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:42,355
where you make doves appear?

270
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:45,574
Special dehydrated birds
I get in Chinatown.

271
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:49,946
I knew it!

272
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:52,231
Okay. Okay.

273
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,583
Will there or will there not

274
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:57,036
be a bear at our wedding?

275
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,571
The truth is...

276
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:00,873
- Barney...
- Oh, come on!

277
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,341
I know that you always say

278
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,709
that you don't
need any kind of

279
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,095
"help" in bed,
but if you, um...

280
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:07,763
I always keep
these on hand.

281
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,215
But be careful.

282
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,634
When you go off, there's
a kickback like a cannon.

283
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:13,519
Thank you.

284
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:17,589
How much a year
do you spend on suits?

285
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:20,309
<i>Kids, I won't bother you</i>
<i>with the number...</i>

286
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,361
<i>but it was a crapload.</i>

287
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:24,213
Around one crapload.

288
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:25,564
That much?

289
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,116
Well... aren't you concerned
about your future?

290
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:28,267
Nope.

291
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,236
Especially since Robin
is massively wealthy.

292
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,671
-- Barney!
- What?

293
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,822
You're rich?

294
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:33,973
L-Like how rich?

295
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:35,241
It's my family's money,
not mine.

296
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,292
I-I don't really know how much.

297
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:37,660
How much is her family worth?

298
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:39,245
6,000 craploads.

299
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,612
Canadian craploads.

300
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:41,947
That much?!

301
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:42,948
But when we dated,

302
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,283
I paid for everything.

303
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:45,901
You didn't pay for everything.

304
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:46,886
He paid for everything.

305
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,771
I pick up our bar tab
all the time.

306
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,423
Three times
in the last nine years.

307
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:52,591
I took you out to tons
of four-star restaurants.

308
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:53,676
Two-star restaurants.

309
00:10:53,678 --> 00:10:55,461
Figuring, on average,
two meals out a week

310
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:56,962
plus 20% tip...

311
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:58,180
12 and a half percent tip.

312
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:00,483
Do you know
how much money you cost me?

313
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,834
What am I?
A prostitute?

314
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:03,319
You are not a prostitute.

315
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:05,404
No, a prostitute
would've been cheaper.

316
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:07,390
Depends on the prostitute.

317
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:09,558
Wait, hold on, Ted
What are we doing?

318
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,976
You're arguing
about Robin's wealth

319
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:13,446
when you really should be asking
me embarrassing questions.

320
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:14,997
He's right.

321
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:15,915
Let's do this.

322
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,366
<i>And so we did it.</i>

323
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,068
<i>We asked Barney</i>
<i>all the questions</i>

324
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,052
<i>we'd always wanted to.</i>

325
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,755
In one night? Four.

326
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:25,391
In one family? Three.

327
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,761
Yes, but not while she
was secretary of state.

328
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:32,381
Yes, but not while <i>she</i> was
secretary of state.

329
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:33,799
Just once.

330
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:36,835
With a French male model Henri.

331
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:38,104
It was late.

332
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,022
We were the last two people
in the club.

333
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:42,475
I was lonely and I figured,
why not try it?

334
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:46,545
That was the only time
I ever split a cab.

335
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:49,398
Yes, but not the M.I.T.
you're thinking of.

336
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,284
The Magician's Institute
of Teaneck.

337
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:55,988
I've had sex
in Ted's bed 14 times.

338
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,525
I asked if you wear
shoulder pads.

339
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:02,044
I think I've just got
one question left.

340
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,612
And it's a biggie.

341
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,715
Barney Stinson...

342
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:08,968
...what do you do for a living?

343
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:12,905
You did it.

344
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:15,707
You banged your wife to sleep.

345
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,893
Nice job...

346
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,231
Still-Big Fudge.

347
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:27,019
I wuv you, Mommy.

348
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:28,187
Unpause.

349
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:31,598
<i>Kids, in all the time</i>
<i>we knew Barney,</i>

350
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:34,658
<i>there was one question he would</i>
<i>always answer the same way.</i>

351
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,393
Seriously, what is it
that you do?

352
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,778
Please.

353
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,745
Okay, seriously.

354
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:40,414
What do you do for a living?

355
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,049
Please.

356
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:44,284
Are you finally gonna tell me
exactly what your job is?

357
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:45,953
Please.

358
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:48,772
<i>So, naturally, this was</i>
<i>a pretty big moment for us.</i>

359
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:52,742
Well, what do you do
for a living?

360
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,081
Please.

361
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,349
God, he's not telling us.

362
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:00,350
More booze.

363
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:02,803
Not so fast, princess.

364
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,638
I guess subtle clues
and the bar tab

365
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,607
are two things
you just don't pick up.

366
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:07,757
Because...

367
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,227
I think he is telling us.

368
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:12,529
Tell us more about this job.

369
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:14,681
<i>Well, as you know,</i>

370
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:16,283
<i>back in my hippie days,</i>

371
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:18,235
<i>a business man came</i>
<i>into my coffee shop,</i>

372
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,070
<i>told me money was</i>
<i>all that mattered,</i>

373
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,488
<i>and stole my girlfriend.</i>

374
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,108
<i>That's when I decided</i>
<i>to become awesome.</i>

375
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,645
<i>But I had no idea how to break</i>
<i>into the corporate world.</i>

376
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,047
<i>So, hoping he wouldn't</i>
<i>recognize me,</i>

377
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,781
<i>I went to the one person</i>
<i>from whom</i>

378
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:34,384
<i>I knew I could learn</i>
<i>everything.</i>

379
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:35,802
Do we know each other, bro?

380
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:39,473
We're all connected
in Gaia's great tapestry of...

381
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,558
No.

382
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,893
We don't.

383
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,728
Bro.

384
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,347
Wow, you went to M.I.T.

385
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,515
Pretty impressive.

386
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:51,401
I did get a perfect score
on the A.C.T.'s.

387
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:54,404
Advanced Card Tricks.

388
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:55,606
Well, look, buddy.

389
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,107
You got a sweet résumé.

390
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,192
But we don't have any openings
you're qualified for.

391
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:01,862
They set me up!
It was a trap! It's a trap!

392
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:06,466
We have one opening
you'd be perfect for.

393
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:08,535
Great. What do I do?

394
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,621
Please.

395
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:13,040
"Provide Legal Exculpation
And Sign Everything."

396
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,257
Just show up every day,

397
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,976
scribble your name on
a bunch of documents,

398
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:18,011
and we'll pay you
16 craploads a year.

399
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:20,297
Deets are in the contract.

400
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,739
I'll give you time
to think about it.

401
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:24,718
I'll take it.

402
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,769
Hold on.

403
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,421
Did you even read this
before signing it?

404
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:28,388
No.

405
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,723
You're hired.

406
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,276
We'll work on that.

407
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,645
<i>Wait.</i>

408
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:35,646
That's your job?

409
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:37,864
You sign sketchy,
legally binding documents

410
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:40,017
that could implicate you
for God knows what?

411
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,169
Best job ever, right?

412
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:45,455
No more pausing.

413
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:47,157
We're getting
through this argument.

414
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,042
Okay.

415
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:51,011
No potshots at my mom.

416
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:52,796
Fine, no distracting me
with your calves.

417
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:54,998
Fine.

418
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:01,054
Look, I love you, Lilypad.

419
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,723
I love you, Marshmallow.

420
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,641
Now...

421
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:09,613
...how could you take
that job without telling me?!

422
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,564
Baby, I'm sorry, but they needed
an answer right away.

423
00:15:12,565 --> 00:15:13,681
This is a huge opportunity,

424
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:15,400
it could be very good
for our family,

425
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:17,352
and we have to
at least talk about it.

426
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:20,104
Sorry, you lost your chance
to talk about it

427
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,156
when you didn't talk about it.

428
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,475
We're going to Italy.

429
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:25,943
But I could be a judge.

430
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:29,080
We can't give that up for
what is clearly just a hobby.

431
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,248
Pause.

432
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,499
No pause.

433
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:33,484
That "hobby" is my dream.

434
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,169
We're going to Italy.

435
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:36,254
But it's my dream to...

436
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:37,505
We are going to Italy!

437
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:38,873
Baby, can you just...?

438
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,508
We are going to Italy!

439
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,709
Don't you get it?

440
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,878
You went behind my back.

441
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,596
You hurt me.

442
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:49,567
You were more selfish
than I have ever been to you.

443
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:54,472
You broke up with me
and moved to San Francisco.

444
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,392
Barney!
You're being stupid.

445
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,894
The-the-the company is
setting you up as their fall guy

446
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,480
for all of their
illegal activities.

447
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:05,316
No, you guys are being stupid.

448
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,868
Especially Ted.

449
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,453
What? I didn't say anything.

450
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:12,240
<i>And then, kids, Barney revealed</i>
<i>to us his master plan.</i>

451
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,776
<i>It all went down a few months</i>
<i>after the wedding.</i>

452
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,694
Hey, Greg?

453
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,046
I know you're busy,

454
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:20,114
but FYI, I've been colluding
with the Feds.

455
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,382
They know everything.

456
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:22,917
And they're
on their way up right now

457
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,552
to shut down this division
and arrest you.

458
00:16:24,554 --> 00:16:25,887
Door closed or...?

459
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,221
What?

460
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:28,589
Why would you do that?

461
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:31,225
Oh, gosh,
countless moral reasons...

462
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:32,643
could have applied,

463
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:36,431
but this is pretty much revenge
for stealing my girlfriend.

464
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,048
<i>See? That day, I vowed</i>

465
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,551
<i>I would do everything</i>
<i>in my power to track you down,</i>

466
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,270
<i>gain your trust,</i>

467
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:45,022
<i>and then destroy you.</i>

468
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,324
Who are you?

469
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,358
Who am I?

470
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,026
Just a guy who served you

471
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:50,561
coffee once.

472
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:51,846
Peace out, loser.

473
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:53,698
 Barney Stinson,
Barney Stinson

474
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,333
You son of a bitch!
 That guy's awesome

475
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:58,068
I will destroy you!
Get your hands off of me.

476
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,189
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

477
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,541
Awesome.

478
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,009
Why are you

479
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:06,594
bringing up San Francisco?

480
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:08,629
That was seven years ago.

481
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,581
Because you are being

482
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,967
selfish all over again.

483
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:14,852
Marshall, I apologized

484
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:17,421
over and over again.

485
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:20,141
Now you're saying you
never have forgiven me?

486
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:21,275
There is

487
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:24,195
nothing more important to me
than our family.

488
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:25,446
You know that.

489
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,697
Well, let me ask.

490
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,233
What if you had found
success in San Francisco?

491
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,452
How do I know that you even

492
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:32,670
would've come back to me?

493
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:34,438
Stop it.

494
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,907
Are Marvin and I

495
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:38,543
and any other future children
we may have

496
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:41,129
just some consolation prize?

497
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:43,297
I have to get out of here.

498
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:46,584
Babe?

499
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,087
So, Barney,

500
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,589
I still haven't
heard you pronounce

501
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:53,007
that last syllable.

502
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,228
At our wedding, will there be

503
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,680
a ring bear-er?

504
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,934
The truth is...

505
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:06,838
...yes, there will be
a ring bear-er.

506
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,823
His name is Trevor Hudson,

507
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,958
I worked with his mother,
and he's adorable.

508
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,778
I want our wedding
to be perfect, Robin.

509
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,613
Me, too.

510
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:17,648
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.

511
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,783
He's okay to crash
with you, right?

512
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,868
Yup, we'll see you
in the morning.

513
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,537
Hmm.

514
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,704
I love you.

515
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,506
I love you, too.

516
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:32,296
Okay, I got one last question
for you.

517
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,398
And I can't believe
I haven't asked it yet.

518
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,034
Dude, you're getting
married tomorrow.

519
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,171
- How are you doing?
- Good.

520
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,773
I mean, I'm a little nervous,

521
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:46,510
but I love Robin more
than I've ever loved anyone,

522
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:49,130
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to make her happy.

523
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,648
For a long time,

524
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,850
deep down,

525
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:55,019
I've felt sort of...

526
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,788
broken?

527
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,241
I don't feel that way anymore.

528
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,526
Robin, along with the idea

529
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,296
that vengeance
will soon be mine,

530
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:09,133
has made me 100% awesome.

531
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,401
I'm proud of you, buddy.

532
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:13,387
Globan froban.

533
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,472
Ho, ho, ho.

534
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:15,473
Okay.

535
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:16,724
Come on, Jabba.

536
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:17,675
Big day tomorrow.

537
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,844
Tab for the night?

538
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:21,378
Just so you know,

539
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,899
those last few rounds of 35-year
Glen McKenna were not cheap.

540
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:25,983
Whoa.

541
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,051
Um...

542
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:28,402
you know what?

543
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:29,687
Charge them to the bride's room.

544
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:30,855
Thank you.

545
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:31,889
Come on.

546
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:33,824
Let's go. We got you.

547
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:36,577
<i>Kids, it's your</i>
<i>grandmother's favorite rule.</i>

548
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,930
<i>Nothing good happens</i>
<i>after 2:00 a.m.</i>

549
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:42,066
Hi. I-I know it's late,
but I've got to get out of here.

550
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:45,086
Marshall and I
just had a huge fight.

551
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:47,371
You will?

552
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:50,124
Oh, my God, thank you.

553
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,971
Okay, here we go.

554
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,140
- You good, yeah?
- Yeah.

555
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:08,559
Okay.

556
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,593
Okay.

557
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:10,695
Everything is fine.

558
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:11,779
Okay? Just don't freak out.

559
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:12,763
I'm not freaking out.

560
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:13,781
I was talking to myself.

561
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:15,316
Do you have the baby?

562
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:16,667
- The elevator!
- What?!

563
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:18,402
Marshall and Lily are right.
It never gets old.

564
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:19,870
Unless you're crowning.

565
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,706
- So proud of you.
- Thank you.

566
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,374
Penny is proud of you.

567
00:20:23,376 --> 00:20:24,992
Let's go get you a brother.

568
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:26,594
- Okay?
- Hmm?

569
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:27,662
You want a brother?
All right?

570
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:29,947
I love you.
I love you, too.

571
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:31,115
You're gonna be great.

572
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:32,266
Yeah, okay.

573
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:34,885
<i>2:00 a.m., it's a good rule,</i>

574
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:37,287
<i>but every rule</i>
<i>has an exception.</i>

575
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:40,057
<i>And for us,</i>
<i>that exception was you, Luke.</i>

576
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,926
We're having a baby!

577
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:49,685
Come on, Trevor Hudson.

578
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:51,070
It's feeding time.
