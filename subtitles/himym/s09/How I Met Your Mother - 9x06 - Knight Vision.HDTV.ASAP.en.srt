00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:02,282
TED:
<i>Look at this,</i>

2
00:00:02,283 --> 00:00:04,249
your wedding weekend.
I know.

3
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:06,553
This close to finally
having sex again.

4
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:07,988
It's been forever.

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,523
Oh, you and Robin
been abstaining?

6
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:10,490
Talking about you, Ted.

7
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:12,642
Now here's the deal:
every hookup

8
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,478
at a weekend wedding is decided
at Friday night drinks.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,114
Get stuck with
the wrong girl

10
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:19,482
tonight, the only action you'll
be getting all weekend

11
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:22,152
is a self-five,
and I don't mean the cool kind.

12
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:24,705
<font color="#D900D9">[Chuckles]</font>
Self-five! That's the cool kind.

13
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:26,173
Well, that's a big decision.

14
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,125
The biggest.

15
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:31,461
It brings to mind
that religious text

16
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:33,513
which we hold most sacred:

17
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:36,984
<i>Indiana Jones and</i>
<i>the Last Crusade.</i>

18
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:39,686
Remember?
They entered a chamber.

19
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:42,505
Really? I'm the one working
with the Nazis?

20
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:45,726
Ted, just... just... okay?

21
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:48,011
Yeah.
They had to choose

22
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:50,346
which cup was
this special cup.

23
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:51,865
I forget what
it was called,

24
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,700
but it's like the
Holy Grail of cups.

25
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:56,536
It was the Holy Grail.
Of cups, exactly.

26
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:59,706
So the Nazi confederate
chose, and...

27
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,992
<font color="#D900D9">[Quietly]</font>
Please don't make me do that...

28
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:04,461
Ted, Ted, the confederate
Nazi chose, and...? - I...

29
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:06,046
Okay, okay.

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,697
Oh.

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,870
And so now I'm gonna explode.

32
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:15,255
<font color="#D900D9">[Explosion Sounds]</font>

33
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:17,007
He chose...

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,475
poorly.

35
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:22,562
Then Indy picked
a cup, and...

36
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,318
You chose...

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,719
wisely.

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,641
<font color="#D900D9">[Playing Surf Guitar]</font>

39
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:38,061
So choose wisely, Ted.

40
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:41,114
To help you decide,
I spent all day yesterday

41
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:42,532
picking your top
three prospects.

42
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:43,617
And I helped.

43
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,702
It was either that
or writing our vows.

44
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:46,753
Uch! Gag.

45
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:50,040
Sophia was Robin's
college roommate,

46
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:53,093
and she's apparently "a bit
of a screamer" in the sack.

47
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:54,410
Yeah, mid-sex,

48
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:56,680
she sounds exactly like
a car alarm from the '90s.

49
00:01:56,682 --> 00:02:01,768
You know, whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo,
ooh-uh, ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah.

50
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,419
Dudes love it.

51
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,523
Cassie is the daughter
of my mom's best friend.

52
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:09,810
Sad story: 12 years ago,
her gymnast career

53
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:13,964
was tragically cut short
when her boobs got too big.

54
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:16,266
Grace is a new coworker.

55
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,286
She's had six different
positions at the firm,

56
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,404
and that was just at
the Christmas party.

57
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:22,656
Ooh.

58
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:24,574
So, Grace doesn't arrive till later,
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:27,160
I recommend
<font color="#D900D9">[Whistles]</font> Sophia.

60
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:31,915
I strongly feel that you
should strongly feel her.

61
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,917
I guess it's decided, then.

62
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,702
Ted, right?
Yeah.

63
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:37,337
I'm Cassie.

64
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,589
Oh... something tells me

65
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:42,976
that we are gonna have a lot
of fun this weekend. <font color="#D900D9">[Chuckles]</font>

66
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,063

67
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,135

68
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:54,104
poorly.

Hey, there's our minister.

72
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:12,589
Oh, what a sweet-looking old...

73
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:15,625
Ah! He looks scary.

74
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:16,993
Looks can be
deceiving, Lily.

75
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,328
But not in this case.

76
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,796
He's a mean old tool.

77
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:24,384
Oh, he can't be that bad.

78
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,686
I'll get him to come around.
Just...

79
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,606
Hi, Reverend,

80
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,142
I'm Lily Aldrin,
the maid of honor.

81
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,810
Not too much honor.

82
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,046
You're dressed like a whore.

83
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,449
<font color="#D900D9">[Mouthing]</font>

84
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:43,670
So what's going on?
Why aren't you telling your wife

85
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,005
you got an offer to be a judge?

86
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:47,507
Lily had her heart set
on us moving to Rome,

87
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,342
so I have to tell her in person.

88
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,628
That way, I know that I can
convince her

89
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,230
that we need to stay.

90
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:56,583
In the courtroom,
they call me The Convincer.

91
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:58,501
They really call you that?

92
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:01,588
I convinced them
to call me that.

93
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,273
But you have to prepare
for your court cases.

94
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,642
Did you prepare
for talking to Lily?

95
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:06,910
I don't need to prepare, okay?

96
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,546
I can craft a nice...

97
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,081
thingy.

98
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,134
Oh, wow I'm totally...

99

100
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:16,519

00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,104

I'm sorry, Ted, I don't know.

104
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,860
I'm just so tired
of this routine:

105
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:25,728
we flirt, we have a few drinks,

106
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,081
and then we end the night
with meaningless sex.

107
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,200
Oh...

108
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,335
yeah.

109
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:33,920
Me, too.

110
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:36,339
Do you want to start the night
with meaningless sex

111
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,624
and then flirt later?

112
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:38,908

So how did you
and your husband meet?

143

of college.

144

00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,096

What did <i>you</i> do wrong?

154
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:12,052
We really wanted him
to marry us.

155
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:14,354
His church has cute
coming out the wazoo,

156
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:16,506
but when we met with him...

157
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,341
No pets in my church.

158
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:20,927

159

163

that I turn down
most wedding requests.

164

Particularly from boozy,
promiscuous Manhattanites

165
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,912
who only want me
to marry them because

166
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:43,249
my church has "cute
coming out the wazoo."

167
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,503
That is the total
opposite of us.

168
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,055

how did you two meet?

<i>that I should knock</i>
<i>on this one door.</i>

177
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,576
BARNEY:
<i>I opened the door.</i>

178
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:11,111
<i>And it was destiny.</i>

179
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:14,764
Hi.

180
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:16,449
Hi.

181
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,734
BOTH:
We've been together ever since!

182
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:21,070
You stole our story
of how we met?!

183
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,540
We had to! Your story is so sweet!
Mm.

184
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,408
You didn't even kiss
till the third date.

185
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,243
By our third date,
I'd hit more bases

186
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:29,946
than Bob Hope on a USO tour.
Topical.

187
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,248
Now Reverend Lowell
knows that we lied to him.

188
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,501
What if he cancels
our wedding?

189
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:36,219
What? That's ridiculous.

190
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,520
Barney, Robin,
I need to speak

191
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:39,556
with you in private immediately.

192
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:42,275
And it's not just
losing my job,

193
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:45,695
my car just got stolen
with all my stuff in it.

194
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,630
And now I think
I'm getting the flu!

195
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,432
I'm sorry.

196
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,568
I've been talking
for, like, a half an hour.

197
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,753
It's fine.
40 minutes. It's fine.

198
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:56,539
Still, I think I would be able
to handle all of this

199

203
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,508
Okay! I should go back
to the beginning.

204
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,177
Oh, no, before the beginning.

205
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,561

<i>Man, this girl is a drag!</i>

207
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:24,234
If I hurry, I bet I still have

208
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,769
<i>Okay, I'll get one more drink</i>
<i>with Cassie, then bail.</i>

209
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,354
But where, bar or dining room?

210
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:30,607
<i>Bar or dining room?</i>

211
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:32,859
For my fourth date
with Wesley, we went...

212
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:36,029
Cassie, let's get one more drink
in the dining room.

213
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:37,881
You chose...

214
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,034
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

215
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:43,119
Hey! We just ordered
appetizers.

216
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,254
Sit down, you two!

217
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,624
...Ha-poorly!

218
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:53,018
Marshall, you're walking into
the biggest fight of your life.

219
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,603
You have to be prepared.
You have to be tough.

220
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:57,221
I am tough!
No, you're not.

221
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:58,389
You make some good points.

222
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:00,258
Now, what exactly
are you gonna say to Lily

223
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,525
when you walk
through that door?

224
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,144
Okay.

225
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:04,345
Hey, baby.

226
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:05,863
So, listen,
I got this phone call...

227
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,331

You haven't seen her in a week.

229
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:10,902
Where's the "I missed you"?
How about a kiss?

230
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:12,787
Nothing about her new hairstyle?

231
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,238

I can't actually see...

232
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,323

234
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:19,043
Mmm.

235
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:20,044
I missed you.

236
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,463
And your hairstyle so much.

237

239
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:28,419
Okay, that's creepy.

240
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:29,553
Don't break character.

241
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:31,138
Okay, um...

242
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,958
So, listen, I got this
phone call last week, and I...

243
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,343
DAPHNE:
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

244
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,178
Acknowledge her own views
on the matter first.

245
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,596
Start over.

246
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:40,848
Lily, hi, mwah.

247
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,316
I missed you
and your hairstyle so much.

248
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:43,801
<font color="#D900D9">[Daphne's Voice]</font>
I missed you, too.

249
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:46,671
Okay, so, I know
that you're excited for Rome.

250
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,522
I'm more excited
for bed tonight.

251
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:53,110
While I was away,
uh, I got a phone call.

252
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:54,829
To be a judge.

253
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:56,013
What the damn hell?!

254
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,147
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

255
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,333
Lily does not say
"What the damn hell."

256
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:00,918
Well, I've never met her
but, yes, she does.

257
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,586
You make some good points.
Wow.

258
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:04,388
You are terrible at this.

259
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,824
<font color="#D900D9">[Sighs]</font>
Why did we lie?

260
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:08,292
We have to come clean.

261
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:10,945
Frankly,
I am appalled.

262
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:12,346
I know. I...
Your friend

263
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:15,900
Lily just tried to pass off
your sweet story

264
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:18,853
of how you met as her own.

265
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,640
That lying little tart!
I am horrified and relieved!

266
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:26,610
Does Lily have any... problems
that you're aware of?

267
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:27,862
Drinking.
Drugs.

268
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,181

She's been drinking drugs.

269
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:32,450
LOWELL:
<i>Well,</i>

270
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:34,351
I talked to Barney
and Robin,

271
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:36,370
and, let me say, I'm shocked.

272
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:37,872
You should be.

273
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,657
Flat-out lying to me like that?

274
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:41,756
We are not misunderstanding
each other.

275
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:45,264
How dare you pretend their
beautiful story is actually your own.

276

286
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,884

a hundred women,

308
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:42,553

00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,963
So your dream job's
more important

350
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:00,097
than my dream job?

351
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:03,167
Hey, I gave up peeing
in the shower for you.

352
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,185
Nope.

353
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:05,219
Start over.

354
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,554
So your dream job's

355
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,389
more important
than my dream job?

356
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:09,506
Of course not.

357
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:10,741
But this isn't

358
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:12,476
just about our future.

359
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:14,061
It's about everyone's.

360
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:15,062
As a lawyer,

361
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,730
I couldn't stop big oil
from polluting,

362
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,232
but as a judge...

363
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:19,483
well, maybe I can.

364
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,285
And that's why I took the job.

365
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,187
You've just been "convincered."

366
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:24,488
Wait.

367
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,373
You already took the job?

368
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,159
Without even talking
to your wife?

369
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:29,860
Start over.

370
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:31,245
Start over... start over.

371
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,214
What the damn hell?!

372
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,300
Hi, Reverend
Lowell?

373
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,302
Whew.
Made it through my half.

374
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:39,870
You're up.

375
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,055
Oh. Uh...

376
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,290
The-the truth is,
we-we have

377
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,142
a complicated,
messy history

378
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:46,727
that-that we're
not too proud of.

379
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,012
But...

380
00:13:48,014 --> 00:13:49,346
we're sorry
that we lied,

381
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:53,000
and hope that
you can forgive us.

382
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:57,905
Nope, I can't do it.

383
00:13:57,907 --> 00:13:59,940
You're going to have
to find a new officiant.

384
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,225
Okay.

385
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:02,326
Well, these
things happen.

386
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:03,360
And a new church.

387
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:05,829

Thanks for
being so great.

392
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:18,609
I'm lucky to have you
around this weekend.

393
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:20,594
Ooh, yeah...

394
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:22,096
About that...

395
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:25,015
I should really go see
about the, uh...

396
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:26,884
So, sex?
My room is very close.

Your parents were just saying
you have a new boyfriend.

403

"Boyfriend" is
a little premature.

404
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,981
Though I did
pay for dinner.

What do you say we give
these two old flames

413
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,384
a chance to...
catch up alone,

414
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:01,969
and maybe you and I
could go get a drink.

...poorly.

420
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:20,013
Look, I know. I shouldn't
have taken the job

421
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:21,096
without telling Lily.

422
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,848
Why are you so ticked off
about it?

423
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,017
Because I know
what she's going through.

424
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,068
I always dreamed

425
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,621
of having a career
I could be proud of,

426
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,706
but my husband never
supported me.

427
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,891
Eventually,

428
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:34,677
I had to... make a choice.

429
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,744
Now, every day,

430
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:36,962
I'm out there,

431
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:39,131
I'm fighting for the good guys,
and I love it.

432
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,399
Doesn't

433
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:41,917
your wife deserve th, too?

434
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,005
Wow. Um, maybe
you're right.

435
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:49,341
I didn't realize how many
sacrifices you'd made.

436
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,977
What is it you do, anyway?

437
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:53,762
I'm a lobbyist
for a big oil company.

438
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:55,380
What the damn hell?!

439
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,734
You know
that I'm an environmentalist!

440
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,385
That's why you don't want me
to become a judge.

441
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:02,220
But you're the reason
I <i>have</i> to become a judge!

442
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:04,690
You're the devil incarnate!
And outcarnate!

443
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:06,892
Every kind of carnate!

444
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:09,645
Please, is-is there

445
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:10,879
any way you'd reconsider?

446
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,581
No! No, no!

447
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,750
You two are both
terrible people.

448
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:17,820
Who found each other
in this crazy world!

00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:28,347
You know what?
You're right.

454
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,749
We shouldn't have lied
about our story.

455
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:32,851
I <i>love</i> our story.

456
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,803
Sure, it's messy,
but it's the story

457
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:37,189
that got us here,
about to get married.

458
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:39,525
I love it, too.

459
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,493
Every messy chapter.

460
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:43,979
I love that you slept
with over 250 women

461
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:46,115
before deciding that
I was your favorite.

462
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:47,283
This is killing me.

463
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:48,834
And I love
that we just had

464
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:50,435
to keep having sex
with each other,

465
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:51,904
even when we were dating
other people.

466
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:53,438
This is <i>really</i> killing me.

467
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,107
And I love that your
marriage proposal

468
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,209
involved a strip
club, lying to me,

469
00:16:57,211 --> 00:17:01,096
and pretending to bang the
woman I <i>hate</i> for two months.

470
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:02,665
I love that we keep
a running tally

471
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,249
of all the different rooms
we've had sex in.

472
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:07,503
I love that two weeks ago, we
put this room on that list.

525
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,929
Our minister just died.

526
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,914
Wh...?
We can still use the church,

527
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,766
but we only have two days
to find a new officiant.

528
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:19,134
Unless...

529
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:20,335
BARNEY:
Wedding at Bernie's!

530
00:19:20,336 --> 00:19:21,836
We're not doing
Wedding at Bernie's!

531
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:24,755
Wow. Oh, that's terrible.

532
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:26,724
Should I make a toast
in his honor?

533
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:28,309
<font color="#D900D9">[Whispers]</font>
No.

534
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:29,727
Of course I should.

535
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,129
Everyone?

536
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,764
To Reverend Lowell.

537
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:35,733
He may have
passed away

538
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:37,134
tonight, but
he will always...

539
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:39,170
Uncle Robert died?!

540
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:41,572
Oh, no.

544
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,833
Have a nice weekend.

NARRATOR: <i>All that night, I did nothing</i>
<i>but choose poorly.</i>

546
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:56,170
<i>But thanks to Cassie,</i>

547
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:58,723
<i>I didn't get together</i>
<i>with anyone at that wedding.</i>

548
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,041
<i>And if I had,</i>

549
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:04,128
<i>well, then, your mother</i>
<i>and I might never have met.</i>

550
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,998
<i>So, maybe, in a way,</i>
<i>I chose wisely.</i>

Boo-uh! Boo-uh! Eee!

553
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,746
<i>didn't feel like it</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

554
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,030
Aah! Aah! Aah!

Wesley.

559
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,839
I've been dying
to say that one all night.

560
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,626
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

561
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:29,993
The truth is, you're right.

562
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,830
It was wrong of me to take
that job without telling Lily.

563
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,800
I don't need to be tough
with her. I need to be fair.

564
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,435
Thanks, Marshall.
Mm.

565
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,553
I should also apologize.

566
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:41,772
While you were filling the tank,

567
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,358
I may have been so angry,

568
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,545
I texted your wife with the news

569
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,214
that you took that judge offer.
