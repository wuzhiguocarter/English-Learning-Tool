NARRATOR: <i>Kids, Barney and Robin's</i>

00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:12,465
<i>Well, not just us.</i>

4
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,200
One ticket to Farhampton,
please.

NARRATOR:
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

6
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:17,337
(horn honks)

7
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,722
Who are you honking at?
You.

8
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,674
You're going 40 in a 65.

9
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:23,793
Pick it up, Grandma!

10
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:25,845
Look, I'm happy to rock it up
into the 50s,

11
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:29,565
but I'm gonna need a hand...
or two.

12
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,718
Oh, no. Not the driving gloves.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,386
In 99.9% of highway accidents,

14
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:35,722
the driver was not
wearing gloves.

15
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:36,773
Because they're stupid.

16
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:38,474
They don't help you
drive better.

17
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,143
That's why no one wears them.

18
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:43,429
Then why is it called...
the glove compartment?

19
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,531
I am not
having this argument again.

20
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:48,434
Now, as you know, a Mosby
road trip is not only safe,

21
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,385
but informative.

22
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,521
Chiggedy-check it.

<i>Excellent Adventure?</i>

25
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,745
That baby's stuffed to the rings
with fun facts

26
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:01,047
about our unsung neighbor
to the east-- Long Island.

27
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,466
For instance, just up
ahead, the historic

28
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,668
childhood home of
Florian van Otterloop,

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,886
the Dutch bucklesmith

30
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,888
who revolutionized
the belt industry.

31
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,923
Uh, fun story
about that color-blind genius.

32
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,458
When he...
Please stop!

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,061
Well, I was just gonna
slow down for pictures,

34
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:18,398
but that level of enthusiasm
can't go unrewarded.

in their flower

Ring <i>bear-er.</i>

00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,332
Ring bear.

46
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:55,468
Are you planning
some crazy stunt

47
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,970
with a dangerous wild animal
at our wedding?

48
00:01:57,972 --> 00:01:59,188

Oh, boy.

My brother wants to know

what time he "goes on"
at the reception.

53
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,113
What does that mean?

54
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:11,434
Every wedding he attends,
James insists on... performing.

I have invited Scherbatskys
from all over Canada,

66
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,513
and they are Canuckin' nuts.

67
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,849
Like my cousin Ruth
from the Yukon.

68
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:45,351
I don't like to encourage
Canadian stereotypes,

69
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:48,604
but that woman
practically rides a moose.

70
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:50,222
(laughs)

71
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,657
Does she actually ride a moose?

72
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,692
Yeah.

73
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,110
And, uh,

74
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:56,312
I'm worried she'll bring it
to the wedding.

75
00:02:56,314 --> 00:03:00,333
She and the moose are...
very close.

76
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:03,102
Whoa.

77
00:03:03,104 --> 00:03:06,489
Every wedding's got a wild card,
but we've invited a whole set.

78
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,791
(accordion playing
"Wedding March")

79
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:17,366
Someone is gonna
ruin this wedding.

80
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:21,370
It's just a question
of... who.

81
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:24,123
I'm gonna ruin this wedding!

82
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,641
My wife is
gonna kill me!

83
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,760
PILOT: Flight attendants
prepare for departure.

84
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:30,163
We were gonna move to
Italy for her dream job,

85
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:32,431
so I brought my son
here to Minnesota

86
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,934
to see my mom
before we left.

87
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:38,805
And then I got offered
a job as a judge

88
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:41,324
in New York City,
which is my dream.

89
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,210
But that'll totally
destroy her dream!

90
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:46,746
You are destroying
a lot of dreams right now.

91
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:50,166

92
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:56,973

93
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,091
Wait.

94
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:01,260
If I got this...

95
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,765
(phone chimes)

96
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:08,851
(sighs)

97
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:10,069
Aren't you gonna
check that?

98
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,571
No.

99
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:13,639
It-It's just another
obnoxious update

100
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:14,657
from Marshall's mom.

101
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,658
She's been posting

102
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,327
these "cute" baby pics
of Marvin,

103
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,830
but it's all just propaganda.

104
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,832
First, it was
"Don't move to Italy."

105
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,302
Followed by an extremely subtle
<i>guilt trip.</i>

106
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,074
<i>And then, randomly preachy.</i>

107
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:33,426
Nah, not looking.

108
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:34,977
It's just gonna piss me off.

109
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,712
Why are we exiting again?

110
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,047
Well, if you turn in your binder

111
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:39,849
to the section labeled
"Mennonite Windmills..."

112
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:41,300
Get back on the expressway now.

113
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:42,351
(scoffs)

114
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:45,104
The expressway's
for gloveless amateurs.

115
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,389
I'm done.

116
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,040
There's a train station
coming up; just drop me off.

117
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:50,192
Okay, but some newfangled
train's not gonna stop

118
00:04:50,194 --> 00:04:52,428
at the 40-foot-tall
butter churn in Ronkonkoma!

119
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,848
Yes, but unlike any of
your 18th-century stops,

120
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,184
at least the train will have
a 21st-century toilet!

121
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:00,820
You're a 21st-century toilet!

122
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:01,821
(gasps)

123
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,788
Train now!

124
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,624
Fine!

125
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:07,710
Okay, so far,
I've got 12 wild cards,

126
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:09,028
not counting the ring bear.

127
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,129
Ring bear-er.

128
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,447
Oh, oh, here's another one.

129
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,866
You know how I found out
that I'm one-quarter Canadian

130
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,217
but I've completely
blocked that out

131
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,819
because your nation's ridiculous
and I'm awesome?

132
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:17,887
Sure.

133
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,039
Well, turns out,
I have a crazy cousin Mitch

134
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,390
on that side of the family.

135
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:22,341
That's funny.

136
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,043
I have a crazy
cousin Mitch, too.

137
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:26,012
But I guarantee
he is crazier than yours.

138
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:28,514
He built his own house
from timber he chopped down

139
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,149
from other people's houses.

140
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:31,601
That's funny.

141
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:33,269
My cousin Mitch
is a lumberjack.

142
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,905
Except mine has six fingers.

143
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:37,156
On one hand or total?

144
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:38,524
Total.

145
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,310
Are truckers always
beating him up?

146
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:43,195
Yes, because he has to...

147
00:05:43,197 --> 00:05:44,330
BOTH: ...hitchhike
with his middle finger.

148
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,983
Wait.

149
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:49,585
Is it possible that we're...

150
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:54,624
Could... c-could...
could we be...?

151
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,125
Shh...

152
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,597
Ranjit, could you be a dear
and pull over for a second?

153
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,249
Pulling over!

154
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:06,435
(both chuckle weakly)

155
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,190
(both retching)

156
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,808
All right, train.

157
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,028
Let's show your critics you're
not just a Dumpster on wheels

158
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,596
full of drunk idiots.

159
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:19,882
CONDUCTOR:
We're being held at this station

160
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,350
until further notice.

161
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:23,569
I got to sober up.

162
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:35,009
(phone ringing)

163
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:37,177
Eriksen residence,
Judy speaking.

164
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,729
Why did you post
that judge photo?

165
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,314
Because I'm guilty...

166
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,467
of being one proud mama!

167
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,185
Lily doesn't know
that I took the job,

168
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,820
so if she sees it,
I'm dead.

169
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:47,921
Just take it down, okay?

170
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:48,956
Fine.

171
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,542
Let me just get on the online

172
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,976
so I can Internet.

173
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,579
I love the lingo!

174
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,548
(modem screeching)

175
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,116
Look, Mom,
just-just...

176
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,001
click on the photo
on your wall,

177
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,871
and then under "menu""
click on "options""

178
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:06,373
Some kind of advertisement
popped on.

179
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,841
Oh, my.

180
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,461
That appears to be pornography.

181
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,563
Just click
on "options""

182
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,099
(whispering):
It's men with other men.

183
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,266
(whispering loudly):
Just click on "options"!

184
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,334
Excuse me!

185
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,119
Are there any other seats
left on this plane?

186
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:20,120
No.

187
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:21,388
Hell, I've been
going to Pilates.

188
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,524
I can just hang on
to the landing gear like this.

189
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,541
Sorry, ma'am.

190
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,527
I only signed up for Pilates,

191
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,196
I haven't actually
started going yet.

192
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,281
I didn't sign up.

193
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,535
LILY:
<i>No, I'm not looking.</i>

194
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,571
<i>I don't need to see</i>
<i>my child used against me.</i>

195
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:41,542
<i>My sweet, beautiful child</i>
<i>who I haven't seen in a week...</i>

196
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,295
<i>whose head smells like love</i>
<i>and unicorn teardrops,</i>

197
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:47,364
<i>and why are trains</i>
<i>so lonely?!</i>

198
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,382
<i>Damn it, I'm looking!</i>

199
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,666
WOMAN:
Hey, are you okay?

200
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,385
You look stressed.

201
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,469
Plus, you muttered

202
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,720
a few words out loud.

203
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,705
I heard "lonely" and "unicorn,"

204
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,341
which actually gave me
a great idea

205
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,876
for a children's book,
so thank you.

206
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:01,545
Are you okay?

207
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,063
No.

208
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,982
But there's nothing you can do.

209
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,066
Do you want a cookie?

210
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,717
(crying):
Yes.

211
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:08,902
Yes, I do.

212
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,154
Wow.

213
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,355
You just took a cookie

214
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,990
from a complete stranger
on a train.

215
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,191
I like how trusting you are.

216
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,160
There could be drugs
or poison in there.

217
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,811
But there's not, is there?

218
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,229
No idea,
I found them under my seat.

219
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,447
No!

220
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:21,748
Kidding! Sorry!

221
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,951
You looked stressed, so I
thought you could use a cookie,

222
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,586
then I thought
you could use a joke.

223
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,254
I should have stopped
at the cookie.

224
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,288
You know what?

225
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,207
I don't care
if these are poisoned.

226
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,842
There's chocolate
and peanut butter

227
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,510
and caramel in these sumbitches.

228
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,912
I call them "Sumbitches"!

229
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:36,930
(laughing)

230
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:38,048
NARRATOR:
<i>And that's how Lily</i>

231
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,749
<i>met your mother.</i>

232
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,919
Are Cousin Mitch and I
directly related?

233
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,438
No, Mom, I'm asking

234
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,523
is Cousin Mitch
a blood relative?

235
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,891
I'm not asking
about Cousin Pete,

236
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,276
I'm asking about Cousin Robin!

237
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,310
Mitch!

238
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,395
Cousin Mitch!

239
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,696
Well, just find out
from Uncle Frank

240
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,697
and call me back!

241
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,399
Well, then, go
visit Cousin Cecil

242
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,568
at his sky-diving school
and ask him!

243
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,287
Oh, God, he did?

244
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:02,489
Well, I guess that can happen

245
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,074
no matter
how experienced you are.

246
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,959
I'm so sorry.

247
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,329
(exhales)

248
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,497
got fired.

249
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:11,781
(sighs):
Oh.

250
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:16,978
That's a relief.

251
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,764
Um... I'm so sorry
for your loss.

252
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:24,035
It may be <i>our</i> loss.

253
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,937
(both shudder)

254
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,972
Just click
on "options"!

255
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:31,042
All I see is a man
holding a bratwurst!

256
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,276
Oh.

257
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,913
No, the pornography's back.

258
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,948
I said, please turn off
all electronic devices.

259
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,634
Oh. (laughs)

260
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:41,970
This isn't an
electronic device.

261
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:43,788
This is actually a toy.

262
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,623
For my son.

263
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,009
We call it Phone-y.
(scoffs)

264
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:49,894
I call you phony.

265
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:53,131
We can't take off
till you hang up.

266
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,933
Okay, enough.
Give me that phone!

267
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:56,284
Just click
on "options""

268
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,802
I don't see it!

269
00:09:57,804 --> 00:09:59,687
I said,
give me the phone!

270
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:00,972
Just click
on "options"!

271
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,524
Stop yelling at me!

272
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:03,825
Just click
on "options""

273
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:04,742
Give me the phone.

274
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:05,944
Click on "options"!

275
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:08,046
Click on...
I have a baby!

276
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,148
Please, I-I have to get
to New York.

277
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,833
Yeah, well, you should
have thought about that

278
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:12,867
before you attacked me.

279
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,252
All right, boys,
you got this?

280
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,537
Good.

281
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,505
Let's get this bird in the air.
Ah, you're both

282
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:19,007
banned from this flight.

283
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,795
So I was driving with my
friend, who thinks he's

284
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,463
"The Road Trip Master."

285
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:28,349
He has leather driving gloves.

286
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:29,884
Who wears those?

287
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:32,187
Huge dorks, that's who.

288
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:33,438
NARRATOR:
<i>Your mother was lying.</i>

289
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,607
<i>She had her own pair.</i>

290
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:36,858
And he always makes us stop

291
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,811
to see some weird
roadside attraction

292
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:43,181
no one except him
gives a crap about.

293
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,549
Nerd alert.

294
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,417
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, you remember</i>
<i>the seven-hour detour</i>

295
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,952
<i>on our road trip</i>
<i>to Disney World</i>

296
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:50,855
<i>so your mother didn't miss</i>
<i>that goat in South Carolina</i>

297
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:52,407
<i>who could blow smoke rings.</i>

298
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,861
And he won't go one mile an hour
over the speed limit.

299
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:58,329
That would drive me crazy.

300
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:01,416
I would give him
a humiliating nickname

301
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:04,035
until he stopped driving
like a little girl.

302
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,771
NARRATOR:
It was "Lady Tedwina Slowsby."

303
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:09,290
<i>And it worked.</i>

304
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:12,844
Okay, look, if it's
true, if we are...

305
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,212
(gags softly)

306
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,597
You know.

307
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,065
It's really not that big a deal.

308
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,816
Okay, we-we know
we won't have kids.

309
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:20,151
And even if we did,

310
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,070
King Joffrey's parents
were brother and sister,

311
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,738
and he was
a fair and wise leader.

312
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,441
Yeah. Look, no one
ever needs to know but us.

313
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,075
Exactly.

314
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,243
(both chuckle)

315
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:29,527
I know.

316
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,566
BARNEY:
<i>We might have to...</i>

317
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,734
ROBIN:
<i>Take care of Ranjit.</i>

318
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,753
<i>Hey, you just finished my...</i>

319
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:40,922
<i>Creepy telepathic</i>
<i>murder thought.</i>

320
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:44,209
<i>Oh, it must be</i>
<i>a soul mate thing.</i>

321
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:45,576
<i>Unless...</i>

322
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:49,097
<i>it's a weird cousin thing.</i>

323
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,748
(gags softly)

324
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,384
So we'll be good
either way, right?

325
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:54,919
Honey?

326
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:58,606
That's right... sweetie.

327
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,858
Now, get over here, you.

328
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,562
Gah, just try
and stop me.

329
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:17,909
Aw.
Ooh, ooh.

330
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,777
Ooh, mmm, mmm, mmm.

331
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,445
Well, I can't wait
till tonight.

332
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,613
I have got some

333
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:23,915
naughty-naughty-naughty
things planned.

334
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,049
Aw.

335
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,669
Oh, wow, you have certainly
piqued my incest.

336
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,053
Interest. Interest!

337
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:34,425
I still can't believe he dragged
me to the childhood home

338
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:37,712
of some stupid bucklesmith
no one's ever even heard of.

339
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:40,148
Yeah, who cares
about Florian van Otterloop?

340
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,400
I never told you his name.

341
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:43,718
Sumbitch?

342
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,604
I mean, why'd he have to
act that way?

343
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:49,424
He knows I hate
how he gets on road trips.

344
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:52,476
It almost seems like
he wanted you to storm off.

345
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:54,329
But we're going
to the same place.

346
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:57,282
There's no reason
why he'd want to ditch me.

347
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,617
NARRATOR: <i>And suddenly Lily remembered</i>
<i>that a week ago,</i>

348
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:02,220
<i>I'd helped Robin look</i>
<i>for her long-lost locket.</i>

349
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:04,488
<i>But it was gone.</i>

350
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,511
<i>Then Lily told me</i>
<i>the locket actually got stashed</i>

351
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:13,214
<i>in my pencil box,</i>
<i>but when I opened it...</i>

352
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:15,500
<i>the locket wasn't there.</i>

353
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,801
Good.

354
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:17,969
'Cause that locket's trouble.

355
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,137
How? It's-it's just a friendly,

356
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,254
innocent wedding gift.

357
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:21,255
It's not innocent.

358
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:22,940
Ted, you think

359
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:26,177
if you can get that locket
for Robin you'll win her back.

360
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:29,047
Lily, I've let it go.

361
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,536
I mean...
What?

362
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,021
There's, like,
a one percent chance

363
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:39,457
that Stella has the locket
from when we lived together.

364
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,726
Promise me you didn't call
the woman who left you

365
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:44,946
at the altar so that
you could find that locket.

366
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,164
Of course not.

367
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,382
I e-mailed her.

368
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:48,466
Ted.

369
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:49,717
But Stella's living
in L.A. now.

370
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,718
And even if she has it,

371
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,053
it's buried
in some storage unit.

372
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:53,554
She said I'd have
to fly out there

373
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,173
and look for it myself.

374
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:57,541
Promise me you aren't
about to do that.

375
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,310
I promise.

376
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:01,646
Sumbitch!

377
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:18,851
You better hope when Sweaty
finally gets off that phone,

378
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:21,103
he can get me on the next flight
to New York.

379
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,288
I got the password
from my mom.

380
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,856
I'm gonna take that
photo down myself.

381
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:26,908
You know, I don't give
a damn about your photo.

382
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,394
My daughter is giving
a big speech for the Model U.N.

383
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:31,997
at her school, and I'm
gonna miss it because of you.

384
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:34,800
(sighs)

385
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:37,335
Her father and I are separated.

386
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:38,787
She lives with her dad.

387
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,923
And if I don't make it...

388
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:44,876
she's never gonna
trust me again.

389
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:46,995
I'm so sorry.

390
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,814
Wow, that worked on you?

391
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:51,516
Let's hope Pit Stains is
as dumb as you are.

392
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,235
What? Why is this
so hard for my mom?

393
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:54,269
All you do

394
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:55,904
is you click the photo,

395
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:57,939
and then you click on the...

396
00:14:57,941 --> 00:15:00,642
I don't see...
I don't see "options."

397
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:03,028
Just click on "options."

398
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,945
But where is it?

399
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:05,063
Just click on "options."

400
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,281
Is it up on the toolbar?

401
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:08,283
Just click on "options."
It's not there!

402
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:11,536
Just click on "options"!

403
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:15,073
(phone ringing)

404
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:16,591
Hi, Grandma.

405
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:19,177
You-you can explain how
Cousin Mitch is related to us?

406
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,146
Explain, Grandma, explain!

407
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:22,964
Okay, he married
Barney's dad's cousin Renee,

408
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,549
who he met selling Vachon cakes

409
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:26,968
outside a curling bonspiel
in Chicoutimi.

410
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,303
English, Grandma, English!

411
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,939
And on our side of the family,
he was adopted

412
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:32,774
because his real parents
were eaten alive

413
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:33,859
by their sled dogs?

414
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,094
That's awesome!
Thanks, Grandma.

415
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:38,213
(both sigh)

416
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:39,531
So...

417
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,267
So you and I share
no DNA whatsoever.

418
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,369
Let's change that.

419
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,037
(both moaning)

420
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,622
RANJIT:
Don't hold back.

421
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:50,208
This divider is
totally soundproof.

422
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,545
Go all the way.

423
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:55,130
Wait till the hotel?

424
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:56,047
Totally.

425
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,300
Hey, you know what?

426
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:01,136
I'm not worried about a wild
card at our wedding anymore.

427
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,672
Whether it's Uncle Vic
or Aunt Shelly

428
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:04,723
or the ring bear.

429
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,308
Ring bear-er. Er.

430
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,593
Whether any
of those mammals go rogue,

431
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:12,514
our wedding is
gonna be legendary.

432
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:14,900
No "wait for it"?

433
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:17,235
I've got you.

434
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:20,155
I don't have to
wait for it anymore.

435
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:27,863
(phone ringing)

436
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,603
(line ringing)

437
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:35,921
It's a long story,

438
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:38,173
but if we don't beat my friend
out to that wedding,

439
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:39,341
it's gonna be bad.

440
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,960
This is too stressful.
I-I need to see Marvin!

441
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,045
No! You made me promise
not to let you look,

442
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,547
because it's
only gonna upset you.

443
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:48,717
Here, have another sum... bitch.

444
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:51,803
No more sumbitches?!

445
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:53,504
Give me the damn phone!

446
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:54,923
(both scream)

447
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,925
(clamoring) Just go to "edi""
on the toolbar!

448
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,343
No, "account settings"!

449
00:16:58,345 --> 00:16:59,878
Just click
on "options""

450
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,363
Stop!

451
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:04,132
It can't be done.

452
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:07,102
That photo is etched
in eternity.

453
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:09,654
Long after humanity's
reign has ended,

454
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,689
the only traces
of our civilization found

455
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,358
by Earth's new ape masters
will be

456
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,327
the top
of the Statue of Liberty

457
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,545
and this photo of me
pretending to be

458
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:21,299
a judge with a banana gavel.

459
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,435
Well, they'll probably like
the banana thing.

460
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:25,053
The ape masters?

461
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:27,973
Sorry.
Lily's gonna see it,

462
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:30,475
and we're gonna have
the biggest fight of our lives.

463
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:33,895
(chuckles) Oh, I wish I could
see your wife kick your ass.

464
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:36,398
I don't mean a physical fight.

465
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,465
She's not an animal.

466
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,901
I'm sorry I tried
to bite you.

467
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:42,487
I'm sorry that I swatted you
on the nose

468
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:43,738
with a rolled-up magazine.

469
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,341
It's the only way I'll learn.

470
00:17:48,594 --> 00:17:52,497
Look, I haven't seen
my baby in a week.

471
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:54,565
You know what?

472
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,084
Go for it.

473
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,778
It's gone!

474
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,463
It's gone!
(all cheering)

475
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:09,580
You did it!

476
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:12,583
You did it! (laughs)

477
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,271
No new insulting Marvin photo.

478
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:17,889
Hmm.

479
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:22,644
(voice breaks):
No new insulting Marvin photo.

480
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:25,280
I know I'm just a stranger
on a train

481
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:29,534
who you tried to bite, but...
do you want a hug?

482
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,589
(Lily yells)

483
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:54,426
Lily! What the hell?!

484
00:18:57,063 --> 00:19:00,015
Ted and I had some
road trip issues.

485
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:01,816
Did he put on the gloves?
Mm-hmm.

486
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,468
That tackle was justified.

487
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,854
What's this?
It's for you.

488
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,856
Don't open it.

489
00:19:10,976 --> 00:19:12,861
TED: With all
the big changes coming up,

490
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,497
I just wanted Robin
to remember her friends.

491
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,366
We all want nothing but
happiness for you and Barney.

492
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:19,984
Right, Lily?

493
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,754
Right.

494
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,923
Oh, wow.

495
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,291
That was, what, eight years ago?

496
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,325
Yeah.

497
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:29,461
Eight years.

498
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,380
Thanks, Ted.

499
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,688
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get checked in.

500
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,476
Marshall's flight just took off.

501
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:46,177
My boys will be here soon.

502
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:47,729
Oh, yay.

503
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:49,948
NARRATOR: <i>Actually, Lily's boys were</i>
<i>just learning there was</i>

504
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,801
<i>only one more flight out</i>
<i>to New York with one seat left,</i>

505
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:55,203
<i>and it was all the way</i>
<i>across the airport.</i>

506
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:15,673
You're not gonna
tackle me again, are you?

507
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:16,874
I'm the maid of honor.

508
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,810
There's a good chance
that won't be

509
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:20,228
my only tackle of the weekend.

510
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,063
NARRATOR:
<i>It wasn't.</i>

511
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:24,215
Look, I'm sorry.

512
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:27,051
I just got it in my head
that you somehow managed

513
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,820
to track down that locket
in Los Angeles,

514
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,905
and now you were gonna
blow up the wedding.

515
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:32,857
You really think I'm that crazy?

516
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:36,227
(sighs)
I guess that's fair.

517
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:40,165
Look, even though I was wrong,
tell me you aren't thinking

518
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,750
about doing anything
insane this weekend.

519
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:44,702
Of course not.

520
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:47,322
NARRATOR:
<i>And all I can say, kids,</i>

521
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:51,025
<i>is at that moment,</i>
<i>I really thought I meant it.</i>

522
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:55,219
<i>But the truth is...</i>
<i>you never know</i>

523
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,371
<i>who's gonna be the wild card</i>
<i>at a wedding.</i>

524
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:01,126
Hi. One ticket
to Los Angeles, please.

NARRATOR: <i>That afternoon</i>
<i>at the Farhampton Inn,</i>

527
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:13,182
<i>Aunt Lily and I</i>
<i>tried to check in.</i>

528
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,350
Are you chewing gum?

529
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:15,568
You never chew gum.

530
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,469
You shouldn't chew gum
in here.

531
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,189
Nobody cares if
I chew gum, Ted.

532
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:21,240
Are you chewing gum?

533
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:23,109
Yes, she is.
She's chewing gum.

534
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,326
Ooh, can I have a piece?

535
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:26,162
Of course!
Great.

536
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:27,196
Thank you.

537
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,447
Okay, let's chew some gum

538
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,149
and get you guys
all checked in.

539
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:32,201
Ms. Aldrin, how many
keys will you need?

540
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,152
Two, please.

541
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,253
My husband's
getting in later.

542
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:35,838
Excellent, and Mr. Mosby?

543
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,956
Uh, just one, please.

544
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,025
Oh, oh, I-I see.

545
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:41,961
Oh.

546
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:43,913
Well, hang in there.

547
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:45,714
You'll find somebody.

548
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:48,601
Thank you,
front desk stranger.

549
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:50,870
I'm sorry, we just... we just
don't get a lot of singles here.

550
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:51,971
I mean,
look at this place.

551
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:53,506
It's so romantic.

552
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:56,942
Countless babies conceived
within these walls.

553
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:59,361
And one... grisly murder.

554
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:00,512
Now, are you sure
that you wouldn't

555
00:22:00,514 --> 00:22:03,348
feel more comfortable
staying at a motel?

556
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,533
What? No, look.

557
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:06,485
I'm not some miserable,
lonely person.

558
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:07,853
Tell him, Lily.

559
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,455
It's a tough
weekend for him.

560
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:10,489
Bro.

561
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:12,158
We're here for a wedding.
Ouch.

562
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,994
And he used to date the bride.
Ooh, mama.

563
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:16,979
And he's the best man.
Devastating.

564
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:18,581
Could you please
just check us in?

565
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,216
Oh, your rooms aren't
gonna be ready for hours.

566
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:21,917
But in the meantime,

567
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,303
Ms. Aldrin, I definitely think

568
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:26,388
you and your husband should
check out the lighthouse.

569
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,141
It's a beautiful view
of the bay-- so romantic.

570
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:30,176
Oh, wow.

571
00:22:30,178 --> 00:22:31,760
Here's the channel guide

572
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,479
for the TV.

573
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:35,714
Don't listen
to him, Ted.

574
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:38,050
(phone ringing)
You are not alone.

575
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:40,903
In fact, this
whole weekend,

576
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:43,439
it is going to be
nothing but me and...

577
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:44,824
Marshall!

578
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:46,008
Oh, thank God,
you're on your way.

579
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,043
If I had to be here alone,
I would kill myself.

580
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:50,362
How are you doing?

581
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:52,781
I'm fine... Curtis.

582
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,667
I mean, let's do
the math here.

583
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:58,787
One "best man" plus one
"no girlfriend" equals...

584
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:01,540
"Mothers of Farhampton,
lock up your daughters!"

585
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,425
Double guns!

586
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:05,511
(imitating gunshots)

587
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,383
Wow, you're in bad shape.

588
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:12,601
Marshall missed
his flight.

589
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,270
He might not get
here tonight.

590
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:16,755
He might not
get here at all.

591
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:17,940
We...

592
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:19,913
only have a few
of these left.

00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:25,381
Hi...

595
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:26,398
Linus.

596
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,067
Here's how this goes down.

597
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:30,569
If I'm going to make it through
this weekend without my husband,

598
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:32,655
I need you to hook a lady up.

599
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:35,207
Any time you see me
without a drink in my hand,

600
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:37,309
you put a drink in my hand.

601
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:40,379
Are you my guy, Linus?

602
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:42,548
So you want the Kennedy Package?

603
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,133
Bingo.

604
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:47,636
(phone rings)
Go for Barney.

605
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:50,339
Ah.

606
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:52,841
Thank you Linus.

607
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:54,226
Barney,
before you get too upset,

608
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:56,445
there's another flight
that leaves in five minutes.

609
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,130
You're getting on it.
I'm gonna try.

610
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,515
There is no try!

611
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:00,900
You're getting on that plane.

612
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,651
Hey, growth spurt.

613
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:05,637
If there is only one seat
left on this plane,

614
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,472
I will fight you for it.

615
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,474
And I'm a biter.

616
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,110
Marshall, whoever that is,
grab her carry-on

617
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:12,644
and throw it
into a restricted area.

618
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:14,330
I'm serious. Do it.
Do it now.

619
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:15,831
What? No.

620
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:16,916
Barney, are you...?

621
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,417
No, I'm not gonna...

622
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,501
That's... No.

623
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:21,670
There is no
"What, no, Barney, are you,

624
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:23,706
no I'm not gonna, that's no!"

625
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,824
This is a holiday weekend.

626
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:28,827
You're not gonna get
to New York by being nice.

627
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:31,263
So you're gonna have
to lose the whole Midwestern

628
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:32,831
aw-shucksy-doodles thing...

629
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,882
Shucksy doodles?

630
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:35,267
...and act like a New Yorker.

631
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:37,686
A pushy, obnoxious,
knock-the-other-guy-down-

632
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:40,222
and-take-his-hot-dog resident
of the greatest city on earth!

633
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:41,774
No can do, Barney.

634
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:42,942
I'm from Minnesota,

635
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:45,277
where there's plenty of hot dogs
for everyone.

636
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,348
Perhaps even too many.

637
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,366
But listen,

638
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:51,951
I'm gonna get to New York

639
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:53,285
without being a jerk.

640
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:55,020
Just get to New York!

641
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:56,021
I'll get to New York!

642
00:24:56,023 --> 00:24:57,606
Nobody's getting to New York.

643
00:24:57,608 --> 00:24:59,024
Not this weekend anyway.

644
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:01,660
There's a big storm
rolling up the East Coast.

645
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:03,579
All the airports
are closing.

646
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:06,365
My advice is
rent a car and drive.

647
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,466
But you better hurry.

648
00:25:07,468 --> 00:25:09,435
They're gonna
run out of cars soon.

649
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:10,819
(groans)

650
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,254
Okay, listen.

651
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:13,589
If we're both
going to New York,

652
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:16,809
why don't we rent a car,
split the drive?

653
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:18,594
That seems like
a reasonable plan.

654
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:20,896
Can I help you with
that diaper bag?

655
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,349
Sure. Thank you.
Oh, it's...

656
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:28,237
Have a nice bus ride,
pumpkin head!

657
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:34,276
(panting)

658
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:40,532
Hey, lady.

659
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:42,368
Yeah, you just threw away
your ticket

660
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,869
to a really great road trip.

661
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:46,205
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

662
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,340
You're all the way back there,

663
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:50,575
and I'm all the way
up here.

664
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:52,878
(laughing)
Oh, you can hear me.

665
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,464
Get ready to be driving
the jealous-mobile

666
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:57,599
because our car is
gonna have games,

667
00:25:57,601 --> 00:26:00,419
snacks, a James Patterson
audio book

668
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:04,289
my mother describes as
"cluttering her glove box."

669
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:07,359
Your car? I'll be in Pittsburgh
before you get your car.

670
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:09,978
We'll see about that.

671
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,947
And if you're going to New York,
you're not gonna want

672
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:13,032
to go through Pittsburgh.

673
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:14,433
94 backs up around Allentown,

674
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:16,869
so you're gonna want
to stick on 80.

Ma'am, it's not a race.

696
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:10,089
That right there
is why you lost.

697

I can. Give me the Monstrosity.

Do you have anything else?
I'll take the Monstrosity.

Give me the keys, old man!

Oh, my God--

00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:07,112
I don't care.

(groans)

725
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,432
Can I make a suggestion?

726
00:28:11,351 --> 00:28:12,601
I rent the car,

727
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:15,220
then I go buy the car seat,
come back here,

728
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:18,223
pick you guys up,
and then the three of us

729
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,958
drive to New York together.

730
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,827
(laughs quietly)

731
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:24,163
Let me get this straight.

732
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:26,565
So, you're gonna
rent the car,

733
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,535
go and get a baby seat
for my son,

734
00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:33,121
and then drive all the way
back here to pick me up.

735
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:34,389
That's right.

736
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:37,459
Well, then you're
gonna need some cash. Here.

737
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:39,428
Hundred bucks ought to cover it.

738
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,762
So, we'll see
you soon.

739
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:42,631
You got it, Michael!
Marshall.

740
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:45,050
Doesn't matter now, does it?

741
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:50,422
Remember this day, Marvin.

742
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:54,560
Not only is this the day
that we either saw Prince

743
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,980
or a... a really flamboyantly
dressed greyhound,

744
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:01,733
it's also the day that your dad
chose not to be a jerk...

745
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:04,386
and put his trust in humanity.

746
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:07,122
Just watch where it gets us.

747
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:12,211
Shucksy-doodles!

NARRATOR: <i>Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>was just about ready</i>

749
00:29:15,665 --> 00:29:17,147
<i>to abandon</i>
<i>his faith in humanity.</i>

750
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:19,838
But let's back up a little bit.

751
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,042
And now the true tale
of the Stinson Curse.

752
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:27,912
BARNEY:
<i>Moscow, 1807.</i>

753
00:29:27,914 --> 00:29:29,981
(Russian accent): What a wonderful night
at the opera.

754
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:31,950
Wouldn't you agree,
Comrade Barnovski?

755
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:34,402
(Russian accent): I would indeed,
Comrade Jamesokoff.

756
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:37,572
But you know what made it
truly wonderful?

757
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:40,175
Being here with my wife...

758
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:43,945
the beet in my borscht,
the fur on my hat,

759
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:49,033
the only person I've ever
been attracted to, ever.

760
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:51,219
I feel the same way
about Kyle...

761
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,304
my plutonic friend
from work.

762
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:55,056
(clattering)

763
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:58,777
Is it just me, or did that feel
like we hit an old Gypsy woman?

764
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:00,545
Yep. Old Gypsy woman.

765
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:03,314
Good call, Barnovski.
Oh, well, she's just a peasant.

766
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:04,299
Home, Smirnoff.

767
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,717
Wait, she's
saying somethink!

768
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,103
(low, deep moan)

769
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:09,938
Hornier.

770
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,658
Hornier.

771
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:15,994
Hornier?

772
00:30:15,996 --> 00:30:17,895
Sonobovich!

773
00:30:17,897 --> 00:30:20,014
Did she just put a curse on us?

774
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,583
Eh, nonsense, brother.

775
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:24,452
Okay, let's go, Smirnoff.

776
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:25,670
Smirnoff?

777
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:29,691
Homina, hominovich. Mmm,

778
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:34,395
Smirnoff, I would climb you
like the Kremlin Wall.

779
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:35,913
What's happening to me?

780
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:38,516
Don't you see?
You're getting hornier, brother,

781
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:41,136
just like
the old Gypsy woman said!

782
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:42,504
Oh, hello there.

783
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:47,642
(chuckles) Ever had
a White Russian?

784
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,763
BARNEY:
<i>For the next 200 years,</i>

785
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:55,433
<i>every male member</i>
<i>of the Stinson family</i>

786
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:58,536
<i>was afflicted</i>
<i>by the Gypsy's curse,</i>

787
00:30:58,538 --> 00:31:00,104
<i>an unquenchable thirst</i>
<i>for booty</i>

788
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:04,259
that no committed relationship
<i>could ever satisfy.</i>

789
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:06,544
That is, until my brother James

790
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:08,480
met his husband Tom.

791
00:31:08,482 --> 00:31:11,449
The day they got married,
they lifted the curse forever,

792
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:13,384
freeing me from the shackles

793
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:15,587
of having sex
with lots of different women.

794
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:16,588
Although, sometimes

795
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,389
Robin and I still use
the shackles.

796
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:19,340
Bondage five!

797
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:21,059
Whoa.
I can't, I can't,

798
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:21,976
I can't.

799
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:24,095
(phone rings)
Go for Barney!

800
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,781
Ah.

801
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:30,185
Thank you, Linus.

802
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:31,769
This is worse
than I thought.

803
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:33,638
I know.
Showtime, no HBO?

804
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,106
JAMES:
No.

805
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:38,493
Tom and I are getting divorced.

806
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:39,794
What?
TED: What?

807
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:42,163
That's why you look
extra handsome.

808
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,082
I do get extra hot
when I'm single.

809
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:45,099
Your skin looks amazing.

810
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:46,417
Looks amazing.
I know.

811
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:48,753
So... so what happened?
Why-why'd you guys break up?

812
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:50,338
Well, the thing to remember

813
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,873
is that when something
like this happens,

814
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:52,891
it's nobody's fault.

815
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:55,026
You cheated on him.
Repeatedly.

816
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,345
I thought about
keeping it quiet,

817
00:31:57,347 --> 00:32:00,465
but then I realized,
wouldn't my family want me

818
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:04,052
to be honest with them
about news this big?

819
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:07,522
Oh, can I just say five things?

820
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:12,777
What is the matter with--
sorry, six-- you?!

821
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,629
Ooh! What?!

822
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:17,365
I'm-I'm sorry
about you and Tom,

823
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,784
but you can't just drop
a bombshell like this

824
00:32:19,786 --> 00:32:21,302
so close to
someone's wedding.

825
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:23,972
You broke the curse.
You and Tom

826
00:32:23,974 --> 00:32:25,073
are the only couple

827
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:26,741
that makes Barney
believe in marriage.

828
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,077
(chuckles) Really?
The only couple?

829
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,297
I mean, no one else
comes to mind?

830
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:34,132
Been together 17 years?

831
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:36,867
She's a spunky redhead,
he's got calves

832
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:39,387
that launched a thousand
lady boners?

833
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,588
BARNEY:
Hey, sorry about that.

834
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,923
Hey, did you guys know

835
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:45,510
that Sunday is James' and Tom's
anniversary?

836
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:47,545
How cool is that?

837
00:32:47,547 --> 00:32:48,680
We're anniversary bros!

838
00:32:48,682 --> 00:32:50,548
Every year, we should go out
and celebrate...

839
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,849
just the two of us.

840
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,785
Listen, bro, you...

841
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:56,104
I know, I know, "Please, Barney,

842
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:59,357
you don't have to get us
an anniversary gift this year."

843
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,592
You get them an
anniversary gift?

844
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:02,110
Why shouldn't I?
They're the one couple

845
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:03,861
that makes me believe marriage
is possible.

846
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:05,896
I mean, I'm sitting right here.

847
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:08,449
Thank you, Linus.

848
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,201
JAMES:
Barney, the thing is...

849
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:13,621
Cover your ears and hum "The
Battle Hymn of the Republic""

850
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:14,806
Why?

851
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:17,358
It's for the bride.

852
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,843
Oh, it's for... (humming)

853
00:33:18,845 --> 00:33:20,044
Okay, listen, James,

854
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,713
my cousin Vince
is a Mountie.

855
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:24,432
His girlfriend is back home,
but he gets gay at weddings.

856
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:26,134
He's yours.
I am giving you Vince.

857
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:27,719
Just please,
don't tell Barney.

858
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,137
If he finds out
that the only

859
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,805
successful marriage
in his life is over...

860
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,106
I hate everyone
at this table.

861
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:33,107
...it'll spook him.

862
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,409
I don't want him
getting spooked.

863
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:36,544
Robin, have some faith.

864
00:33:36,546 --> 00:33:39,480
Do you really think what you
and Barney have is that fragile?

865
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:42,450
I don't want to find out.

866
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:44,118
Fine.

867
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:48,072
Thanks, baby.

868
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:49,574
No sweat.
Mmm...

869
00:33:49,576 --> 00:33:52,393
So, James, seriously,
where's Tom?

870
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:53,628
He can't make the wedding.

871
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,079
He had his wisdom teeth out.

872
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:56,447
Ugh! On top of a divorce?

873
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:57,665
That is rough.

874
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:00,401
Uh-oh.

875
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:03,471
What is she talking about?

876
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,741
Tom and I are getting a divorce.

877
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:11,846
Excuse me.

878
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:19,087
Vince... off the table.

879
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,741
What was that?
I don't know.

880
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:25,176
It just came out.

881
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:26,878
That's it.
It's barely even noon.

882
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,496
You're cut off.

883
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,198
Thank you, Linus.

884
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:32,834
Thank you, Linus.

885
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,486
Thank you, Linus.

886
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:37,988
Thank you, Linus.

887
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,507
Thank you, Linus.

888
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,592
Okay, but after that one,
you're cut off!

889
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,880
No! No, you are not doing this.
Step away from the desk.

890
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:46,964
What are you talking about?

891
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:48,599
You just found out
about James and Tom,

892
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:51,018
and it totally freaked you out,
and now you're asking this guy

893
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,186
to point you in the direction

894
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:53,404
of the nearest,
dirtiest strip club.

895
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:55,506
Oh, well,
that-that's a tough one.

896
00:34:55,508 --> 00:34:58,226
Uh, the nearest one
that's-that's kind of dirty

897
00:34:58,228 --> 00:34:59,794
is The Sand Box,

898
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:02,730
but the, uh...
the dirtiest one that's nearby

899
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:04,515
is The Crab Shed.

900
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:05,633
Dude.

901
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:08,236
Sorry. Uh, but hey,
if-if you do go,

902
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:10,204
maybe you could take Ted.

903
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:11,856
I'm really worried
about that kid.

904
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:15,710
No, Robin, I am not
going to a strip club.

905
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:16,978
Especially right now.

906
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,164
Could you imagine
the day shift at The Crab Shed?

907
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,084
Robin...

908
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,970
I came to the desk to get this.

909
00:35:25,972 --> 00:35:27,655
Is that the key to our room?

910
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:29,390
It's the key to James's room.

911
00:35:35,097 --> 00:35:36,431
Oh, my.

912
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:37,815
What is that?

913
00:35:37,817 --> 00:35:39,167
It's an erotic cake.

914
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:41,051
I wanted to surprise them
for their anniversary.

915
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,520
Is that... is that
James and Tom?

916
00:35:42,522 --> 00:35:46,407
Mmm, caramel marzipan,
chocolate marzipan.

917
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:47,975
I love chocolate
marzipan.

918
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:50,778
So does Tom.
Used to anyway.

919
00:35:51,997 --> 00:35:55,065
This is, uh, absolutely the,
uh... the weirdest thing

920
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,785
anyone has ever done
for their sibling.

921
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:01,405
I love you so much.

922
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,342
You thought I was
gonna freak out.

923
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:06,878
Well, I mean, a Gypsy
cursed your family

924
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,764
to become hornier and do
awesome guitar solos.

925
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:11,516
Can you blame me?

926
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:14,018
Look, am I bummed about James
and Tom getting a divorce?

927
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,138
Obviously.
But I don't need them

928
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,524
to make me believe
in true love anymore.

929
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:20,975
I've got you for that now.

930
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:22,777
Mmm.

931
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:26,247
Oh, man, now I gotta figure out
what to do with all this stuff.

932
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:28,399
Well, before we do that...

933
00:36:28,401 --> 00:36:31,452
um, would it be all
right if I nibbled

934
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:33,905
on your brother's
Ding Dong?

935
00:36:33,907 --> 00:36:36,574
How about we nibble

936
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:40,411
on my brother's
Ding Dong together?

937
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:42,296
I'd like that.

938
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:46,334
NARRATOR: So, they cleaned all that stuff
<i>out of there</i>

939
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,002
<i>and had a talk with James.</i>

940
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:51,506
<i>And Barney didn't freak out,</i>
because here's the thing, kids.

941
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:55,560
<i>When you believe in people,</i>
<i>people come through.</i>

942
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:03,251
Just so we're clear,
I pick the music.

943
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:04,535
Of course.

944
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:05,520
Say it.

945
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,255
Say, "Daphne picks the music."

946
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:09,073
Daphne picks the music.

947
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:10,241
And you pay for gas.

948
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:11,993
Are you kidding?
Do you have any idea

949
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:13,227
how much gas this thing takes?

950
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:14,428
(engine revs)
No, no, okay!

951
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,763
Okay, I pay for gas.

952
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,331
Good. Now, get in.

953
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,149
It's a long ride to Phoenix.

954
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:20,718
Say what?

955
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,087
(laughs)
I'm just kidding.

956
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:25,206
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

957
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:31,846
This must be the singles table.

958
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:35,516
(chuckles)
Guess it is.

959
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:39,203
Well, it's kind of nice
to be asking this question

960
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:40,688
instead of answering it
for a change:

961
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,756
How are you doing?

962
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,674
I don't know.

963
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,277
I'm trying to be happy
for my brother,

964
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:48,012
but, uh... I guess a person

965
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:49,897
has a different
perspective on weddings

966
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:53,334
when he knows what's down there
at the end of the aisle.

967
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:56,437
It's not all
champagne and frosting.

968
00:37:57,406 --> 00:38:00,524
Mr. Stinson, your room is ready.

969
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:02,310
And, Ted...

970
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:04,495
she's right around the corner.

971
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:06,080
Thank you, Curtis.

972
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:07,882
I feel it, too.

973
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:09,417
No, no, no, the-the housekeeper.

974
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:11,502
She's in the room that's right
around the corner from yours.

975
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:12,670
Oh.
So another hour, tops.

976
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,922
Sure.

977
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:16,507
Okay, see you later, Ted.

978
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,175
You're not
giving up, James.

979
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,078
And neither am I.

980
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:37,295
(footsteps approach)

981
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:38,362
TED:
Hey, beautiful.

982
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:39,347
Hi.

983
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,332
God, you look great.

984
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:43,217
What? Come on.

985
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:44,268
You do!

986
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,087
I've been in a car all morning.

987
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:49,440
I just ate a croissant crumb
that I found in my bra.

988
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:50,758
I'm disgusting.

989
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,678
Yeah, I saw you do that.
And it was super hot. Come here.

990
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,346
(chuckles) You come here.
Come here.

991
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:58,215
No, you come here.
Come here.

992
00:38:58,217 --> 00:38:59,917
Hey, you want to hear
something funny?

993
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:00,935
Mm-hmm.

994
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:03,270
One year ago today,
almost to the minute,

995
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:05,589
I was sitting
at this very table

996
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:07,058
right in that seat.

997
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:10,394
Oh, yeah. I can see it.

998
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,863
Nursing your gin and tonic
with three extra limes,

999
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:14,682
doing the crossword,

1000
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:17,267
probably being
all showboat-y about it.

1001
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:18,169
I wasn't being
showboat-y about it.

1002
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:21,205
"Vesuvius""
Boo-yah!

1003
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:24,959
Oh, wait, that doesn't fit.

1004
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:27,261
The point is,
one year ago today,

1005
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:30,831
I made a promise to myself
right at this table.

1006
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,900
THE MOTHER:
What was the promise?

1007
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:37,438
BOTH TEDS: I'm coming back,
and I'm bringing you.

1008
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,407
Wait a second.
Hold it.

1009
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,677
One year ago today,
you hadn't even met me.

1010
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,845
I know, but I knew I would.

1011
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,648
And now it's a year later.

1012
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,316
And here I am.

1013
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:50,668
Here you are.

1014
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,103
Love in your eyes,

1015
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:53,988
baked goods
in your undergarments.

1016
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,022
Yeah.

1017
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:57,291
You picked a real winner, Mosby.

1018
00:39:57,293 --> 00:40:00,044
I did.

1019
00:40:01,513 --> 00:40:03,330
Okay, seriously, what the crap

1020
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:05,349
is taking so long
with these rooms?

1021
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:07,284
It was like this
last year.

1022
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,003
I'll be right back.

1023
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:11,372
I'll be right here.

1024
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:30,395
Sorry that took so long.

1025
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,361
Please...

1026
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,196
try to enjoy your stay.

1027
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,165
I will.

1028
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,315
Try to.

1029
00:40:37,317 --> 00:40:41,036
I will enjoy my stay.

1030
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,153
Try.

1031
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:43,789
Not gonna try.

1032
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:46,959
Just... just gonna do it.

1033
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:47,993
Good for you.

1034
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:49,011
Not good for me.

1035
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,397
No, just-just neutral for me.

1036
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:55,050
Attaboy.
No, at not a boy.

1037
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,854
It gets better.

1038
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,273
I am fine, Curtis. Okay?

1039
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:04,393
I enjoy and appreciate
the happiness of other people

1040
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,130
whether I am in a relationship
or not. Okay? Curtis?

1041
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,314
So just-just...

1042
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:11,783
just go ahead
and give me my one key

1043
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:13,819
because I am fine.

1044
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,988
Oh, come on!
I need another drink.
