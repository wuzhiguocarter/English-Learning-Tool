Well, almost
the whole gang.

00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,573
Yeah, there's just one beloved
piece of the puzzle missing.

29

That bottle of 30-year
Glen McKenna scotch.

<i>intended</i>
<i>for a special wedding toast.</i>

35
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:44,057
Also, where the
hell is Marshall?

36
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:47,794
I still can't believe he took
the judgeship behind my back.

37
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:51,431
Look, I know this is messy, my
dream versus Marshall's dream.

38
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,717
I won't force you guys
to choose sides.

39
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,736
Good, because I totally side
with Marshall.

40
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:58,355
That would've been so awkward.

41
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:00,657
Hey, let's go see if they have
any Glen McKenna up at the bar.

42
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,975
Okay.

43
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:03,577
Hey, look, don't be mad.

44
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,245
Barney just thinks
that if he has a judge friend,

45
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:08,615
he can get all of his citations
for public urination thrown out.

46
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:10,834
How often does Barney pee
in public?

47
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,287
A lot.

48
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,838
But don't worry.

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,123

00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,257

And which one of us is he gonna
<i>try to make the sex on?</i>

54
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:28,218
You both look beautiful tonight.

55
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,520
<i>Bro, going for the tricycle.</i>

00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:34,841
<i>Can you imagine having</i>
<i>a three-way with this creep?</i>

57
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,176
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

58
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:37,844
<i>You, me and this guy,</i>

<i>That'd be so stupid.</i>

00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:48,655
<i>So stupid...</i>

63
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:50,857
Um, okay, I'll shoot him down.

64
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,161
By the way, I am so psyched
for the wedding tomorrow, Robin.

65
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,996
I'm truly honored
that you and Barney

66
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:57,331

68
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:01,534
you're here...

69
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,554
...valued invitee.

70
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:07,224
<i>Help me. Who is this?</i>

71
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:10,344
<i>Maybe he's one of your</i>
<i>long-lost Canadian cousins?</i>

72
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:14,147
Uh, do you happen to have all
of your fingers and teeth?

73
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:16,650
Uh... yeah.

74
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:18,551
<i>Not one of my cousins.</i>

75
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:21,905
Hey, thanks again
for picking us up.

76
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:23,824
It's been a crazy
couple of days.

77
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,692
You can't imagine
what we've been through.

78
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:26,827
Wait, let me guess.

79
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,830
You were visiting a relative,

80
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,682
maybe... your mother?

81
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:32,783
And I'm getting

82
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:34,234
a Midwest vibe,

83
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:35,936
somewhere like...
Wisconsin...

84
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:37,254
...no, Minnesota?

85
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:38,822
Wow.

86
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:40,874
You're-you're, like,
really good at this.

87
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:43,576
You're planning an overseas trip
with your wife.

88
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,545
I'm seeing a...

89
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,747
a feisty redhead who loves art.

90
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:48,765
She just got a job

91
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,183
in Europe, maybe France?

92
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:51,584
No. Italy?

93
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:55,689
Total shot in the dark, but...

94
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:56,890
Rome?

95
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,695
Maybe I'll just, like...

96
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:02,929
I'll get out right here.

97
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:06,116
You're not going anywhere.

98
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,902
No, I'm just messin' with ya.

99
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,370
I rode the train with your wife.

100
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:11,872
She told me all about you.

101
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,073
You must be Marshall.

102
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:19,296
Um...

103
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:20,664
I was checking on the baby.

104
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:23,950
Wait-wait a minute,
wait a minute.

105
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:25,886
So you guys both got locked out

106
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:28,055
on the roof in your pajamas?

107
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:31,791
You guys are hilarious
and adorable!

108
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,793
<i>Any idea who this guy is?</i>

109
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,645
<i>No, but I like that he gets</i>

110
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,065
<i>how hilarious</i>
<i>and adorable we are!</i>

111
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,233
We are <i>hilarious and adorable!</i>

112
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:41,985
I'll get the next round.

113
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:43,403
Oh, thanks.

114
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:44,771
Thanks, Lil.

115
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:48,241
Hey, I'm sorry if
I barged in on you guys.

116
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:49,776
I can be a little overeager

117
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:51,778
to connect sometimes.

118
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Probably because of
my childhood.

119
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:55,198
Right.

120
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,584
Because of that thing
that happened.

121
00:04:57,586 --> 00:04:59,319
My mother died
on a hunting trip

122
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:01,488
when I was very young.

123
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,874
Yeah, that's it,
that's the thing.

124
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:05,876
Sorry, blah, too heavy!

125
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,878
So, Robin.

126
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,212
What's going on...

127
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:10,764
with you?

128
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,299
Oh, nothing.

129
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:14,134
I mean, uh, nothing big, anyway.

130
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:15,519
Hey, hey, hey...

131
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,004
this is me
you're talking to.

132
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:21,525
Well, there is
this thing with Lily...

133
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,059
You know, Ted,

134
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,778
if you really want
to get a bottle

135
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,696
of Glen McKenna 30-year
for Barney,

136
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:29,349
I got that last one at
the Farhampton Liquor Store.

137
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,618
The security there
is a total joke!

138
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,620
No, see, I don't
want to know that.

139
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:36,123
I won't be an accomplice
to grand larceny.

140
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,691
I am not confirming
or denying a thing.

141
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,710
But there's a really high window
in the storage room

142
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:42,028
and if you climb up...

143
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,914
La la la la la,
I'm not listening!

144
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,215
I love Barney,

145
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,666
but I'm not going
to jail for him.

146
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,051
What? Really?
Why not?

147
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:49,202
I'd go to jail for you.

148
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:50,804
No, you wouldn't.
Yes, I would.

149
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,005
Going to jail for
your best friend?

150
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,056
That's the dream.

151
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:54,207
Really?

152
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,475
That's the dream?

153
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:58,762
Yeah, it's the most noble--
nay, bro-ble--

154
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:00,481
thing a bro can do
for a fellow bro.

155
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:01,048
Mm-hmm.

156
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:03,567
So yes, Ted, that's the dream.

157
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,019
You're too liberal with the phrase
"That's the dream."

158
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,571
Name one other time
I've said that!

159
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:09,823
A suit made of prosciutto
so you can eat your way naked,

160
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:10,874
"That's the dream."

161
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,076
A pack of lions
fighting a tyrannosaurus,

162
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,194
"That's the dream."

163
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:15,162
Being able to take

164
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:16,413
a whole year's
worth of dumps

165
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:17,998
in one, nonstop
24-hour period

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,166
then not having
to dump again

167
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:20,116
for the rest
of the year,

168
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,418
"That's the dream."

169
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,903
I never said Dump Day
was the dream.

170
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:26,373
I said science is
this close to a pill.

171
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,408
There can only be
one "the dream"!

172
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,577
You're saying it's going
to jail for a bro?

173
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,761
You're comfortable
with that being

174
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:33,547
the one and only
dream, forever?

175
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:35,549
Yes.

176
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:37,917
Great, now you can never
use that phrase again.

177
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,919
And for me,
that's the dream.

178
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,389
Hey, Lily, Robin just
told me about Italy!

179
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,924
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be great.

180
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:47,360
Well, that is, if I can
convince my husband

181
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:49,229
to keep his promise
and move there with me.

182
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,647
Robin, I know

183
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,482
you told me you want
Marshall to win,

184
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:53,433
but I don't know.

185
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:55,452
I gotta side
with Lily on this one.

186
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:56,620
Later, skaters.

187
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,826
Thanks again
for saving us.

188
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:04,777
Well, I don't normally
stop like that,

189
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:07,780
but I just had to for the cutest
hitchhiker in the world!

190
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:09,966
Thank you.

191
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:11,885
Oh, you were talking
about Marvin.

192
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:15,055
Sorry, it's been
a really, really long day.

193
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:16,840
When we get there,
I'll buy you a drink.

194
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:19,959
Thank you,
but, um, after I drop you off,

195
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,262
I'm heading back to the city.

196
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:23,346
What?
I thought you said that

197
00:07:23,348 --> 00:07:24,397
your-your band's
playing the wedding.

198
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,432
Why are you leaving?

199
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:26,633
The lead singer.

200
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:27,734
He's the devil.

201
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:29,185
He's a total fire-starter.

202
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,320
He just ruins
people's lives

203
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:31,855
for his own amusement.

204
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:33,806
You know, he will walk
up to two friends,

205
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:35,525
he will find the one thing

206
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:38,662
that will destroy their
friendship and just-- poof!--

207
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,330
burn it to the ground.

208
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,615
Wow.

209
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:42,916
What's his name?

210
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:45,835
What's poppin',
mi amigos?

211
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:47,504
<i>Darren.</i>

212
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,385
You're rooting
for Marshall?!

213
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,336
Well, why don't you just get

214
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:55,537
a Team Marshall T-shirt?

215
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:56,539
What size are you?

216
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,573
Extra-traitor?

217
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,408
No. No, okay...

218
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,527
What I said was...

219
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,429
See, all I meant was...

220
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:04,763
God, how did we get here?

221
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:07,099
That's the question
you're left asking yourself.

222
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:08,751
So here's how
he does it:

223
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:11,403
First, he makes you
feel like you are

224
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:12,738
the most hilarious

225
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,057
and adorable person
in the world...

226
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,575
You guys are
hilarious

227
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:17,776
and adorable!

228
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:19,394
<i>I like that he gets</i>

229
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,497
<i>how hilarious</i>
<i>and adorable we are.</i>

230
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,833
We are <i>hilarious and adorable.</i>

231
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:27,569
Next, he finds some flimsy
connection with you

232
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:28,821
based on where you're from...

233
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:29,922
Cleveland?
Yeah.

234
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:31,590
Galluci's serves the

235
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:32,791
best pepperoni bread!
Best pepperoni bread!

236
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,510
And Staten Island!

237
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:37,012
Guys getting in fights
on their front lawns!

238
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:38,848
It's like you're
from there!

239
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,218
<i>This guy's awesome!</i>

240
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,853
<i>So awesome!</i>

241
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,521
I'd totally go to jail for him.

242
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:48,090
<i>That hurts.</i>

243
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:51,610
Next, he tells you
a "deep personal secret"

244
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:53,262
that is usually
the tragic back-story

245
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:54,563
from an animated kid's film.

246
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:57,149
My mother died on
a hunting trip.

247
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:58,651
It's often <i>Bambi.</i>

248
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:01,070
My father was
betrayed and killed

249
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:03,072
by a trusted advisor.

250
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,791
Sometimes he'll throw a little
<i>Lion King</i> in there.

251
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:07,877
I have no family.

252
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,662
But tonight...

253
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,613
I think maybe
I found two brothers.

254
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,384
Sorry, blah, too heavy.

255
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:16,552
That's okay, man.

256
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,337
Let me get you a drink.

257
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,289
<i>And then, once</i>
<i>your guard is down,</i>

258
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,125
<i>the emotional</i>
<i>prostate exam begins...</i>

259
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:24,059
So, Ted,

260
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,628
what's going on...
with you?

261
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,765
Well... I mean,
there was this thing...

262
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,133
Never mind.

263
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,568
Hey, hey, hey...

264
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,737
This is me you're talking to.

265
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,473
Look, all I meant

266
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:40,475
was that there are
two sides here.

267
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:41,443
Yes,

268
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:43,279
Italy is your dream,

269
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,813
but being a judge is Marshall's.

270
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:45,831
Well, that

271
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,865
and teaching prop comedy

272
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:47,866
to a tropical bird.

273
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:50,452
Parrot Top has nothing
to do with this!

274
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:52,371
I don't need
objectivity.

275
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:55,374
You're my best friend,
I just need your support.

276
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,042
I understand.
You got it.

277
00:09:57,044 --> 00:09:58,427
I'm sorry.

278
00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,494
Oh, me, too.

279
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:00,846
Forgot my phone.

280
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:02,998
I'm sorry, you guys are probably
talking wedding details.

281
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,850
I mean, no maid of honor's
gonna steal the spotlight

282
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:06,018
with her own problem

283
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,303
on the bride's big weekend,
am I right?

284
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,021
Keep it real, homies!

285
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,275
You know, he is right.

286
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:15,110
Why is this all about you?

287
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:16,395
I mean, you have
been preoccupied

288
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:17,646
with Marshall all weekend.

289
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:18,948
I have not!

290
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,016
You have been sleeping
with a doll made of cushions

291
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:22,351
that you named after him.

292
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:23,685
Not true!

293
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:24,737
After we do our business,

294
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:26,405
I make Marshpillow
sleep on the couch!

295
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,690
So there!
Oh, my God, that is so ridiculous!

296
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:29,842
So, what did Darren
do to you?

297
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:32,411
Well, a few years ago,
I started this band.

298
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:33,996
And, you know, it was a goof--

299
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:37,249
it was just me and a couple
of dorks from business school.

300
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:39,868
I'm actually embarrassed
to tell you our name.

301
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,337
I had an all-lawyer funk band

302
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,806
called The Funk, The Whole Funk,
And Nothing But The Funk.

303
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,392
Oh, I now feel very safe
talking about <i>my</i> band--

304
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:47,593
Super-Freak-Onomics.

305
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,478
Nice.
 Anyway,

306
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,981
I brought Darren in
to split lead vocals,

307
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,399
and he took over.

308
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,317
You know, first
he took away my solos,

309
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,019
then I got demoted
to backup vocals,

310
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,271
and now the only time
I use a mic

311
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:02,074
is after Darren's first
false exit, when I say,

312
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:04,109
"Do you guys want more Darren?"

313
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,361
And then today,

314
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,280
I found this
ad online.

315
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,732
"Ass player wanted"?

316
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:11,583
Move your thumb.

317
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:13,502
Oh, <i>"bass</i> player wanted."

318
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:16,121
Wait, he was gonna kick you
out of your own band?

319
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,456
Yeah.

320
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,542
But instead...I quit.

321
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:22,577
You quit?! That's it?

322
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:25,014
But it's your band--
you must be avenged!

323
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:26,548
Funny you should say that,

324
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,802
because as I was leaving
the hotel, I ran into someone.

325
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:33,639
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

326
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:36,025
Aldrin Justice, nice!

327
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,926
Your wife is cool.

328
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:40,029
Oh, the coolest.

329
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:42,597
Hey, did she, um,
happen to mention

330
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,099
the fact
that I'm sort of ruining

331
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,567
her dream of moving to Italy?

332
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,353
Uh, yeah, that did come up.

333
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,740
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

334
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,775
And then run

335
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:56,045
my husband over with it.

336
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,497
I think you've got
a tough talk coming.

337
00:11:58,499 --> 00:11:59,965
Yeah, well, so do you.

338
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:01,917
When we get
to the Farhampton Inn,

339
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,785
you're gonna go in there and
you're gonna stand up to Darren.

340
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:06,422
Oh, come on,
I Aldrin Justiced him.

341
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:07,956
Yeah, but I bet
you're just gonna give

342
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,758
this van right back to him.

343
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,777
I mean, were you at least
gonna pee in it a little?

344
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:15,564
I was gonna gas it up
and get it washed.

345
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,266
You're too nice.

346
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,901
I'm the same way.

347
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,769
Sometimes you got
to get in there

348
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:21,904
and-and stand up for yourself.

349
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:24,823
I always cave and side
with the other person.

350
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,742
I can't handle confrontation.

351
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:27,809
Yes, you can.

352
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:29,278
You make some good points.

353
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,163
Look.

354
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:34,099
I don't know you, but I can tell
that you're strong.

355
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,502
That's your band.

356
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:38,871
Don't let Darren steal it away.

357
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,092
No, there's
no defeating the devil.

358
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:45,660
He's someone else's problem now.

359
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:48,163
I'm sorry
if I've been

360
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,515
distracted this weekend.

361
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,850
Oh, let's not fight anymore,
okay?

362
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,520
Oh, good, Robin,
you finally told Lily

363
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:55,888
you feel like she's
abandoning you as a friend

364
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,839
by going to Italy.

365
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,892
Honesty is progress.
Stay gold.

366
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,311
I'm not...

367
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,779
Ooh, Ted.

368
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:04,781
When you move to Chicago,

369
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,366
you got to try Gazzola's pizza.

370
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:08,683
Namaste, hermanos.

371
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,624
You're moving to Chicago?

372
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:19,532
Is that even a real place?

373
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,068
It's a style of pizza.

374
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,869
Ted, you can't live in a pizza.

375
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,921
I got an amazing
job offer there.

376
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,274
Look, Lily knows,
but Marshall and Robin don't.

377
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:28,608
So please keep it quiet.

378
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,895
You're moving to Chicago?!

379
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:35,381
He-he's moving to Chicago!

380
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:36,767
When do you move?

381
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,436
At least tell me it's not
until next year or something.

382
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:42,405
It's not until...

383
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,556
Monday.

384
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,859
Monday?!

385
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:49,362
So you are just gonna disappear
the day after my wedding?

386
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:52,165
After ten years
of being best friends?

387
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,769
Well, actually, Marshall's my...
Don't even think about it!

388
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,559
That's fair enough.

389
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,782
You are gonna give me
one day's notice?

390
00:13:57,256 --> 00:14:00,073
Well, I didn't want to upset you
on your wedding weekend.

391
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:01,458
No, it's good.

392
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,592
It'll be easy to say good-bye

393
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,511
now that I know how much
I mean to you.

394
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:06,930
Well...

395
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,435
Hey.

396
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:14,304
Hey.

397
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:15,722
Look, I was...

398
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,058
I was never really
rooting for Marshall.

399
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,144
I was rooting
to not lose my best friend.

400
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:23,930
But that's selfish.

401
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:25,565
No matter where you go,

402
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,818
I'm in your corner
and I always will be.

403
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:29,820
And to prove it...

404
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,442
What are you gonna do
with Marshpillow?

405
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:37,627
Hold his arms back

406
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:40,113
while you beat the goose down
out of this bastard.

407
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:42,799
Because that's
what best friends do.

408
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,668
Thanks, it-it's not gonna help.

409
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,253
Try it. One punch.

410
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,641
Ooh, that felt good.

411
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:52,843
Mm-hmm.

412
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:54,127
Yeah, that's it, sweetheart.

413
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:57,630
Head, body, head.
Head, body, head.

414
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,985
Barney, wait, wait!

415
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,403
Your friendship is
important to me.

416
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:04,938
I swear on my mother's...

417
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,306
No, I swear to God.

418
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:08,074
No... I swear to Hef.

419
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,493
Don't take that name in vain.

420
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:14,281
If someone is important to you,
you tell them you're moving.

421
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:17,751
I'm just some guy you
used to know back in New York.

422
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,502
Hey.

423
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,790
Whoa.

424
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,292
How...?

425
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,135
That's a $600 bottle.

426
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:37,337
Ted, that's grand larceny.

427
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,306
You really could go
to jail for this.

428
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:42,392
That's the dream.

429
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:44,895
So...

430
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:46,663
you're moving to Chicago.

431
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:49,182
I'm going to Chicago.

432
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,984
Why? I know
Marshall and Lily might leave,

433
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,852
but it's only a year,
and in the meantime,

434
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,537
we'll still see each other
all the time.

435
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,906
You, me, Robin...

436
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,460
Oh.

437
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,881
I need a new start.

438
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,368
I'm gonna miss you.

439
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,387
I'm gonna miss you so much.

440
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,092
Well, here we are.

441
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:17,227
Good luck in there.

442
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:18,428
Thank you.

443
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,046
And don't worry,

444
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,348
at the reception, I'll yell,

445
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,600
"The lead singer
sucks skunk junk,"

446
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:24,901
after every song.

447
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:26,886
I'll come up with something

448
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,521
better than "skunk junk."

449
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:29,489
No, no.

450
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:31,875
"Skunk junk" is pretty solid.

451
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,246
You can't yell that
at the lead singer.

452
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:39,582
Because I don't suck skunk junk.

453
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,284
Wait, are you saying...?

454
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:43,787
I'm coming in. Darren and I
are gonna have a chat

455
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,672
about <i>my</i> band!

456
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,376
Skunk junk.

457
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:55,432
For the record...
Uh-huh.

458
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,384
his first word

459
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:59,135
was "Mommy."

460
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,337
Mm-hmm.

461
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,189
This is my band. I started it.

462
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:06,977
And if anyone is getting
fired here, it's you, Darren.

463
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,445
So hit the bricks,

464
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,196
s-skunk...

465
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,032
junk.

466
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,384
Is that even
a little bit intimidating?

467
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:16,703
Nope, and the
knitting's not helping.

468
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:19,706
I'm sorry, I just met this baby
and he needs a hat.

469
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,708
What...
You can't fire Darren.

470
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,711
He gets how hilarious
and adorable I am.

471
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:27,080
Plus it is so inspiring

472
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:30,834
how he overcame his mother
being eaten by a barracuda.

473
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,886
Gah! It's <i>Finding Nemo.</i>

474
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,472
That's new.

475
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,392
There's no defeating the devil.

476
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:41,461
New plan.
Linus, if at any point

477
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,463
tonight you see me
with an empty glass...

478
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:44,630
Kennedy package.

479
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:46,349
It's a very popular
choice this weekend.

480
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:48,234
Thank you, Linus.

481
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,470
Yup.

482
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:54,240
Uh, Lily?

483
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:56,309
Lily.

484
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:57,911
Lily.

485
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:12,008
Pause?

486
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,344
Pause.

487
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:19,265
Hi.

488
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,505
Thank you, Linus.

489
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:27,390
Mm-hmm.

490
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:30,009
There are real villains
in this world.

491
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:33,947
But they don't always get
real justice, do they?

492
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,583
You want to believe
karma's gonna get them.

493
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:38,017
All right, who wants a drink?

494
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,069
I'm stealing.

495
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,623
But karma doesn't

496
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
always come through.

497
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,077
I love how strong
your marriage is.

498
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,578
And you don't need
to lose weight, Louise,

499
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,196
no matter what he told me.

500
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:52,298
Catch you on the flip-flop,
muchachos.

501
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,167
Oh!

502
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:57,170
Sorry, <i>mi amigos.</i>

503
00:18:57,172 --> 00:19:00,540
I guess you have to accept
that sometimes in life...

504
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,010
...you just don't get that
knockout punch.

505
00:19:12,437 --> 00:19:13,886
Hey, can I get some ice?

506
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:16,573
The best man just punched me
in the face for no reason.

507
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,526
Oh, what, that's funny to you?

508
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,726
You know what? I quit.

509
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,545
You can have
your stupid band back.

510
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:26,616
I miss being in a band where
people are decent to each other

511
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:28,168
and there's no drama.

512
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,420
I'm going back
to the new Guns N' Roses.

513
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,740
Linus, whoever that best man is,

514
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:38,011
I would like to buy him a double

00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:28,482
Hey, Barney, I'm so sorry
I missed your rehearsal dinner.

537
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,424
Oh, that's okay.

538
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:33,861
We didn't even know
you weren't here, jerk.

539
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,780
Listen, I know that I can't
make up for being late,

540
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:37,732
but I did get you
a-a special gift.

541
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,651
Well, hand it over, fathead.

542
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,703
Well, you might want to wait
until after the wedding photos.

543
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:44,322
Hand it over now, travel breath.

544
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:46,574
Okay, Barney, I'll hand it over.

545
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,793
Oh, God, it's the fourth slap!

546
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:50,411
I don't know why
I was so obnoxious.
