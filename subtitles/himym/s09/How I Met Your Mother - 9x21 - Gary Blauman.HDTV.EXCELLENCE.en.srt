1
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:09,008
Hi.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,743
Hi.

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,111
Okay.

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,416
So I thought we'd...
try this new restaurant.

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,018
It's right around
the corner from here.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,686
It's Scottish-Mexican fusion.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,088
Scottish-Mexican fusion?

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,689
Scottish-Mexican fusion.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,192
That would seem like two things
that do not fuse.

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,793
Perhaps you'll change
your mind when you try

11
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,362
their signature
haggis enchiladas.

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,730
Okay.

13
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,466
All right. Yeah, come on.
Lead the way.

14
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,302
I was surprised
when you called.

15
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,670
Isn't there some
universal guy rule

16
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,239
where you have to wait
four days to call a girl?

17
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,274
That... does not ring a bell.

18
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,609
And it's three days.

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,278
Here we are.

20
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,117
Uh, I did not realize
there would be live music.

21
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,452
So, uh, should we...

22
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,620
Eat anywhere but here?

23
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,288
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,957
Besides, I'm sure
we can find a place

25
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,125
where we don't need
reservations.

26
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,593
Oh, you think
it's just that easy?

27
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,828
Just stroll in off the
street and get a meal?

28
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,766
Well, let me tell you
the tale of Gary Blauman.

29
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,300
There's the blushing bride!

30
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,802
Oh!

31
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,103
Gary Blauman!

32
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,638
How are you?!

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,573
Uh, duh, like I need to ask.

34
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,875
You're getting married.

35
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,177
Well, don't let me keep you.
You have things to do.

36
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,913
I will see you
walking down the aisle.

37
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,550
I'll be the guy in the
eighth row going like this.

38
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,119
Right?!
Right.

39
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,421
Good luck today!
Thank you.

40
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,055
Okay.

41
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,458
Hey, there's the
blushing bride...

42
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,759
Code red!

43
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,762

45
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,774
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,

46
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,209
oh, my God!
Why the code red?

47
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,344
I mean, if it's...
if it's about your hair,

48
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,447
I didn't even notice;
especially not from the back.

49
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,649
What?
Nothing.

50
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,684
Gary Blauman is here,
and I had no idea he was coming.

51
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,419
His reply card must've
gotten lost in the mail.

52
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,620
I mean,
where's he gonna sit?

53
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,923
It took us weeks to plan
the seating chart!

54
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,891
Robin.

55
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,159
Shh.

56
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:10,962
I got you.
Huh?

57
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,897
You're talking to
the seating chart master.

58
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,700
At my own wedding, I managed
to sit small-town Minnesotans

59
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,604
right next to liberal New
Yorkers with grace <i>and</i> aplomb.

60
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,707
Table 27 still gets together
once a year for a reunion.

61
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,176
Perhaps you've seen their photos
on Facebook.

62
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,580
Like I said...

63
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,981
I got you.

64
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,182
Thanks, Marshall.

65
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,989
Code red!

66
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,591
Grandma's sitting
next to the band,

67
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,926
divorced couple sitting one
table away from each other,

68
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,028
no coherent
singles table.

69
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,331
This is the Robin's hair
of seating charts.

70
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,333
Singles tables are cruel.

71
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,900
I mean, what if you went
to a wedding

72
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,502
and there was a table
of all fat guys?

73
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,270
That would be awesome.
You're right, it would.

74
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,771
Let's crack this
Gary Blauman nut first,

75
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,673
and then we'll work
on the fat guy table.

76
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,842
Wait, did you say Gary Blauman?

77
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,744
Yeah. Why?

78
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,214
I... hate... that guy.

79
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,282
Why?

80
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,583
Remember a few years ago

81
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,585
when I read that biography
of Teddy Roosevelt?

82
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,187
<i>For weeks after I read it,</i>

83
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,323
<i>I only wanted to talk</i>
<i>about one thing.</i>

84
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,560
Teddy Roosevelt was
the coolest guy ever!

85
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,863
Oh, that's it!
No more books, Ted.

86
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,533
I don't like the person
you become when you read books.

87
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,701
Here's the deal: you
get to tell us one more

88
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,004
interesting fact
about Teddy Roosevelt.

89
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,473
One more, and then
you're done forever.

90
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,941
So make it a good one.

91
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,243
Okay.

92
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,846
He went blind in one eye...

93
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,615
from getting hit too hard
in a boxing match...

94
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,151
...while he was president!

95
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,419
That's a pretty good one.
Wow.

96
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,487
That is kind of...

97
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,988
Right?! Oh, and when he was
at Harvard...

98
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,890
No! No! Shut up!
Oh, my God! Please!

99
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,992
<i>Well, one night,</i>
<i>we were throwing a party</i>

100
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,562
<i>to celebrate... something--</i>

101
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,096
<i>I-I can't remember what--</i>

102
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,065
<i>when a pretty girl</i>
<i>I had never met</i>

103
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,733
<i>noticed the book</i>
<i>on the coffee table.</i>

104
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,702
I can't believe
you have this book.

105
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,903
I just finished
reading it.

106
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,473
Teddy Roosevelt was
the coolest guy ever.

107
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,509
A unicorn.

108
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,743
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

109
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,312
It was a stroke of luck on par

110
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,781
<i>with the 50-page manuscript</i>
<i>in Roosevelt's breast pocket</i>

111
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,083
<i>that helped slow that</i>
<i>would-be assassin's bullet.</i>

112
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,917
Dude, come on.

113
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,519
Sorry. Anyway...

114
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,088
enter Gary Blauman.

115
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,624
Is that the Teddy
Roosevelt biography?

116
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,426
Coolest guy ever.

117
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,661
Right? Right?

118
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,196
Right? Right?

119
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,999
Right? Right?
Right?

120
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>So the three of us started</i>
<i>talking Teddy Roosevelt.</i>

121
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,370
When he took that
four-minute flight

122
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,605
on the Wright
brother's plane?

123
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,772
So cool.

124
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,641
The time he climbed
the tallest mountain

125
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,443
in Europe on
his honeymoon.

126
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,644
So cool.

127
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,212
<i>And that's when I realized,</i>

128
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,314
<i>Blauman and I were locked</i>
<i>in a battle of wills</i>

129
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,516
<i>that made T.R.'s charge</i>
<i>up San Juan Hill</i>

130
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,018
<i>look like a walk in the park.</i>

131
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,220
<i>Or should I say,</i>
<i>in the national park,</i>

132
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,254
<i>since it was Roosevelt</i>

133
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,756
<i>who spearheaded</i>
<i>the establishment...</i>

134
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,758
Dude, come on. I gave you one.

135
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,661
The battle raged on.

136
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,630
In a way, he was...

137
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,700
...the archetype
of the modern politician!

138
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,203
<i>Dude, knock it off.</i>

139
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,938
<i>Knock what off, bro?</i>

140
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,039
<i>This is my apartment,</i>

141
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,140
<i>my Teddy Roosevelt</i>
<i>conversation,</i>

142
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,508
<i>I get the girl.</i>

143
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,977
<i>Oh, so the fact that</i>
<i>you're the incumbent means</i>

144
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,112
<i>she should just pick you?</i>

145
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,147
<i>Tell that</i>
<i>to William Howard Taft.</i>

146
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,716
<i>You're calling me Taft?</i>

147
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,518
If anyone's Taft, you're Taft!

148
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,387
<i>I'm not Taft! I'm Teddy!</i>

149
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,422
<i>The hell you are.</i>
<i>My name is Ted!</i>

150
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,659
<i>Yeah, right. Go sign the</i>
<i>Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act, Taft!</i>

151
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,927
<i>How dare you?</i>

152
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,797
Skinny-dipping
in the Potomac River.

153
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,001
<i>And so the standoff</i>
<i>continued, hours passed...</i>

154
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,170
<i>then days.</i>

155
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,472
Days passed?
Days passed.

156
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,876
<i>Finally, a T.R. stricken</i>
<i>by tropical fever</i>

157
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,546
<i>on his Amazon trek,</i>
<i>we could go no further.</i>

158
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,082
When he was Assistant Secretary
of the Navy...

159
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,650
Will you just pick
one of us already

160
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,719
so I can either have sex
or go to sleep!

161
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,890
Smooth, bro.

162
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,492
After that day,
I have never liked that guy.

163
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,628
So let's just tell Robin
this can't be done,

164
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,263
and send Gary Blauman packing.

165
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,731
Did you just say

166
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,332
Gary Blauman?

167
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,233
Yeah.

168
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,602
I...

169
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,371
love that guy!

170
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,839
What?! He's the devil!

171
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,708
He's an angel.

172
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,811
It was 2006,
Marshall and I had broken up,

173
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,913
and I was back in New York
feeling vulnerable

174
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,415
and listening to
my breakup song over and over.

175
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,718
Sugar Ray's "Fly."
You know it.

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,586
Man, you know nothing
about breakups.

177
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,954
I really don't.

178
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,523
Anyway, then I hit bottom.

179
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,691
There's a bottom
below Sugar Ray?

180
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,426
Mm.

181
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,361
What?!

182
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,397
Why have I never
seen that before?

183
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,565
I've been using cover-up

184
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,900
and strategically placed straps
for a long time

185
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,769
to keep this puppy quiet.

186
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,038
After all the times
you guys made fun of me

187
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,539
for my breakup butterfly
tattoo?

188
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,877
Oh, the fact that Ted got
a butterfly tattoo,

189
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,079
will you ever stop
being hilarious?

190
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,081
So why is it only
half a butterfly?

191
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,485
Because Gary Blauman saw me
in the tattoo parlor,

192
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,121
dragged me out
and talked some sense into me.

193
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,889
Lily, trust me,

194
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,024
you and Marshall
are going to get back together.

195
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:10,094
And when you do, you will
be so glad you did not get

196
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,763
the other half
of that butterfly.

197
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,933
Actually, I was gonna get a
little more than the butterfly.

198
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,105
It's good that I ran into you.

199
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,374
Marshall, Blauman saved you
from a lifetime

200
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,444
of looking at Sugar Ray every
time we do it on your birthday.

201
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,945
Find him a nice seat.

202
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,248
No, no, do not find him a seat.

203
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,049
I'm telling you, this guy...
You find him a nice...

204
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,484
<i>Neither of us</i>
<i>was gonna back down,</i>

205
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,920
so finally we decided
to take it to the groom.

206
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,856
Wh-What's going on?
Shh!

207
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,024
Wha...?

208
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:43,961
Who's that guy?

209
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,130
It's my ex-boyfriend.

210
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,450
So, we're crouching
behind a van,

211
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:53,052
hiding from
your ex-boyfriend.

212
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:56,088
Forgive me, I'm a little bit
of a detective.

213
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,723
It was a bad breakup?

214
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,091
Pretty bad.

215
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,059
Bad like
there was a big fight?

216
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,162
Bad like there was
a big ring.

217
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:05,297
Bad like this happened
in the past year?

218
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,367
Bad like it
happened Saturday.

219
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:10,335
So bad.

220
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:11,603
Yeah.

221
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:15,674
Okay, he's gone.

222
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:19,278
I'm so sorry, Ted.

223
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,947
I really like you,
but I'm-I'm in

224
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,816
the weirdest place on Earth
right now.

225
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,518
You're in a Scottish-Mexican
restaurant?

226
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:28,787
Yup.

227
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,323
Yeah, I am.

228
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,960
It's just too soon
for me to be dating.

229
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:36,895
I think I should head home.

230
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:40,365
Well, want me to walk with you?

231
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,035
Lots of scary ex-boyfriends
in this neighborhood.

232
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:44,870
Sure.

233
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,406
I do want to hear
the rest of that story.

234
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:49,107
Right, right the story.

235
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:50,209
Yeah.

236
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:53,545
So, we decided
to take it to the groom.

237
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:55,180
Did you say Gary Blauman?

238
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,348
Yeah.

239
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,649
Gary Blauman?

240
00:08:57,651 --> 00:08:58,450
Yes.

241
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:01,520
Blauman... comma, Gary?

242
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:03,822
Point, comma,
get to the damn.

243
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:06,658
I...

244
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,234
love...

245
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,402
that we have the opportunity
to destroy

246
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:20,539
Gary Blauman's weekend by
kicking him out of the wedding!

247
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,909
Yes! Gary Blauman Haters' Club
right here!

248
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,744
What that guy did to me.

249
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:28,347
Oh... God!

250
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:29,414
It makes me

251
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,583
furious to this day!

252
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:34,019
Okay, okay, I'm gonna try
and tell this story

253
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,621
without completely losing it.

254
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:37,689
Ready? Okay, here goes.

255
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:39,224
I was at the...

256
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,029
Nope, not gonna happen.
Give me a second.

257
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,597
Ooh!
Ooh!

258
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,299
I was at the bar.

259
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:49,167
Hey, Barney!

260
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,502
What's up, Blauman?
Have a seat.

261
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:51,737
Oh, thanks.

262
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,239
Your fries.
Need anything?

263
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,941
I'm good, thanks.

264
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,810
Oh, but he was not good, thanks.

265
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:01,079
He was not good, thanks, at all!

266
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:04,116
Oh, what? Did he take
one of your fries?

267
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:05,817
Take one?

268
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,420
Take one?

269
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,188
Lily, it would have been
one thing

270
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,158
if he took one of my fries;
that would have been one thing.

271
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,861
No, Lily, that day,

272
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:18,030
Blauman took...

273
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,935
...four of my fries!

274
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:26,271
But that's not even the capper!

275
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,774
<i>Here's the part that still</i>
<i>keeps me up at night:</i>

276
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:30,709
<i>the fourth fry he took...</i>

277
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:33,245
the fourth fry he took...

278
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:37,816
Buddy, you oka... you okay?

279
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:43,088
The fourth fry he took...

280
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,759
...was an accidental curly.

281
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,841
You don't take
a man's accidental curly.

282
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:03,909
You take a man's wife

283
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,478
before you take
his accidental curly.

284
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,312
If you wanted

285
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:09,047
curly fries so bad,

286
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:11,483
why not just order them
in the first place?

287
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:12,551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:13,852
'Cause that's
what you want.

289
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,721
All curly fries.

290
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:18,457
Regular cut with
a few accidental curlies.

291
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:19,624
That's what you want.

292
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,126
That's the dream.
He's right.

293
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,228
That is the dream.
No!

294
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,364
I refuse to look
down from the altar

295
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:28,500
as I say my vows to
the woman of my dreams,

296
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:31,703
and see that
damned, stupid,

297
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,705
accidental-curly-
fry-stealing

298
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,674
Gary Blauman!

299
00:11:35,676 --> 00:11:37,008
Did you say Gary Blauman?

300
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,078
I...

301
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,747
hate...

302
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:43,382
to disagree with Barney.

303
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,517
But I love that guy!

304
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,353
<i>I just met him earlier today.</i>

305
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:49,821
Oh, my gosh!

306
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:50,922
It's you.

307
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,057
Yeah.

308
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,259
You're the poet William Zabka.

309
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,163
Nobody ever recognizes me
for my poetry.

310
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:00,031
He has all six
of my collections.

311
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,067
When Terry Gross interviewed me

312
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,302
on <i>Fresh Air,</i> he listened live.

313
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,272
Gary Blauman rules!

314
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:08,573
Gary Blauman?

315
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,743
I...

316
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:13,745
hate...

317
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,715
...that I once thought
I loved Gary Blauman.

318
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:19,284
Ooh, this sounds good.

319
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:21,920
Gary's the guy
that I had an affair with.

320
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:25,690
Tom found out,
threw me out of the house.

321
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:28,760
Now the kids are
from a broken home.

322
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:32,297
Because of Gary Blauman,
everything that matters to me

323
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,399
is gone.

324
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,804
I got that beat.

325
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:40,338
So, I was ordering
these fries...

326
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

327
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:42,841
Blauman's gay?

328
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:43,942
Well...

329
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,577
then that means that night,

330
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,548
the real battle
was between Blauman

331
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,450
and the girl.

332
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:54,719
And the prize... was this guy.

333
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,489
Keep telling yourself
that, buddy.

334
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,191
I don't want to see Gary Blauman
at my brother's wedding.

335
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:00,311
Neither do I!

336
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:01,427
I'm the brother in question!
Now, now, hold on.

337
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:06,465
Order! Order!

338
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:09,434
Robin put this on my plate,
and so I'll make the decision.

339
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:12,003
Now, let's take a short recess.

340
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:12,971
Everybody out.

341
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:14,439
Okay.

342
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:17,342
Lily, out of court settlement.

343
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:20,045
Drop this whole thing,
and I'll give you ten bucks.

344
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,947
No.

345
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,518
I can't go higher than ten.

346
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:32,624
I'm ready to give
my decision.

347
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:33,725
This was a tough one.

348
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,527
Lot of good points
on both sides.

349
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,396
But ultimately... Blauman stays.

350
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:39,464
Yeah.
What in the...?

351
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:40,799
For one simple reason.

352
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:43,935
There is a higher law
at every wedding.

353
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,471
A law that trumps
all other arguments.

354
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:49,841
When the bride asks
for something, she gets it.

355
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:50,709
Yes.

356
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,210
- Wow.
- Good point.

357
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,378
He's right.

358
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,780
This fake court thing
is adjourned.

359
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:58,717
Judged.

360
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,485
Well, I guess
let's go find Blauman

361
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:01,887
and tell him the good news.

362
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,588
Yeah, about that.
Bit of a wrinkle.

363
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,924
I was just in the hallway,
ran into Blauman.

364
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:07,859
I told him
if he didn't leave immediately,

365
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,995
then Billy Zabka was gonna
crane-kick him in the face.

366
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,096
What?!

367
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:12,731
But that's not
even my move!

368
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,598
I...

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,533
We have to stop him.

370
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:15,901
Barney!
I...

371
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:17,669
Come on, come on, come on.

372
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:19,170
So, we all run out
to the parking lot

373
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,740
to stop Gary Blauman from
leaving the wedding...

374
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:24,442
What are you doing?

375
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:25,844
This is my place.

376
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:28,480
Oh.

377
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:29,948
So, uh...

378
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,151
well, I guess this...
this is where I leave you.

379
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,557
This is your place.

380
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,326
Yup.

381
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:44,262
You sure it's not
a few blocks that way?

382
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:46,664
Nope, it's right here.

383
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,933
It's right
where you picked me up.

384
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,601
So it is.

385
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:55,740
Well... good night.

386
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:56,774
Good night.

387
00:14:58,243 --> 00:14:59,978
<i>Eight years earlier,</i>
<i>I probably would've given</i>

388
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,546
<i>some embarrassing speech,</i>
<i>confessed my love</i>

389
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:02,780
<i>and scared her off.</i>

390
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,282
<i>But I didn't.</i>

391
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:07,251
<i>Because somehow I just knew</i>
<i>this was all gonna work out.</i>

392
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,087
Ted?
Oh, thank God.

393
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,627
Do you at least want
to finish your story?

394
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,731
Right.

395
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:23,034
So, we all ran out
to the parking lot, and...

396
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:25,269
Blauman, Blauman,
I'm sorry.

397
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,372
You can stay. Billy won't
kick you in the face.

398
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:28,673
It's not even my move.

399
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:30,675
If I was gonna do anything,
I'd sweep the leg,

400
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:32,877
and put you in a body bag;
everyone knows that.

401
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,480
What...?
Is that from one of your poems?

402
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,248
Thank you for that.

403
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,084
Please stick around,
for the bride.

404
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,453
You're not a Taft.
Even if you are,

405
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,022
Roosevelt shouldn't have
divided the party like that.

406
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:45,656
I mean, he handed the
election to Wilson.

407
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,325
Completely, right?
Right? Right?

408
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,395
No, wait! No! All right?

409
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:51,629
Forget it!

410
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,298
And, James, I'm sorry

411
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,533
about you and Tom.

412
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:58,236
But you have to stop blaming me
for your own decisions.

413
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,773
Well, guys, take a good look.

414
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:05,209
This face you won't
be seeing again.

415
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,781
Come...

416
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:11,049
The bri... the bri...

417
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:13,551
Gary?

418
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:16,854
He's really leaving.

419
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:18,156
Hey, Barney.

420
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,825
You still, uh,
have my wedding ring?

421
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:23,261
Yeah.

422
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:26,697
I've got some work to do.

423
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,933
Excuse me.

424
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,104
Blauman will cool off
eventually.

425
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:34,272
We'll see him again.

426
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:35,139
Of course we will.

427
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:36,407
I don't know.

428
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,810
I mean, we might
really never see him again.

429
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:41,079
Because I remember
at our wedding

430
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:42,480
looking out and thinking,

431
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,849
"Man, everyone here means
so much to me."

432
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:46,884
A bunch of those people,

433
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:49,320
you know,
I haven't seen them since.

434
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:51,289

435

<i>That being said,</i>

440
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:07,438

Hey, watch it over there.

443
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,978
Yeah, watch it over there!

444
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,880
It's become a family business.

Gosh, caller,
