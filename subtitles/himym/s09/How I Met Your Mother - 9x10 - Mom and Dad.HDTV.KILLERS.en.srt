<i>Oh, boy, it's the creepy,</i>

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,963
bug-eyed minister
from that culty church

6
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:13,433
who kept asking us
if we're "pure enough to die."

7
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:15,235
He's our best lead.
I should get this.

8
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,854
James, unless
you have a minister,

9
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,639
I don't want to hear it.

10
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,407

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,003
Whoa!

00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,440
<i>Reverend Gibbs wouldn't be</i>

17
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:38,925
Dad!

18
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:41,845
Barney. Oh, I can't believe
you're getting married.

19
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:44,097
You've grown up so fast.

20
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:48,334
Then again, I did miss
about 30 years of your life.

21
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,770
Did I mention we got you
two things from your registry?

22
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:53,439
Hey, can we buy you guys
a drink in a bit?

23
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:54,774
Sure. We'll meet you
at the bar.

24
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,059
Yeah.

25
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:57,393
Here.
All right.

26
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,561
Hey.

27
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:00,463
Oh. Whoa. Look.

28
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,065
My dad hasn't seen
my mom in years,

29
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,283
not since he bailed on her.

30
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:05,485
Oh, man, take it from a
fellow child of divorce,

31
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,237
this could
get real messy.

32
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,539
Loretta, good to see you.

33
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,741

God, no drama.

and he says-- get this--

66
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,773

"Weather's improving, huh?"

00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,866
but... Jerry's married.

70
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,335
So what? Marriage is just
a meaningless piece of paper.

71
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,486
I'm a lucky gal.

72
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:53,788

isn't gonna happen.

00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:11,125
You'll be cold, so I'll send
down strawberry warming gel

130

00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:16,063

"Oh, God, that's horrible.
Detective Mosby's the worst."

142
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,154
Mm, Detective Mosby is

143
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,872
the case-crackingest
private dick on the scene.

144
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,375
Really? Like that case

145
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,093

00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,385
My greatest failure.

149
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,020
I will solve this case.

150
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,521
Now, there were
three people nearby

151
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,190
when Barney gave me
that head shot:

152
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,610
Karate Kid <i>bad boy Billy Zabka,</i>

153
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,013
<i>a shifty-eyed bellhop,</i>

154
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,348
<i>and Robin's cousin Claude</i>
<i>from Quebec</i>

155
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,317
<i>with the neck trouble.</i>

156
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,687
Right, 'cause an elaborate
conspiracy is much more likely

157
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,041
than you leaving the photo
next to an open ink bottle.

158
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,194
Thank you!
You can't even detect sarcasm!

159
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:22,463
Why don't you just
try to fix the photo?

160
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,714
Don't you have ink remover?

161
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,999
Of course I have ink remover.

162
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,867
I'm not one of those sloppy,
punk calligraphers

163
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,386
who's in it
for glory over craft.

164
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,304
No, we got to solve this!

165
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,839
Now, the question is,

166
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,892
which of those three suspects
had the most cause to frame me?

167
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,213

<i>as Barney's best man?</i>

168
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,899
I'm coming for you, Mosby.

169
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,934
Billy Zabka!

170
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,720
Okay, real quick,
I need fresh-cut

171
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:49,240
English lavender, a copy of
Shakespeare's 18th sonnet,

172
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,826
and enough Nutella
to cover a 60-year-old woman.

173
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,029
Oh, great. You guys escaped.

174
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,363
Got rescued!

175
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:57,698
Are you okay?

176
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,033
A bit shaken up.

177
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,901
Being trapped
in an elevator is scary.

178
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,837
No, Barney lowered in a TV

179
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,257
showing some pretty
graphic 1970s pornography.

180
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,459
Still, a lot
of familiar faces in there.

181
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,927
Well, not just faces.

182
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,129
I'm gonna go
find my wife.

183
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:16,250
Nice job, bro.

184
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:18,919
Mom was just about
to get some action

185
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,554
for the first time
since she conceived me.

186
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,922
Barney, this has to stop.

187
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,107
You're being delusional.

188
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,325
Mom is not getting back
together with Jerry.

189
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,928
Because she's getting back
together with my daddy!

190
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,913
I see what you're doing.

191
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,064
You didn't bring your dad here
to marry us.

192
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,116
You want him to get back
together with Mom!

193
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,519
Which is completely insane,
by the way.

194
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:43,988
Um, my dad's single,
Mom's single.

195
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,956
Your dad's happily married
with two kids.

196
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,291
Which one makes more sense?

197
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,859
I agree. It's a tie.

198
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,044
What do we do?

199
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,178
You back down

200
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,763
and let me get my mom
and dad back together?

201
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,265
Um, how about <i>you</i> back down

202
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,384
and let me get <i>my</i> mom and dad
back together?

203
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,519

- I'm marrying into this family.
- Stop.

237
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:25,856
You stupid!
I won't stop.

238
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,977
Where the heck is
this parasailing place?

239
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,195
You know what?

240
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:32,863
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call Jerry.

241
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,366
Oh, that's weird.

242
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,201
I just lost cell reception.

243
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,036
Yes.

244
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,622
Weird.

245
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:46,327
Lot of pretty paintings
in this hotel.

246
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,462
I like how
they've been... framed.

247
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,081
I've noticed
the vintage, antique,

248
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,633
gilded Victorian frames, too.

249
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,719
I'm not blind...
but what are you getting at?

250
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,354
You know damn well
what I'm getting at!

251
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,223
You're jealous I got
the Best Mansmanship back,

252
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,542
<i>so you destroyed that photo as</i>
<i>part of some diabolical scheme</i>

253
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:03,427
<i>to make me look bad.</i>

254
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,346
<i>I bet you even found some other</i>
<i>photo of Wayne Gretzky</i>

255
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,514
so you could swoop in
and save the day.

256
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,848
You're insane.
Am I?

257
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,983
Yeah. Yeah.
Am I?

258
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,735
Where were you today
at 3:15 p.m.?

259
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,904
Right here
getting a massage.

260
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,190
Rocked a 60-minute
deep tish.

261
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,108
Now if you'll excuse
me, Detective,

262
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,227
I think I'll go
have some pineapple.

263
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,746
How do you know about that?

264
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,032
Everybody knows about that!

265
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:28,169
Excuse me?
Mm?

266
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,920
You destroyed that photo,
didn't you?

267
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,071
No, I didn't.

268
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,406
Admit it! I complained about you

269
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,875
to the bell captain,
so you got your revenge.

270
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:36,544
You complained about me?

271
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:40,047
No.

272
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,101
So, Claude...

273
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,387
I see that you're
a Montreal Canadiens fan.

274
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:49,390
Which means you hate
the Edmonton Oilers,

275
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:51,559
which is why you destroyed
the Wayne Gretzky head shot!

276
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:52,643
<i>J'accuse!</i>

277
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:54,428
<i>C'est ridicule!</i>

278
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,980
If it's so <i>ridicule,</i>

279
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:58,983
how do you explain this?

280
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,818
Ah, seems
like I've caught you...

281
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,437
midnight blue-handed.

282
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,955
Oh, these.
Yeah.

283
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,575
I-I was out by the water when...

284
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:11,212
an elderly R-Rastafarian
hang glider...

285
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:13,664
he-he crash
onto a beached squid,

286
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,751
which squirted ink
when I ran in to help.

287
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,786
You really expect me
to believe that?

288
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:22,790
Story checks out.

289
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,725
Sorry, Claude.

290
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,261
<i>De rien.</i>

291
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:29,013
I don't get it.

292
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:29,980
We were bonding.

293
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:34,435
I can't think of
anything I did wrong!

294
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:36,303
Okay, I did a few things wrong.

295
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:37,688
For the last time,

296
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,808
I did not leave the bag of
oranges you bought on the roof!

297
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:46,780
No more breaking the
speed limit. And, uh,

298
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:50,367
thanks for flagging me down and
telling me she was going 67.

299
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,202
Just following the rules,
Officer.

300
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:55,489
Oh. She's also not
wearing her seat belt.

301
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,010
You are not allowed
to use that word!

302
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,263
Only <i>we're</i> allowed
to use that word!

303
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:04,632
I am so sorry.

304
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:05,516
I will never

305
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,135
call you or anyone else a...

306
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:10,054
Trekkie again.

307
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:12,556
But I apologized
and you accepted.

308
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:14,858
I even bought you more oranges.

309
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,349
Look, it wasn't you, okay?

310
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:25,719
Baby, I know your speech
at the Model U.N. is a big deal,

311
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,205
but I'm just not sure
I'll make it in time.

312
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,623
I'm trying.

313
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,824
You know what?

314
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,543
Don't bother coming.

315
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,499
So, back at the airport,
that story was true?

316
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,533
You have a daughter?

317
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,251
She lives with her dad.

318
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:44,705
And since I travel for work,
I miss a lot of stuff.

319
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:49,009
I only work as hard as I do
to provide for her.

320
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:52,346
But kids,
they don't understand logic.

321
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,815
Kids understand who shows up.

322
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,183
That's why

323
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:57,818
her dad's her hero...

324
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,572
and I get hung up on.

325
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,073
Go see your daughter's speech.

326
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,159
If you show up,
all will be forgiven.

327
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,410
Just drop it.

328
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:08,362
And drop me at home.

329
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:09,947
Then head out to your wedding.

330
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,582
End of discussion.

331
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,252
Barney,
even if your plan worked,

332
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,920
you'd be destroying
your dad's marriage.

333
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,072
Okay, you may have a point.

334
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,207
Can I suggest something?

335
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:21,925
Truce?

336
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,910
We both agree to drop this.

337
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,912
Agreed.

338
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,364
Hey, I got a replacement bottle

339
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:30,184
of 30-year Glen McKenna.
Okay.

340
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,553
Look, even if Mom
never gets back together

341
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:35,305
with either one of our dads,
we're still brothers.

342
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,274
It's not a competition.

343
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,113
I win!

344
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,282
Hoo-hoo!

345
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,657
Get your damn
hands off my mom!

346
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,375
Get your damn hands
on my mom!

347
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:52,709
One on, one off?

348
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,845
What the hell is
going on here?

349
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,980
After you boys tracked Sam down
a few years back,

350
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,949
we got in touch.
We became friends again,

351
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,984
started hanging out.
And then one day,

352
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,420
she went from being
Loretta to being...

353
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,555
Lo-ret-ta.

354
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:06,974
We wanted to wait
to tell you

355
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,191
because it's still new,

356
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,060
but it was inevitable
you'd find out

357
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,396
once Sam came
to perform the ceremony.

358
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:13,847
Is that what you
two call it?

359
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:16,233
"Performing
the ceremony"?

360
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:17,484
Oh, Sam's marrying you
tomorrow, dear.

361
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,020
Right. Thank you, Reverend.
Look,

362
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,539
is there any way you guys
can be all right with this?

363
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,741
Of course I am!

364
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:27,377
Barney?

365
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,330
I know I've been acting crazy
today, but...

366
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:32,549
I just have
one real question, Mom,

367
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,367
and I want an honest answer.

368
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,136
Is there a scenario--

369
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,170
and hear me out--

370
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:39,339
where you might consider

371
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,875
doing kind of a three-way deal
with both of our dads?

372
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:44,061
God! What is wrong with you?!
Oh, dude, come on!

373
00:14:44,063 --> 00:14:46,313
That's what I thought!

374
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,018
It's time to
admit it, Ted.

375
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,654
You spilled the ink.
There's no conspiracy.

376
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:55,022
I guess you're right.

377
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,440
I mean, the only other person

378
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,742
who saw Barney give me
that photo...

379
00:14:58,744 --> 00:14:59,993
was you.

380
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:03,063
Hey. Idiot.

381
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,731
While you've been

382
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,117
playing detective,
I've been cleaning up your mess.

383
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:10,236
Look, the ink remover works.

384
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:11,004
I'm gonna
finish this.

385
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:13,090
You come clean to Barney.

386
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,574
Okay.

387
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:16,626
She's been
missing all day,

388
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:20,881
a-and I found what appears to be
a-a suicide note on my bed.

389
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,350
But it doesn't
really sound like her.

390
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:27,854
"I'm going to kill my--

391
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,274
Is everything okay
with Mr. Zabka?

392
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:35,261

for James.

I have so many questions

461
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:43,166
you keep 2,000 head shots
of yourself in your trunk?

462
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,968
No one ever wants them!
They only want

00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:39,339
To Barney Stinson, I was
the best man.

483
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:43,059
I thought if Ted screwed up
again, I'd have another shot.

484
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:46,613
But I guess this time
I really was the bad guy.

485
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:48,281
Hey, Ted,
what's so urgent?

486
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,867
I have something
to tell you.

487
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,687
I destroyed
that Gretzky head shot

488
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:57,190
and I couldn't fix it.
Billy saved the day

489
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,960
