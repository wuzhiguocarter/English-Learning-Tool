1
00:00:01,851 --> 00:00:03,969
<i>I can't believe your mom's</i>
<i>not coming to the wedding?</i>

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,687
Okay, seriously,
I-I need to stop crying

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,040
Does anyone know how
to turn this off?

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,591
Is there, like, a button
or something?

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,360
Want me to feel
around for it?

6
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,994
It's probably
somewhere on your back.

7
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:15,397
Stop it.
What? I'm trying to cheer you up.

8
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:17,282
I don't think that's possible
at this point.

9
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,950
Challenge accepted!

10
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,285
No, Barney,

11
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,588
I just need to get myself
to stop crying, that's all.

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,790
Boogity-boo!

13
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,925
Lily, what the hell?!
It's not the hiccups.

14
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,576
I was just going on a hunch.

15
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:31,213
And now I have the hiccups.

00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,977
Look, guys, just, seriously,
don't worry about me, okay?

19
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,863
Just let me deal
with this on my own.

20
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:50,148
I'm afraid that's
not possible, Robin.

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,568
Once I've accepted a challenge,
it cannot be unaccepted.

22
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,072
I will not rest
until the job is done.

23
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:58,373
Oh, is that so?

24
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,910
Then where are our diapers
and Samosas?

25
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,378
Aha!

26
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,881
<i>Diapers and Samosas.</i>
<i>Oh, that's about something</i>

27
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:09,050
<i>that happened six months</i>
<i>earlier in the fall of 2012.</i>

28
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,553
Major craving for a mojito.

29
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:12,921
Oh, God, we're back

30
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,507
to your stupid little
private joke again?

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,226
Are you guys really still doing
this seven years later?

32
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:20,679
It's so annoying. Just stop it.

33
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,013
Private joke again?

34
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,182
Are you guys really still
doing this seven years later?

35
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,734
It's so annoying.
Just stop it.

36
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,486
You don't salute a private!

37
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,471
I'll be right back.
All right.

38
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:31,973
Lily, are you playing
footsie with me?

39
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,191
What?

40
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,777
Oh, no, no. I was just feeling
around for your shin.

41
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,362
My shin? Why would you...?

42
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,947
Ow! Why'd you do that?

43
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,415
To remind you what pain is.

44
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,952
You keep it up with all the
cutesy-tootsy stuff with Robin,

45
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:47,322
gonna be a whole lot more
where that came from.

46
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,040
Lily, you have nothing
to worry about.

47
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,659
I better not.
You and Robin are platonic.

48
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:54,662
Please.
Ted and Robin are not platonic.

49
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:56,765
Just like me and Robin
are not platonic.

50
00:01:56,767 --> 00:02:00,552
Just like no two single people
in the world are ever platonic.

51
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,388
Symposium: two people
are only platonic if

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,740
in the next 20 minutes

53
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:06,912
there is no chance
of them hooking up.

54
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:11,613
Truth is, I only know of one
genuinely platonic relationship.

55
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:12,680
You and me.

56
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:13,782
Don't make me laugh, Lily.

57
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,283
You want to hit this
so hard.

58
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:19,204
Seriously, she's playing
footsies with me as I... Ow!

59
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,741
No, I'm talking
about Marshall and Robin.

60
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,744
<i>Marshall and Robin wouldn't</i>
<i><i><i>hook up even if this happened:</i>

61
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,379
Marshall, Robin!

62
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,215
If you guys don't full-on
make out in the next 20 minutes,

63
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,751
they're gonna blow me up
and everyone in this bar!

64
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,869
My God, no!
Anyone but Robin.

65
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,688
I really don't want
to do this!

66
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,890
Guys, we have no time!
Just do it!

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

68
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,734
I'm sorry, baby,
I just, I can't do it.

69
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,485
Aw...

70
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,072
And the only survivor
was me

71
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,391
because I was upstairs
banging Ted's mom.

72
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,893
What? Get that blond girl's
phone number?

73
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,278
Challenge accepted.

74
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,201
Unknown caller, stop calling me.

75
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,235
Are you gonna answer it?

76
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:08,370
Yeah, 'cause it's 1994

77
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,788
and I'm gonna pick up a phone

78
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,289
without knowing who's on
the other end.

79
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,458
I should get going.

80
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,676
Ted...

81
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,344
Lily, by every definition
of the word platonic,

82
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:18,246
including Barney's fake one,
I can say

83
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,681
with total certainty...

84
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:20,966
that Brussels sprouts

85
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,917
are the comeback vegetable
of the 21st century.

86
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,085
Well, see you guys later.

87
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:25,887
Bye.

88
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,391
Challenge completed.

89
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:32,143
I'm sorry. I-I missed
the first half of this.

90
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,395
Um, why is picking up

91
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:36,481
a drunk chick sitting alone
and rubbing a tan line

92
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,618
on her finger where a wedding
ring used to be, a challenge?

93
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,504
Because I said
challenge accepted.

94
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,489
See? That's your problem,
Barney.

95
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,492
You only accept challenges
you came up with.

96
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,295
Just once,
I'd like to see you accept

97
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,663
someone else's challenge.

98
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,182
Challenge acc...
Wait-- what's the challenge?

99
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:58,053
Interesting. An opportunity rife
with possibilities.

100
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:59,387
We need to find something

101
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,139
with just the right amount
of poetic...

102
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,392
Get a girl's number
while talking like a dolphin!

103
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,294
That works.

104
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,143
Open your eyes, ref!
That's not a pregnant lady!

105
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,162
It's a basketball
under his shirt!

106
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,997
Blow the freakin'
whistle!

107
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,617
Anyways, Barney's right;

108
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,652
I would absolutely
let the bar blow up.

109
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:33,455
But you'd die, and
Lily would die, too.

110
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,957
Yeah, but then we could
haunt the bar for eternity

111
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,009
like we always planned.
Anyways, Robin's your girl.

112
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,878
Why do we keep
coming back to this?

113
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,097
It's fun. Tickets are cheap.
Gets us out of the house.

114
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,598
No, me and Robin.

115
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:48,520
Because Robin told me that
she's still in love with you.

116
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,113
Are you serious?
Robin told you that she's

117
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:55,446
still in love with me?

118
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:56,979
No, I just made that up.

119
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,031
But it was worth it
because I can tell

120
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,017
by that look on your face
that you still have feelings for Robin.

121
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,620
Okay, ball is sitting
on the basket!

122
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:07,808
That's not only illegal,
it's unsafe!

123
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,094
Come on, Gens, D up!

124
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:13,247
It's this monastery
in Connecticut out in the woods,

125
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:16,367
and the nuns there,
they make this gourmet cheese.

126
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:17,701
It's just amazing.

127
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,655
Wow, was that
three glasses of wine?

128
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,090
Where does the time go

129
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:27,178
Look, I know
that you need

130
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,662
to get back
to your studies.

131
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:31,265
Maybe we could get together
some other time?

132
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:35,102
No! Not possible!

133
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:36,887
It was the performance
of a lifetime.

134
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,152
Man, if I'd have hung around
for a few more minutes,

135
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:38,711
I probably could have

136
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,879
gotten her to touch my blowhole.
Give me that.

137
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,563
Hello?

138
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:47,514
Hi, did you just give
your phone number to a guy

139
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:48,649
who was squeaking
like a dolphin?

140
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:50,818
Yeah.

141
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,902
Honey, listen to me.

142
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:54,155
I need you to take
a year, a full year

143
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,623
and just be
celibate, okay?

144
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,790
No boys.

145
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,209
One year.

146
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:00,127
I think you know
I'm right about this.

147
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,579
You're right.

148
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,880
Yeah.

149
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,298
That was heartbreaking

150
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,867
And pants-breaking
Boing-oing-oing!

151
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,419
All right, next challenge.

152
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,471
Oh, this is an all-night thing?

153
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:14,675
Okay, um, pick up a girl...

154
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:16,227
wearing a garbage bag.

155
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,730
I'd be <i>"Glad"</i> to.

156
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,650
Just hope she's not too <i>"Hefty""</i>

157
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:26,937
And those are all of the brands
of trash bags I can think of.

158
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,022
I'm not done.

159
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:32,409
You also can't use
the letter "E."

160
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:39,083
Challng... accptd-d.

161
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:42,203
You're single,
she's single,

162
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,504
It's time to do this.

163
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:45,456
You're only saying this
because you bet Lily

164
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,407
that Robin and I would
end up together,

165
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,909
and you want
that five bucks.

166
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,511
I need that five bucks, Ted.

167
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:53,264
But more importantly,
I need you to be happy.

168
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,349
Marshall, we're platonic.

169
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:56,767
But you're not platonic!

170
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:59,436
You are 20 short minutes away
from happily ever after.

171
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:02,022
I mean, if you left
right now.

172
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,111
Hey.

173
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:09,063
I have loved you from
the moment we met.

174
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:10,430
I know we're meant
to be together.

175
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,899
I don't want to waste
another second without you.

176
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:12,983
Let's give it
another shot.

177
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:14,601
Okay!

178
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:16,603
No!

179
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,739
Pay up, baby.
Pay up.

180
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,440
Oh, yes!

181
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:23,777
♪ Sweet, sweet five bucks,
you soon will be mine ♪

182
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,247
♪ Even though Lily
and I share bank accounts ♪

183
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:29,083
♪ You're already mine
to begin with. ♪ Sorry.

184
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:32,903
And you and Robin get a lifetime
of happiness, so there's that.

185
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:34,054
But you better hurry up

186
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,455
before some other guy
snatches her up.

187
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,474
Really? And who's
my competition?

188
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:42,479
Okay, don't use the letter "E."
Don't use the letter "E."

189
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:44,732
Hey.

190
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:46,767
Damn it.

191
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,321
Hi. I... am...

192
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:52,189
Barney. Damn it!

193
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:53,591
There's an E
in my name!

194
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:57,578
Hi. My word for...

195
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,198
this guy is Barno.

196
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:07,371
Barno. You look...

197
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,123
not ugly.

198
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,376
Your... dial thing...

199
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:13,377
is what?

200
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,180
Do you want
to just go back to my place?

201
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,132
Yes. Damn it!

202
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,552
I want to buy you a drink.

203
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:26,056
But first, what do I call you?

204
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:27,691
Elaine Edelstein.

205
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:33,564
How about I just call you...

206
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,865
tomorrow?

207
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:38,452
Your digits, m'lady?

208
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,904
Seriously, guys,

209
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,906
you're gonna have
to try harder than that.

210
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:45,159
Challenge accepted.

211
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:47,694
Excuse me, hi.

212
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,130
I'm Ryan Gosling's
personal assistant.

213
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:52,416
He saw you
as you were walking in,

214
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:55,753
and he sent me over
to tell you to wait here.

215
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,254
Be cool. This is real, okay?

216
00:08:57,256 --> 00:09:00,758
But listen, Ryan is super shy.

217
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,976
Aw...
I know.

218
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,879
Which means that if he comes in
here and he sees you talking

219
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:08,849
to some other guy, he's gonna
turn right around and leave.

220
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,352
Nod if you understand.

221
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:13,270
Redhead at the bar.

222
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,688
Challenge accepted.

223
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,342
Hey, there.
Get away from me!

224
00:09:18,344 --> 00:09:20,727
It's like you're trying
to lose, Eddie!

225
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:22,112
Hey, Eddie,
last time I saw

226
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:24,114
this many turnovers
was at a bakery. - Oh!

227
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,867
So are you doing this or what?
No.

228
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,002
And for the record,
if I were gonna do it,

229
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:32,089
I wouldn't just be, like,
"Hey, we should get back together".

230
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:33,257
Amateur hour.

231
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,292
Here's how you do it.

232
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:40,097
Excuse me. Okay, sorry.

233
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,466
Sorry.

234
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:44,535
Huh.

235
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,391
Stop, thief!

236
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:56,230
<i>The blue French horn,</i>
<i>it's so romantic!</i>

237
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:58,515
Oh, my God, do you know
who you are?!

238
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,367
You're Nicholas Sparks!

239
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:03,437
Hey, everybody, we got
a, uh, celebrity

240
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:06,457
in the crowd over here.
We got, uh, Nicholas Sparks!

241
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,125
You didn't let me finish.

242
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,210
Ted, listen...

243
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,380
I can do without reliving that.

244
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:15,582
Are you completely blind?

245
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:16,383
What?

246
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,135
Open your eyes, ref!

247
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:20,804
The ball hasn't touched
the ground in seven minutes!

248
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:22,339
Hey, ref, check
your voicemail!

249
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:24,341
I think you've missed
a few calls!

250
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:29,796
Are you completely blind?!

251
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:30,931
Wait-- me or...?

252
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,483
You, Ted!

253
00:10:32,485 --> 00:10:33,851
Robin has changed her mind.

254
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,686
No, Robin doesn't change
her mind.

255
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:37,104
Except that she does.

256
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,940
Remember how she used to claim
to hate white guy funk bands?

257
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:42,025
And yet, at the farewell
performance of my band,

258
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,778
"The Funk, the Whole Funk
and Nothing but the Funk,"

259
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,747
there's Robin
rhythmically nodding her head

260
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,333
and shouting out a request
for "Give Up the Funk."

261
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:52,486
I think she was nodding her head
in response to my question,

262
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,821
"Do you want
to leave soon?"

263
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,457
And she was
legitimately suggesting

264
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,091
that you give up the funk.

265
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:01,661
Can we just drop this?
I have moved on.

266
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,213
Well, except that you haven't.

267
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:05,716
You didn't just come up with
this blue French horn thing.

268
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:07,050
You've thought about this.

269
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:08,352
Mr. Sparks?

270
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:09,887
I loved <i>The Notebook.</i>

271
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:12,756
Eddie, you're down by 80.

272
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:14,808
Will you watch the ge?

273
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,895
Do not come any closer!

274
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:19,062
I swear to God I will kill you.

275
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:21,782
It's cool.
I'm not gonna come any closer.

276
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:24,535
You're looking at the door,
you're waiting for someone.

277
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,820
Someone important,
someone who will fill

278
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:28,555
an empty space in your life.

279
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,741
A movie star?

280
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:31,992
Ah-huh.

281
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,361
But which one?

282
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,963
Clooney,

283
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:39,383
DiCaprio, Zabka...?

284
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:41,235
No...

285
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:43,754
I'm gonna go with Ryan...

286
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:46,323
Reyn...

287
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:47,591
Phil-Phillip...

288
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:50,294
Seacr... Gosling...

289
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,062
Ryan Gosling!

290
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:53,647
Yes, I'm waiting
for Ryan Gosling, okay?

291
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,816
Now, leave me alone.

292
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:03,440
You passed my test, girl.

293
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,278
- Ryan?
<i>- No.</i>

294
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,614
Just... no.

295
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:11,915
I told her I'm a method actor.

296
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,567
And I had to get plastic surgery

297
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,536
for an upcoming role
where I play a man

298
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:17,404
much more handsome than myself.

299
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:19,673
Congratulations, you win.

300
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:21,074
Win? No, I don't want to win.

301
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:23,460
I want to keep playing.
More challenges.

302
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:24,711
Fine, you want
another challenge?

303
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,847
More challenges,
more challenges.

304
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:27,931
Fine, here's your challenge.

305
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,584
Go down to the pharmacy
and buy some diapers.

306
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:33,637
And, uh, get me a Samosa
from the Indian place.

307
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,639
Sounds like an errand.

308
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,724
While picking up a girl.

309
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:40,310
Challenge accepted!

310
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,478
Come on!

311
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,496
Whatever happened to the guy

312
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:43,530
who wasn't afraid to charge

313
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:44,948
headlong into the unknown?

314
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,617
What unknown?

315
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:47,767
Sure, eight years ago

316
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,319
when I stole
that blue French horn, yeah.

317
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:50,770
That was the unknown.

318
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:52,990
But now? I mean, how many times
have we been here?

319
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:55,075
I know exactly
what's gonna happen.

320
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:57,777
You know who else knew exactly
what was gonna happen, Ted?

321
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,714
The Washington Generals
on January 5, 1971.

322
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:03,166
They knew they were gonna lose,
but they went in there anyway,

323
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,668
and then gave it
their best shot.

324
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,453
And they won that game, Ted!

325
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:08,422
For one reason
and for one reason only.

326
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:10,957
A scoring error and the fact
that Curly Neal had the flu?

327
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,976
Perseverance.

328
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:15,062
It was the only win
in Generals history,

329
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,763
but that's all <i>you</i> need.

330
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,148
Just one win.

331
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:22,486
I'm gonna go
grab us some beers.

332
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,307
Hi, I don't know who this is
or what you're trying to sell,

333
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,976
but you are disturbing me
during the Globetrotters.

334
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:33,947
Hello, Ted,
it's Hammond Druthers.

335
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:39,419
Target acquired.

336
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:50,598
I'm recruiting volunteers

337
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,349
for the starving puppy orphanage
where I work.

338
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:53,683
For free.

339
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:57,454
So, if you wouldn't mind just
writing your number down

340
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,240
on this signup sheet...?

341
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:03,794
Listen, I appreciate
that you feel

342
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:05,195
like you need my number.

343
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:06,363
Um.

344
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,549
Maybe it's because
you're really sad

345
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,250
about something
and this is your way

346
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:11,919
of feeling better
about yourself.

347
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,203
But...

348
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:15,823
since I have a boyfriend,
and I'm pretty sure

349
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,592
I heard you call me a target
earlier over there,

350
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:20,060
Wha...?
I'm gonna go ahead

351
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:21,261
and not give you my number.

352
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:23,530
I'm gonna give you
something even better.

353
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,215
Wow, right to the chase.

354
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:26,567
Meet you in aisle six.

355
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,436
I'm gonna give you this.
Okay.

356
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:31,188
It's gonna be okay.

357
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,440
You're a good guy.

358
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:35,725
You will get through this.

359
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,280
Uh, okay.

360
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,065
Weirdo alert.

361
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:48,071
Have you met...?

362
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:50,958
Excuse me.

363
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,046
What do you mean "sad"?

364
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:57,514
<i>Ted?</i>

365
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:59,383
I'm calling you
from Chicago, Illinois

366
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:00,968
where I'm a key player

367
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,470
in a very successful
architectural firm.

368
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,754
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

369
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,089
All right,
about what you read...

370
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:08,058
You built
that big concave glass tower.

371
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,227
And it melted a few buildings
across the street.

372
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:12,312
Yes, fine, but come on.

373
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:14,698
What architect has made
a major design flaw

374
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,784
that raised the temperature
of the city aquarium

375
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:17,818
to 190 degrees

376
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,103
and killed thousands
of very rare fish?

377
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:23,106
That's the past, Ted.
I'm looking forward.

378
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:25,209
I want you on my team.

379
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,244
And I won't take no
for an answer.

380
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:30,113
No.
I don't think you heard me, Ted.

381
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:32,382
No.
Come on, Ted!

382
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:33,667
Please?

383
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,003
They're gonna give me
a parking spot if you say yes.

384
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:38,255
Do I get a parking spot?
Well, we can go tandem.

385
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:39,789
No.
Every other week then?

386
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,341
No.

387
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:42,366
You know, Chicago's
more of a walking town.

388
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:44,144
No.
All right!

389
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:46,146
You can have the parking spot.

390
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,231
So, that's a yes?

391
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,399
Mm, no.
Look, Ted.

392
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,853
I can make your life
very difficult.

393
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:55,606
How?
How?!

394
00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:59,776
I will call you a lot.

395
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:01,829
I will Tweet at you like crazy.

396
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:05,332
I will live
on your Facebook wall!

397
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,366
We're not Facebook friends.

398
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:07,751
Yeah, what's going on with that?

399
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,504
It's been pending, like,
for eight months now.

400
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:13,257
Look, Ted, you're a...

401
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:15,959
a very hot commodity.

402
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:19,630
Everybody loves the GNB Tower.

403
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:21,548
And how it hasn't blinded
any pilots

404
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,667
on final approach into O'Hare.

405
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,136
And I-I may have told

406
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:27,804
the partners here
that you and I are

407
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:29,022
very, very good friends.

408
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:31,608
So, please, just say
that you'll think about it.

409
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,809
Fine.

410
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,695
I'll think about it.

411
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,980
Druthers shoots, he scores!

412
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:40,850
Sad? Lady, I got 14 girls'
numbers in the last hour.

413
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:43,036
And this was an off night.

414
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:45,322
What can I possibly
be sad about?

415
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:48,041
I think you were in love
and you messed it up.

416
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,044
And every moment of your life
since then

417
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:54,198
has been spent trying to stay
busy enough to ignore that fact.

418
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,167
<i>And that's how Barney met</i>
<i>your mother.</i>

419
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:02,005
Well, the Generals lost.

420
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,423
What a nail biter--
the whole fourth quarter

421
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:04,892
my heart was in my throat.

422
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:06,059
What was the final?

423
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:07,261
216 to 12.

424
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:08,983
Nobody talk to me right
now, I can't even...

425
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:12,683
The strangest thing
happened at the game.

426
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,651
I got a phone call
from an unknown number.

427
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,436
And when I answered I...

428
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:18,272
You're eating olives.

429
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:19,740
Yup.

430
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:20,741
Do you want these?

431
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:22,225
I hate olives.

432
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:23,860
I... thought you hate olives.

433
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,496
I guess I changed my mind.

434
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,833
Ah!

435
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:31,335
Hello, partner!

436
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:34,254
Boy, that just sounds right,
doesn't it?

437
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,673
Yeah, actually, Mr. Druthers.

438
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:38,408
My answer is no.

439
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,261
What? No, Ted, come on!

440
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:45,015
I'm sorry, I still have things
to do here in New York.

441
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:47,083
I am going to build
a tower of glass

442
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:49,353
and melt you with it!

443
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:52,088
No, you won't.
No, I won't, but know this.

444
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,607
After today

445
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,192
this offer

446
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:56,476
is gone forever.

447
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:59,396
When I hang up this phone,
you and I are done.

448
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:02,265
The door is closed!
Okay.

449
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,400
The door's always open, Ted.

450
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:04,934
If you change your mind,
just call me back, okay?

451
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,987
Bye.

452
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:10,273
I think he's coming around.

453
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,875
We tried dating a while back

454
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,977
and it was a disaster.

455
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:16,413
But I-I always regret giving up.

456
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:18,665
It just ended so quickly.

457
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,019
What about you?

458
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,388
You and your boyfriend
gonna go the distance?

459
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,955
I don't know.

460
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:29,142
I think maybe I still
haven't met the right guy.

461
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:31,294
Hmm.

462
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:33,764
I wonder if I know someone
to set you up with.

463
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:39,770
Drawing a blank.

464
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,471
Are you gonna
go get this girl?

465
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:42,522
Or what?

466
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:43,807
I don't know.

467
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,776
I'm kind of
at my peak right now.

468
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:48,645
I don't know if I can
just walk away from the game.

469
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:52,499
Do you want to keep playing
or do you want to win?

470
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:57,320
I want to win.

471
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:00,323
What am I doing?

472
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:02,459
In less than 20 minutes,
Robin and I could be...

473
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:03,677
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
