1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,710
<i>Kids, it was two days</i>

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,328
<i>before Barney</i>
<i>and Robin's wedding,</i>

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,780
<i>and everything was going off</i>
<i>without a hitch.</i>

4
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:08,981
Ah.

5
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,433
Been waiting for the
perfect time for this,

6
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,001
and, my friend,
that time is...

7
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,453
I saw you and Robin
at the carousel.

8
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:17,673
<i>Okay, there was</i>
<i>one slight hitch.</i>

9
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:20,059
<i>She called me to help her,</i>

10
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,444
<i>and there you were</i>

11
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:22,645
<i>in the rain</i>

12
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,580
<i>holding hands with my fiancée.</i>

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,736
What up?

14
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,303
Nothing up.

15
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:32,271
Everything down.

16
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:34,440
All parts of me down.

17
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:35,474
Look,

18
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:37,860
you were busy,
so I-I...

19
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:39,028
I went to the park
to help her look

20
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,446
for this locket
she buried years ago.

21
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,148
She couldn't find it,
she got upset,

22
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,250
I held her hand. End of story.

23
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:49,122
Cool! I just wanted
to air that out.

24
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:50,706
You know, bro to bro.

25
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,508
You're my best friend
and my best man.

26
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,726
Of course I trust you.

27
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:55,094
Oh, come on.

28
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,263
You don't have to cry about it.

29
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,932
It's not that.

30
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,302
That was a $600 bottle
of scotch.

31
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:06,105
Oh, my God.

32
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,145
I hope Marshall gets here
for the rehearsal dinner.

33
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:13,362
Thank you, Linus.

34
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,482
He's somewhere in Wisconsin
in a rental car.

35
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,117
Hertz?
I mean, it hurts a little

36
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,403
but I'm not gonna
cry about it. Hey!

37
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:22,538
We've been doing that
all afternoon.

38
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,873
Oh, who's that for?

39
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,458
Marshpillow.

40
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,194
<i>Kids, as you may recall,</i>
<i>whenever Marshall left town</i>

41
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:29,328
<i>for a few days,</i>

42
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,447
<i>Lily would compensate</i>
<i>with a body pillow</i>

43
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:33,966
<i>she dressed up</i>
<i>and named Marshpillow.</i>

44
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,568
<i>Pretty normal stuff.</i>

45
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,887
<i>But with Marshall stuck driving</i>
<i>across the country,</i>

46
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,922
<i>Lily decided to upgrade.</i>

47
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:43,309
Meet Marshpillow 2.0!

48
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,811
Hey!

49
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,679
Am I on?

50
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,714
Hey, guys!

51
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:49,999
Hey, Marsh.
Hey, Marshall. Hey.

52
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,766
It's like you're
really here.

53
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:52,068
Hey, Ted.

54
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,271
Can you give me a
gander of the environs?

55
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:58,274
Wow!

56
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:02,395
This place
looks beautif...

57
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,131
Wait for it.

58
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,416
He's frozen.

59
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,503
Same thing happened last night
at the worst possible time.

60
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,674
I had just gotten on all fours
and taken off my panti...

61
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:20,796
Now Lily's frozen.

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,430
...ful.

65
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:40,900
This place
is beautiful!

66
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:43,236
Wow. Lily, it looks
like you really put

67
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:45,071
some time
into this, huh?

68
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:47,406
Though I wonder if

69
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:48,774
instead of dressing up

70
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:52,044
your giant husband doll
like Malibu Ken,

71
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,546
you could've spent
a minute or two--

72
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,014
I don't know--

73
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,717
planning the weak ass
bachelorette party you threw me?

74
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:07,376
I-It's possible I forgot
to send out the Evite.

75
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,478
Robin!

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,814
Happy bachelorette party!

77
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,184
You invited Patrice
to my bachelorette party?!

78
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:17,136
No.

79
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,404
You know, it's funny.

80
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,123
When I was planning
Barney's bachelor party,

81
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:25,278
<i>I managed to wrangle</i>
<i>his boyhood hero, Billy Zabka,</i>

82
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,946
<i>from</i> The Karate Kid.

83
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:28,864
But you scored Patrice.

84
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,333
I'm sorry, Robin.

85
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,453
I-I've just been so consumed
with our move to Rome.

86
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:36,222
I guess I forgot
to invite

87
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:37,506
the girls.

88
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,342
Yeah, Lily, I'd like
to show you how it's done.

89
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,428
Billy Zabka, what
a great guy.

90
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,314
Look at how thorough Ted was
planning the best man poker game

91
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:46,849
he's throwing for Barney.

92
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,852
Wait, I think I'm on some sort
of delay here.

93
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:53,139
Best man visor
for the dealer.

94
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,474
Customized playing cards.

95
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,193
Barney's the king.

96
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,611
And...

97
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,762
the queens

98
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:01,681
are naked.

99
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:03,466
It was my first decree.

100
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:06,686
Hmm. Plus, Ted handwrote
all of the table cards

101
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:08,638
for the reception
in calligraphy.

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,656
The man's a wizard
with a pen.

103
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:12,925
Oh. I don't know
about all that.

104
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:13,960
Though I was approached

105
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,128
by the decorating committee
to make the...

106
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,314
signs for our senior prom.

107
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:21,817
I'm told they were
quite the hit.

108
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:25,171
Hey, buddy, listen,

109
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:29,125
you're gonna kill me, but I
forgot to bring the table cards.

110
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,510
Uh, I'd hate to ask
you to redo them...

111
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:33,896
Say no more.
The best man is on it.

112
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,599
Thanks, Ted.

113
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:38,701
S-So now the best man

114
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:42,405
is painstakingly handwriting
200 table cards,

115
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,857
but my maid of
honor forgot

116
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:47,927
to click "send"
on an Evite.

117
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,662
I didn't forget
to invite the girls

118
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,997
to your bachelorette party.

119
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,865
You have no girls!

120
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,083
What?

121
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,636
What?

122
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,704
What?

123
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:01,290
What? I...
All my girls.

124
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,376
I gave you a list.

125
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:04,593
This list?

126
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,544
Yeah.

127
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,246
"Tall girl from work,

128
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:10,049
"mouth-breather
from coffee shop,

129
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:11,384
"average-sized

130
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:13,386
girl from that place"?

131
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,638
Ooh. Sorry I didn't
track her down.

132
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,039
She sounds great!

133
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,025
She's actually
kind of a bitch.

134
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,309
Face it, Robin.

135
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,278
You hate women, and...

136
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
women hate you.

137
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,533
Ted didn't go to his prom?

138
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,052
Classic.

139
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,538
<i>While Lily was dropping the</i>
<i>ball as Robin's maid of honor,</i>

140
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,825
<i>the best man was busy</i>
<i>knocking it out of the park.</i>

141
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:39,278
Hey, buddy, listen,

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,747
my great-aunt Ida has corns
on her feet

143
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:43,499
and needs a first-floor room.

144
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,334
Uh, would you mind
switching rooms?

145
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:47,470
Say no more.
The best man is on it.

146
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,554
Thanks, Ted.

147
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,737
Hey, buddy, listen,

148
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,522
the wedding doves
got here early,

149
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:08,340
and I don't know
where to put 'em...

150
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:10,860
Say no more.
The best man is on it!

151
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:12,361
Thanks, Ted.

152
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:14,747
Poor guys.

153
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,366
All cooped up.

154
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:22,037
I guess there's no harm in
letting you out for a bit, huh?

155
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,440
They carpet-bombed
my entire room.

156
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,741
Wish I'd closed

157
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:28,427
my suitcase.

158
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,180
And my mouth.

159
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,832
Hey, buddy, listen,

160
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:37,520
I see you wrote "N-O-period"
instead of the number sign.

161
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,722
I'm worried that might
confuse the guests...

162
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:39,606
Say no more.

163
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,307
The best man is on it.

164
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:42,725
Thanks, Ted.

165
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,510
Here they are.

166
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:47,679
Freshly penned table cards
in a pretty decent chancery

167
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:50,516
considering I only
had my travel quills.

168
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:53,202
Wait. Why's the
poker game started?

169
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,021
Oh, um, the best man
moved the time.

170
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,423
Mm, no, he didn't.

171
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:58,791
Yes, he did.

172
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,226
Heya, Ted.

173
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,711
Thanks for the sweet lid, bro.

174
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:07,517
Billy Zabka's
your new best man?

175
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:11,153
He's the best... around.

176
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:13,003
Sorry, Ted.
Maybe next wedding.

177
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:13,532
What...

178
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,824
So you're playing the best man
poker game without me?

179
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,676
Tim Gunn's here and I'm not?

180
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,446
I'm Barney's personal tailor,
of course I'm here.

181
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:22,581
Plus, I've never
played poker before.

182
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,833
It looks like a hoot.

183
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,218
I moved into a dungeon.

184
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,970
I wrote hundreds of cards.

185
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,556
I even gave your batty
great-aunt Ida a foot massage

186
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:33,542
so vigorous it put her to
sleep right there in the lobby.

187
00:07:33,544 --> 00:07:36,095
Yeah, I don't really have
a great-aunt Ida.

188
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,885
So you are mad about me
and Robin holding hands.

189
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,237
Of course I'm mad, Ted.

190
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,322
Holding hands is, like,

191
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:47,940
the fourth-grade equivalent
of banging.

192
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,241
Well, in your case, 12th grade.

193
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:50,292
Self-five.

194
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:53,061
You broke the Bro Code.

195
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,698
No, I did not. I only went
to help Robin as a friend

196
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,999
because you didn't show up.

197
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,650
I did not break the Bro Code.

198
00:07:58,652 --> 00:07:59,702
It's in the text.

199
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:02,121
A bro shall not have
a weird moment

200
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,673
with another bro's fiancée.
Well,

201
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:07,459
too bad we're in Farhampton
and can't actually check.

202
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,795
I am pleased to announce
that the Bro Code has replaced

203
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:12,631
the Gideons Bible at select
hotels throughout the country.

204
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,351
Oh.

205
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,586
I'm sorry I said
you hate women.

206
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:18,887
Yeah, don't be.

207
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,723
For whatever reason,
I just...

208
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,891
I can't seem to connect
with them. Down!

209
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,743
Can you help me?
I've got

210
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:26,228
a bunch more wedding gifts
in the van.

211
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,965
Yay! I love Robin so much!

212
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,034
Oh, God, I'm gonna strangle
that bitch.

213
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:35,320
Robin, what is it
with you and women?

214
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:37,423
They're so annoying.

215
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:39,992
I'm glad that you're
my only female friend.

216
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:41,960
Girls are always
whining and crying

217
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,945
over every little thing.

218
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:47,466
Yes. That's exactly...

219
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:51,003
Thank you. "Oh, oh, boo-hoo.

220
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:52,638
"Look at me.
I'm a sensitive

221
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,556
little girl..."
Oh. God, I'm sorry.

222
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:55,974
You're actually crying.

223
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:56,892
It's just

224
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:58,761
so sad.

225
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:01,847
I can't be your only girlfriend.
Well, I...

226
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:04,233
I don't need anybody else.
I got... I got you.

227
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:08,153
For another six days and then
I'm off to Rome for a year.

228
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:11,857
What are you gonna do without
our Saturday morning brunch

229
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,410
with a side of sassy gossip?

230
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,895
A one-shot power play?!

231
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:19,031
Hey! Hey, Boston!

232
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,332
Why not drop your hockey pants

233
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:23,318
and actually take a dump
on the ice next time?!

234
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,989
I love it!

235
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,844
See? It is just too horrible
to even think about.

236
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:32,961
Yeah.
You...

237
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,214
need another female friend.

238
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,965
Whenever I try to talk to women,

239
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,825
they look like they want
to punch me.

240
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,752
Well,

241
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,721
maybe you're accidentally
giving off the wrong vibe.

242
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:46,024
Like, what do you say
to other women at the gym?

243
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,726
Oh, well, I haven't been
to the gym in forever.

244
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,812
My metabolism is all messed up.

245
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:52,197
See, I can moose down a pint
of fudge ripple

246
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:55,901
for a midnight snack
and wake up having lost weight.

247
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:57,069
Well, everywhere

248
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:58,787
except for my boobs.

249
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:00,873
So annoying.

250
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,744
You're gonna need a lot of work.

251
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,830
It's in here.
Somewhere.

252
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:09,781
I... It has to be.

253
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,867
Damn it, I know I should've done
these in alphabrotical order.

254
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,503
Who cares about the Bro Code?

255
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,472
It's just some stupid book
you made up.

256
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:19,174
How dare you?

257
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:22,511
The Bro Code has been around
for centuries.

258
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,146
Nay...

259
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:26,732
whatever's more
than centuries.

260
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,016
Please don't launch
into a fake history lesson.

261
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,770
The Bro Code can trace
its lineage all the way back

262
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:33,989
to Broses himself.

263
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,025
Article one:

264
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,945
bros before ho's.

265
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:41,413
<i>Okay.</i>

266
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,282
I see what you're doing.
You can't prove that

267
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:45,100
I broke the Bro Code, so you're
just making up stories about...

268
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,619
This sacred text
was eventually brought

269
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:51,273
to the New World
in 1776 by none other

270
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,475
than Christopher Brolumbus.

271
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:55,794
Article 62:

272
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:59,932
a bro
who calls dibs first has dibs.

273
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,651
Oh? Dibs!

274
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:05,754
And that's why he got
to bang Pocahontas.

275
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,249
Pocahontas was
with John Smith.

276
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:08,174
Maybe

277
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,525
according to the hotel register.

278
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:10,943
Whatever Mrs. Brolumbus
didn't know

279
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,311
couldn't hurt her, am I right?

280
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,112
Well, except maybe
that New World syphilis.

281
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:15,280
But I digress.

282
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:18,150
Barney, if you believe
in the Bro Code,

283
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,868
how come you've broken it
so many times?

284
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:22,120
How dare you!

285
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:24,489
I have <i>never</i> broken
the Bro Code!

286
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,942
Hmm? Hmm? Ah.

287
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,660
"Article 104:

288
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:32,481
the mom of a bro
is always off limits."

289
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,634
Okay, look,
we've all had a lot of fun

290
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,703
joking about me
banging your mom.

291
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,087
Not all of us. Continue.

292
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:42,724
But I swear nothing ever
happened between the two of us.

293
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:44,509
Trust me.

294
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,128
And what's going on
with your fingers?

295
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,183
That's how our bodies
were intertwined.

296
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,085
All right, this
is ridiculous!

297
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,686
It's ridiculous
that you won't admit

298
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:56,405
holding Robin's hand was weird.

299
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:57,573
It wasn't weird!

300
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:59,074
Yes, it was.

301
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:01,777
You know what?

302
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,281
We need a third
impartial bro to settle this.

303
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:07,766
To resolve this,

304
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,518
I really need to parse

305
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,769
the text of the Bro Code.

306
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,920
It's too bad

307
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,071
Marshall doesn't have a copy.

308
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:15,240
Actually, I do.

309
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:17,926
They were in the, uh,
seat back pockets on my flight

310
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:19,461
in place of the safety cards.

311
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:21,897
I'm also pleased to announce
<i>The Bro Code</i> is now available

312
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,599
in select airlines
across the country.

313
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:25,050
And Lufthansa.

314
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:28,553
<i>Der Bro Code</i> is,
like, huge in Germany.

315
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,472
Okay, so prove to me

316
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,841
you can make a female friend.

317
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:34,676
What about her?

318
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:37,112
Ugh! The girl
with the bangs?

319
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,514
Any chick who does that
to her hair

320
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:41,400
is going through
a big life transition

321
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,068
I don't want to hear about.

322
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,988
Next time, grow your bangs
long enough to cover your mouth.

323
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,122
Ha-pass.

324
00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:48,607
Okay, well...

325
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,242
what about her?

326
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:52,394
Ugh! Comfortable shoes?

327
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,580
What, are you filibustering
later?

328
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,466
It's after 5:00.
Put on some heels.

329
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:58,467
Ha-pass.

330
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:01,553
Okay, well, what about...?
Ugh!

331
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:03,722
I haven't even pointed
to anyone yet!

332
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:05,474
<i>Now,</i>

333
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:09,111
although not expressly stated
in the Bro Code,

334
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,229
a weird moment between

335
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,899
a bro and his bro's fiancée is,

336
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:17,152
in my bropinion... a violation.

337
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:18,737
No!
Yes! However,

338
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:21,056
Ted was helping Robin
as a friend.

339
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:22,190
Therefore,

340
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,291
holding her hand

341
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:25,944
isn't <i>necessarily</i>
a weird moment.

342
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,562
No!
Yes!

343
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:28,580
That being said...

344
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:29,865
What?

345
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,066
...if we decide

346
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,618
that holding <i>any</i> friend's hand
is weird,

347
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,605
then, yes,
Ted did break the Bro Code.

348
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,806
So, the question
is this.

349
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:39,558
If Ted had gone to the park

350
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,543
and held <i>Barney's</i> hand,

351
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:43,779
would it have been weird?

352
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,015
No?
Yes?

353
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,305
See?

354
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:58,060
It's not weird at all.

355
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:00,445
I don't know what to say.

356
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,613
Just be yourself.

357
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:02,898
Say something nice.

358
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,783
Which one? I can't do both.

359
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,106
Slut alert.

360
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,874
That's my 14-year-old daughter.

361
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:17,028
Crappy mom alert.

362
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,163
Ugh!

363
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:19,815
It's you. Nice bangs.

364
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,802
What is wrong with you?!

365
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,987
I can't do this, okay?

366
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:27,422
I was raised as a boy.

367
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:28,924
I don't get along with women.

368
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,726
Can we just drop it?

369
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:33,061
Okay, I never thought
I'd take a page

370
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:35,797
out of your fiancé's
playbook, but...

371
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,768
it's time to target
the crying chick.

372
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:44,322
Not weird at all.

373
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,024
Marshall,

374
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:47,609
why are we
doing this?!

375
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:50,195
Two dudes on a beach
with a lifeless blob

376
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:51,813
they're pretending
is alive?

377
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:53,031
It's stupid.

378
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,199
So, I guess that means

379
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,501
<i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>
is stupid, too.

380
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:58,453
E-Lawyered.

381
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:00,288
Now, before

382
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,506
I can render a decision,

383
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:03,158
we need to recreate
the variables

384
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,377
at the carousel
as closely as possible.

385
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,630
Since Ted says
that he was comforting Robin,

386
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:09,831
he needs to do

387
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,919
the same for Barney,
so, Ted, comfort Barney.

388
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:15,687
I don't see how that...

389
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,639
Comfort... Barney.

390
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,111
Barney, what is
going on with you?

391
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:25,514
Why are you
so upset with me?

392
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:28,283
Marshall, this is stupid!
I don't...

393
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:29,985
Accept the comfort.

394
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:32,404
Fine!

395
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:36,741
I guess... I'm not
really mad at you.

396
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:38,910
I'm mad at myself.
I should have met Robin

397
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:40,829
at the carousel when she called,

398
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:44,032
but I was having such a good
time greasing 12-year-olds.

399
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,000
Laser tag.

400
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,219
Helpful. Continue.

401
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:51,706
Look, Ted, I'm sorry that
I've been taking it out on you.

402
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,192
You were just being
a good friend to Robin.

403
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:56,511
It's okay.

404
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:58,930
It would be different if
you still had feelings for her,

405
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:01,066
but you don't, right?

406
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,270
Right?

407
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:12,928
Okay, now it's weird.

408
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:19,020
You still have
feelings for Robin?!

409
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:22,407
What?! What?! What?! What?!

410
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,042
Okay, yes, sometimes I do.

411
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,477
Well, then, turn 'em off!

412
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:27,512
I would love to,
but it doesn't work that way!

413
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:30,482
I'm a... I'm a human being.
I-I-I don't have an off switch.

414
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:32,651
I'm shutting off.

415
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,371
There, there.

416
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:38,373
Sister?

417
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,493
Who needs a lady hug?

418
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:43,545
Ugh! What the hell
are you doing?!

419
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,064
Wait. Did you just
"ugh" my hug?

420
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,165
I don't need a hug.

421
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,249
I'm pissed off because

422
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:50,885
the Rangers just lost
to the Boston Bruins.

423
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:53,204
I hate the Boston Bruins!

424
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,843
Look, Barney,
I hate these feelings.

425
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,812
I hate myself
for having these feelings.

426
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:03,598
No one wishes they would go away
more than I do,

427
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,935
but I just... I... I can't seem
to make that happen. I've tried.

428
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:08,386
Well, then, try harder!

429
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,405
I'm marrying her
in less than two days!

430
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:13,024
What the hell are we gonna do
about this?!

431
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:18,196
<i>As she watched Robin make</i>
<i>a new friend, Lily was happy...</i>

432
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:21,366
<i>for two seconds.</i>

433
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:23,168
Oh, no!
Oh, come on, ref!

434
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,086
I haven't seen that much
hooking go unpunished

435
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:26,838
since my last
trip to Vegas.

436
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,708
And I was on that trip,
because we are best friends now.

437
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,711
Hey,

438
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:34,896
this might sound
a little nutty, but

439
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:37,248
how about
we inject a sexual edge

440
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,633
into our abiding friendship
that...

441
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:42,270
...in no way jeopardizes
our emotional connection,

442
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:44,189
or respective marriages?!

443
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,441
<i>Aw!</i>

444
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:47,425
<i>Hell,</i> no!

445
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:49,477
Excuse me.

446
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:52,447
I've got a Boston Brewin',
if you know what I mean.

447
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,368
You listen, and you listen good.

448
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,286
If I see your face
around Robin again,

449
00:17:58,288 --> 00:18:00,205
you will be crying
about a lot more

450
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:02,207
than your precious
New York Rogers.

451
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,958
Rangers?
I will cut you!

452
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:11,383
Forgot my purse.

453
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:14,969
You know what?

454
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:16,921
That's why I only need you.

455
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,807
'Cause you're a psycho.

456
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,742
My psycho.

457
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:23,595
I am, aren't I?
Mm-hmm.

458
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:28,083
There's the blushing bride!

459
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,151
Back off, Patrice!

460
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:35,973
Look, Barney, the truth is,
it was weird at the carousel.

461
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,325
On some level,
it's probably been weird

462
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,327
between me and Robin
ever since we broke up.

463
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:40,412
But you're my brother.

464
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:41,579
I would never do anything

465
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:42,947
to hurt you, ever.

466
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,666
I mean it, I swear!

467
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,984
I'll-I'll even swear it
on the Bro Code.

468
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,086
The Bro Code's stupid.

469
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,987
How dare you!

470
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,757
I'd be honored.

471
00:18:57,713 --> 00:19:01,216
I can't promise that I'll ever
get to a place where it won't be

472
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:03,551
at least a little weird
between me and Robin.

473
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:07,272
But I don't want to lose you
as a friend, either of you.

474
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,308
So I will do everything I can

475
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,977
to move on and live with it.

476
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:17,348
The question is... can you?

477
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:25,206
I'm sorry, Ted.
I just... can't do this.

478
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,859
I fold.

479
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:31,379
What about the best man?

480
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:36,468
I fold, too.

481
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,253
I fold.

482
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,537
There goes my belly buster.

483
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,889
You sandbag all night,

484
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,374
only to bluff a couple
of rags, pre-flop,

485
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,093
and wind up
with a dry board.

486
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:46,327
That's what you get

487
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:49,731
for limping in shorts-tacked
with a pack of donkeys.

488
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,850
Muck city.

489
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,153
I fold!

490
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,387
Yeah...
Oh, right. I knew that.

491
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:58,022
I knew that, I knew that,
I knew that.

492
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,324
Okay, two
players left.

493
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,582
You are bluffing, robot man.

494
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:09,200
I raise.

495
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:10,869
Oh.

496
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,904
Hey, Billy, do you mind

497
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:16,341
pushing my chips
into the center of the pot?

498
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:19,627
Preferably with gusto,
because...

499
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,863
I'm all in!

500
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:23,915
Oh!
Oh, boy!

501
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,184
- All right, all right.
- Oh!

502
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:32,273
<i>And that's how I became</i>
<i>Barney's best man again.</i>

503
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:35,810
<i>Everything was back</i>
<i>to going off without a hitch.</i>

504
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:38,863
I'm coming for you, Mosby.

505
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,982
<i>Okay, there was one</i>
<i>slight hitch.</i>
