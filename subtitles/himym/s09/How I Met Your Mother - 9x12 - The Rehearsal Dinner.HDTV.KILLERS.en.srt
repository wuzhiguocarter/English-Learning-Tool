1
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:07,017
"Let's get this party started."

2
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:09,686
Hey, can you
push the button?

3
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:11,455
Do not touch
that button.

4
00:00:11,457 --> 00:00:13,523
Just give it a little push.
Don't push it.

5
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:14,808
Just push it a little.
Don't listen to him.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,059
Half of it, halfway, halfway...
Don't even touch it.

7
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:17,561
Why can't I
push the button?

8
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:19,596
Because whenever Barney
sees a button-- any button--

9
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:21,231
as to push it.

10
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:25,435
Sorry.

11
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:27,054
Why are you so mad?

12
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:29,272
Because my rehearsal dinner

13
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,408
was supposed to start
ten minutes ago.

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,777
But instead of stuffing my face

15
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,212
with hors d'oeuvres

16
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:37,330
that I have been dreaming
about for months,

17
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:39,750
I am in a laser tag

18
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:41,501
security office,

19
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:44,921
waiting for the police
to arrest my fiancé

20
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,556
for causing a disturbance.

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:47,758
Hey, you said "fiancé."

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,426
That's a good sign.

23
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:50,894
Now what do you say
we give that old button a push?

24
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:53,430
Take a good look at
this face, Barney, okay?

25
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,233
'Cause it'll be useful
for the future.

26
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:58,935
This is my "pretty mad" face.

27
00:00:58,937 --> 00:01:00,737
Well, then, we've got a problem.

28
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,690
'Cause it looks a lot like
your "pretty hungry" face.

29
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:05,275
I'm missing
the bacon-wrapped figs!

30
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:07,143
Please push the button!

31
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:11,168

33
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:21,792
Why is it
so cold in here?

34
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:23,510
You trying to get me to talk
or something?

35
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:24,678
Not really.

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,213
In fact, if you could just
sit there quietly...

37
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:27,714
Fine, I'll talk.

38
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:29,683
It all started a few months ago,

39
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:32,936
when I had the most
awesome idea ever.

40
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:35,722
Laser tag
rehearsal dinner!

41
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:37,724
That might be the worst idea
you've ever had,

42
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:38,859
which is saying a lot.

43
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:41,278
Name one bad idea
I've ever had.

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,113
Gluten-free edible panties.

45
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,364
Hot dog on a stick
on a bun.

46
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,966
Inflatable sex toy life raft.

47
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,367
The breast
augmentation channel.

48
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,035
Single malt
Scotch tape.

49
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:50,070
The time you ran for mayor.

50
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:51,688
I still have 12,000 buttons
that say,

51
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,790
"The only poll I care about
is in my pants."

52
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:56,326
Barney, planning
a wedding

53
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:57,828
is all about compromise.

54
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,129
Do you remember that one night,

55
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,714
right after we got engaged?

56
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,516
Where is this wedding
gonna be, anyway?

57
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,669
You know, I thought it might be
nice to get married in Canada.

58
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,387
I mean, it's where
I'm from, and...

59
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,489
Okay.

60
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:11,424
Let's have it.
Get it over with,

61
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:12,509
get it all out
of your system.

62
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:13,477
I'm the groom,

63
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,845
I'm the groom,
I might as well start.

64
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:16,563
Canada?
What, are we gonna

65
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,682
walk down the aisle to
Crash Test Dummies?

66
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:19,883
Play's to Marshall.

67
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:21,351
Canada?
What are you gonna do,

68
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:23,520
hire a regular dog sled
or a stretch?

69
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,021
Canada?

70
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:26,857
Are you registered
at Tim Hortons?

71
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:27,774
Canada.

72
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,392
Oh, does
the organist play

73
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,527
wearing mittens?

74
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:32,028
Canada? How are you gonna

75
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,246
slip the ring on
the bride's finger

76
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:34,564
if she's wearing
mittens?

77
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,000
Two mitten jokes
in a row?

78
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:39,286
So... you're pretty
much done, then?

79
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,538
Kids... we weren't even close.

80
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,756
Canada.

81
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,374
What do we ask on
the wedding invitation?

82
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,127
"Will you be having
the elk or the moose?"

83
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,211
Canada.

84
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,096
What, are you gonna
walk down the aisle

85
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:51,381
wearing snowshoes?!

86
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:53,767
Canada.

87
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,886
What, is everyone gonna have
access to universal healthcare

88
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:58,021
so no one has to choose
between going bankrupt

89
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:00,607
and treating
a life-threatening illness?

90
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:01,925
Canada?

91
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,793
W-What's the band gonna play
for your first dance?

92
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,245
Crash Test Dummies?

93
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:06,763
See, it's funny

94
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:08,164
'cause who gets a band?

95
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,066
Enough.
It was just an idea.

96
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,201
Okay, okay.

97
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:12,936
Seriously, Robin,
doing it here in New York

98
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,988
would be easier, since
all of our friends

99
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,623
and a lot of
our family are here.

100
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,076
But... I want you to have the wedding
that you want.

101
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:21,795
So if it's Canada...

102
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,330
just say the word.

103
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,299
And then say it again
in French.

104
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:29,920
See? I compromised.

105
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,171
Fine.

106
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:33,790
We'll just have a nice,
tasteful rehearsal dinner.

107
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,593
Maybe at a French restaurant.

108
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:37,928
I know just the place.

109
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,763
What's the name
of the restaurant?

110
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:42,933
La... ser tag.

111
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,352
You know, I was thinking about

112
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:47,136
what to get you guys
for a wedding gift.

113
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:48,271
As you know,

114
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:50,407
I'm kind of
the wedding gift master.

115
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,442
And, well,
all this talk

116
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:53,410
of the rehearsal dinner

117
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:55,195
gives me a fantastic idea.

118
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:56,363
I've been
meaning

119
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:58,665
to start taking
piano lessons again.

120
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,749
No.

121
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:00,817
No piano time.
Guys!

122
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,002
Just let me perform something.

123
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,453
I'll-I'll tickle the keys.

124
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:04,421
It'll be great.

125
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,706
Not even if you
dressed up as Liberace.

126
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,174
What if I dressed up
as Liberace?

127
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,158
Sold!
Sold.

128
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,545
And that was the end of it.

129
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,163
Until my bachelor party.

130
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:15,348
Uh-oh.

131
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,566
Let me guess:

132
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,934
there was a stripper.

133
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,169
You had a little fun.

134
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,806
Maybe took some
ill-advised pictures.

135
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:23,890
Next thing
you know,

136
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,942
she's blackmailing you
into bankruptcy,

137
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,360
and your medical degree's
hanging on the wall

138
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,813
of a laser tag security office!

139
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,949
No.

140
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,818
The night of my bachelor party,
<i>my friends took me</i>

141
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,152
<i>to a crappy hotel,</i>

142
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,988
<i>hired my ex-fiancée</i>
<i>to be the stripper,</i>

143
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,856
<i>I lost thousands of dollars,</i>
<i>and my best friend</i>

144
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:40,857
<i>even had his hand cut off.</i>

145
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:41,858
<i>It would've been</i>

146
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,076
<i>the worst night of all time</i>

147
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,360
if the whole thing hadn't been

148
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,462
<i>a prank planned by</i>

149
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,414
my beautiful, amazing fiancée.

150
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,833
<i>She put me through hell</i>
<i>just to give me the best</i>

151
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:52,218
<i>surprise of my life...which,</i>
<i>p.s.,included an appearance</i>

152
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,420
<i>by my favorite actor--</i>

153
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,505
<i>non-porn category.</i>

154
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,707
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.

155
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,576
Yeah. Except
pretty not cool,

156
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,761
because he kept talking about
how he was gonna get me back,

157
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,097
and sure enough,
a few days later...

158
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,733
Robin, there's no
good way to say this.

159
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,019
I've made a huge mistake.

160
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,820
I can't go through
with the wedding.

161
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,489
What?

162
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,690
I'm so sorry.

163
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,492
I-I just...
I had to tell you

164
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:17,193
before it was too late.

165
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,496
Oh, my God, you're serious.

166
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:20,396
Yeah.

167
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,232
And since this is my apartment,

168
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,168
I think that
you should move out.

169
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,756
Fine.

170
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,410
Puppies!

171
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,465
I know.
Great prank, right?

172
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,083
That is awful.

173
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,751
You're a frickin' weirdo.

174
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,771
Such a weirdo.

175
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,139
Careful, watch the robe.

176
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,774
Anyway,

177
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,776
for reasons only
you guys and Robin

178
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:51,861
but nobody normal
like me would understand,

179
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,262
she got cranky.

180
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:55,148
And she laid
down the law.

181
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,566
No more surprises.

182
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,318
But you love surprises.

183
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,237
Almost as much as
I love lickin' myself!

184
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,106
That was me talking,
not the puppy.

185
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,457
Barney, the surprises
are out of hand

186
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,408
and they have to stop.

187
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,960
Deal?
But...

188
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:07,911
Deal?
But...

189
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,046
Deal.
Butt...

190
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:10,780
Barney...

191
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,133
Fine.

192
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,617
Deal.

193
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:16,469
Man.

194
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,421
This whole "no more
surprises" thing

195
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:20,123
is so unfair.

196
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,141
Who does that?

197
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,476
Barney,
the "no more surprises" thing

198
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:25,261
is the best part
of being married.

199
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:26,796
It's true. When I wake up
in the morning,

200
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:29,298
I know what Lily's breath
is gonna smell like.

201
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,984
It's like...
roses.

202
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,019
Do you really
want a marriage

203
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,187
where you have
this paranoia

204
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:36,156
that Robin's hiding
around every corner,

205
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:38,608
planning to get you back
with some crazy new prank?

206
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,527
You're
absolutely right.

207
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:41,528
Thank you, Lily.

208
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,613
No, th... 
that was me, over here.

209
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,497
He wasn't listening.

210
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:45,782
If you guys
are saying

211
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:46,916
what I think
you're saying...

212
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,118
Probably not.
Go on.

213
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,152
...then that
must mean...

214
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,153
No, it doesn't.

215
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,455
...that Robin is
planning a surprise

216
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,841
laser tag
rehearsal dinner!

217
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,385
Dude, Robin is not planning

218
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,386
a surprise laser tag
rehearsal dinner.

219
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,337
Yes, she is.

220
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,138
No, she isn't.
Yes, she is.

221
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,773
No, I'm not!

222
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:07,975
Yes, she is.

223
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:09,743
No, she isn't.

224
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,411
Then why did
she pretend

225
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,513
to ridicule it
as an idiotic idea?

226
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:16,683
Because it is
an idiotic idea.

227
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,485
If Robin
actually was

228
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:19,987
planning a surprise,

229
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,055
don't you think she would
tell her maid of honor?

230
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,941
She didn't tell you
'cause you can keep a secret

231
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,826
the way my dentist
keeps his car keys.

232
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:30,563
You don't know him,
but he's lost them...

233
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,665
like, twice.

234
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,899
Actually,
just once, and...

235
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,002
that time they were
in his other pocket.

236
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,204
I can't keep a secret?

237
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,538
He does have a point, Lily.

238
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,240
You're kind of famous for
the old blabbity-blabbity.

239
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,375
Hey.

240
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,593
How was lunch
with Debbie?

241
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,211
Great.
She's pregnant!

242
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,262
Oops.

243
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,097
I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
Why not?

244
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,765
Because she's getting
a divorce.

245
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:49,916
Damn it!

246
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,084
Debbie's getting
a divorce?

247
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,804
Yeah, she walked in
on her husband having sex.

248
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,022
Oh! Come on, Lily.

249
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,773
Well, maybe we don't
need to know every gory...

250
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:57,891
With a man.

251
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:00,727
Will you get it
together, Aldrin?!

252
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:01,895
You okay, Lily?

253
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,597
And that guy's
the father of the baby.

254
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,867
I gotta go lie down.

255
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,987
Which brings us
to earlier today,

256
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,956
when Robin was setting up
the decoy rehearsal dinner,

257
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,875
complete with fake booze.

258
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:18,378
Trying to pass
this off as Scotch,

259
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,631
and we all know
it's apple juice.

260
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:29,122
Typical apple juice burn.

261
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:32,259
Yes, Barney,
the booze is real.

262
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,560
The food is real.

263
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:35,896
Ooh, speaking of which,
where are the bacon-wrapped figs?

264
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,681
Probably at...

265
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,965
...the laser tag place,

266
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,268
where the real rehearsal
dinner's going down.

267
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,438
Isn't that right,
Theodore?

268
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,857
Barney, there is
no laser tag.

269
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,108
We're gonna have
a nice dinner,

270
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,526
some drinks,
and then,

271
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,527
according to Robin,

272
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,079
if her Aunt Edith
gets drunk enough,

273
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,813
she'll take off her wig and
they'll play hockey with it.

274
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:54,915
Poppycock!

275
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,000
You know how
she's gonna do it,

276
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,085
and you're gonna
tell me!

277
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,288
Or do I have
to get my face

278
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,657
even closer
to yours?

279
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:05,658
Hey.

280
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,927
How come you're
not getting

281
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,495
uncomfortably
close to my face?

282
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,997
I could be in on it, too.

283
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,833
'Course you could,
Lil.

284
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,469
I can keep a secret.

285
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,887
Lily, don't
make me laugh.

286
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,271
I'd trust you
with a secret

287
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:20,190
as much as I'd trust
Marshall with Pop Secret.

288
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,342
I can keep a secret!

289
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,394
I can keep a secret
real good.

290
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,730
I can keep a secret
like nobody's business,

291
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,682
'cause it is
nobody's business.

292
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:30,951
'Cause it's a secret,

293
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,685
and I'm keeping it!

294
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:33,653
Does Marshall
shave his back?

295
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,688
No, I shave it
for him. Damn it!

296
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,689
Ooh!

297
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,041
I should call
Marshall.

298
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,576
I bet he's
in on this.

299
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,694
If he really exists.

300
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:44,364
Okay.

301
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,632
Setting aside the fact

302
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:46,833
that I've kept your whole

303
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:49,136
"moving to Chicago" thing
a secret,

304
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:52,038
aren't you supposed to be
dressed like Liberace right now?

305
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,590
Okay, first of all,

306
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,225
if I showed up in costume,

307
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,010
it would steal from
the surprise and spectacle

308
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,395
of my grand entrance.

309
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,180
And second of all,
I'm not doing that.

310
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,348
Why not?

311
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,717
Because dressing like Liberace
is easy, but...

312
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:08,388
Uh, yes, 4/4, E-sharp...

313
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,724
major...

314
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:13,443
Okay.

315
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:16,947
Let's make something
beautiful, shall we?

316
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,401
I think that's
enough for today.

317
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:25,505
Okay, I figured out how
this is gonna go down.

318
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,924
We're gonna "run out" of ice,

319
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,909
and Robin's gonna ask me
to go get some,

320
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:32,512
and lo and behold,
the only place that sells ice

321
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:36,550
in this whole town is right next
to the local laser taggery.

322
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,218
I go inside and...

323
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,352
Surprise!

324
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,721
Beautiful dinner,
family and friends,

325
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,224
free game tokens
and an off-road arcade game

326
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,226
that's rigged
for unlimited turbos!

327
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,145
That is the
single stupidest...

328
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,563
Guys, you aren't
gonna believe this.

329
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,782
The ice machine
is broken.

330
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,733
Is it now?

331
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:57,537
Well, dog my cats,
what are the chances?

332
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,040
Huh? What do we do?

333
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,742
Well, I guess I could go get
some ice.

334
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:03,877
Uh, no,
they'll send someone.

335
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,579
All right, fine.
Twist my arm. I'll do it.

336
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,713
But seriously,
Hmm?

337
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,498
did you get everything set up
over there?

338
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,167
Do you have enough food,
have enough guns?

339
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,752
Did you get a vest extender
for Grandma Stinson? She's...

340
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,222
What are you
talking about?

341
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:19,309
Oh, babe, you're so good
at this. I love it.

342
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,261
All right, I'll see you guys
over there.

343
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,762
I mean, be right back.

344
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:26,566
Barney, Barney, this is
our rehearsal dinner, okay?

345
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:28,268
Do not leave the premises.

346
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,070
Promise me you're not going
anywhere.

347
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,154
Fine.

348
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:31,988
Say it.

349
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,491
Say you promise
you won't leave.

350
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,861
I promise I won't leave.

351
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,996
So I left.
And what do you know,

352
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:44,084
the ice store is right next
to a laser tag place!

353
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,486
No, it isn't!
It's six miles away

354
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,671
in the opposite direction.

355
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,506
And I told you not to go!

356
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,707
Yeah, well, you also told me

357
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,659
didn't want a ring bear
at the wedding.

358
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:53,627
Ring bear-er!

359
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,678
We all know how great

360
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,828
that's gonna be. The point is,

361
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,214
I played along with her plan,

362
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,833
and I acted "natural" so I
wouldn't spoil the surprise.

363
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:03,587
Oh, my goodness!

364
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,388
Laser tag?!

365
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,507
Maybe I should go in here
for a minute,

366
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,226
just check it out
for no apparent reason.

367
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,843
And what's this?

368
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:13,346
My hands-free token satchel?

369
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,949
And my free lifetime refill
root beer mug?

370
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,070
So for the past
two months

371
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,122
when we were letting you use
our apartment

372
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:24,023
to practice the piano
every Sunday night,

373
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,408
what were you doing?

374
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,579
Oh, so that's not traveling
'cause he's the MVP?

375
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,365
Come on!

376
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,001
Where's Barney?
Has anyone seen him?

377
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:36,369
Robin, Ted's totally bailing

378
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,338
on playing the piano
for you and Barney.

379
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,975
Oh, really? Ted, you didn't
have to not do that.

380
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,009
But thank you.

381
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,729
But he promised!
A promise is a promise.

382
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,514
You can't say you're
gonna do something

383
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,216
and then suddenly do something
completely different!

384
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,018
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

385
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,822
Because, obviously, I'm worked
up for a different

386
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:56,856
but somewhat similar reason.

387
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,525
And someone should ask me
about it!

388
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,278
I'm sorry. I don't have time
for your drama right now, Lily.

389
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,445
My fiancé is missing.

390
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,331
Marshall got picked
to be a judge.

391
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,533
He took the job
without even asking me.

392
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:09,068
Italy's off!

393
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,588
I have time for your drama.

394
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:21,516
So, Marshall can't go to Italy?
Not if he wants to be a judge.

395
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,907
And my Italian was getting
so good.

396
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,120
It was so.

397
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,792
But wait, you guys already
sublet the apartment.

398
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,661
You're already packed.

399
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:37,380
Marshall already borrowed
and lost my Rosetta Stone.

400
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:39,082
That selfish bastard!

401
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,401
Sorry, Lil. Hello.

402
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,136
Okay, I'm mad, too.

403
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,638
I should hope so.

404
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,123
All of a sudden, his dream
is more important than yours?

405
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,792
And he did it behind your back.

406
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,993
<i>Bastardo!</i>

407
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,761
He would never hurt me
intentionally.

408
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,513
I'll hurt him intentionally.

409
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:54,814
<i>Molto bastardo!</i>

410
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,066
That's sweet of you to say.

411
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,218
You could never take
Marshall in a million years,

412
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,070
but that's sweet of you to say.

413
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,074
Well, apparently, Barney went
to the laser tag place

414
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,743
looking for a surprise
rehearsal dinner.

415
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,062
When he didn't find one,
he threatened

416
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,730
to dunk
the snack bar guy's head

417
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:14,367
into a vat
of scalding nacho Whiz.

418
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,036
He's being held
until the police arrive

419
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,922
I need your apple juice.

420
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:22,676
Ha!

421
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,010
And here we are.

422
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:27,931
Now, I believe this charade
has gone on long enough.

423
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,584
Can we please get to the
surprise laser tag rehearsal?

424
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,137
Hey, there is no surprise
laser tag rehearsal dinner!

425
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,091
Okay, but if I may offer
an opposing view.

426
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,726
Of course there is!

427
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,928
This place is lousy
with clues.

428
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,398
Is he even really
a security guard?

429
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,034
Because he looks an awful lot
like a non-Pakistani version

430
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:51,037
of the guy who delivers
sandwiches at my office.

431
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,706
Also...

432
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:59,612
"laser tag" has the same number
of letters as "rehearsal."

433
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:02,832
Laser tag has eight,
rehearsal has nine.

434
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:07,387
And if you rearrange the letters
and add some other ones,

435
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,641
it says, "Get ready, Barney,
for the biggest surprise ever,

436
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,994
you handsome son of a..."

437
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,462
and then not quite enough
letters for "bitch,"

438
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:17,514
but good try, Robin.

439
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,849
This is crazy, Barney.

440
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,018
We-We can't have a marriage
like this.

441
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,022
A marriage has to be built on
honesty and trust

442
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,408
and all of that Lily-
and-Marshall crap.

443
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,778
I though our marriage was built
on honesty and trust

444
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,198
and all that Lily-
and-Marshal crap.

445
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,917
I just feel so alone right now.

446
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,537
Well, you're not. I'm here.

447
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:44,090
And I know you can keep
a secret.

448
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:46,092
Yeah, right.

449
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:47,344
Tell you what.

450
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,996
How about I let you in
on another secret?

451
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,965
Something bigger.

452
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,967
Bigger than Chicago?

453
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:58,471
Are you kidding?

454
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:01,441
Nope. Want to do the honors?

455
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,846
Ladies and gentlemen,

456
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:10,183
there's been a slight change
of plan.

457
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,118
Fine! Fine.

458
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,570
You're right, Robin.

459
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,406
Marriage isn't about playing
crazy pranks.

460
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,525
It isn't about telling
long expertly crafted lies

461
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:20,627
to cover those pranks...

462
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,412
How'd you get out
of those handcuffs?

463
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,581
...and hiring actors
to play security guards

464
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,167
and spending exorbitant
amounts of money on things

465
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,219
like giant,
fake laser tag signs.

466
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,054
No, it's about honesty.

467
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,173
Size six skate, right?

468
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,224
Yeah.

469
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,594
And in that spirit,
I got to be honest.

470
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,180
Every now and then,

471
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:44,384
I am gonna lie to you.
I just am.

472
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:47,720
If it's in the interest
of an amazing surprise, that is.

473
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:51,991
You're gonna get bamboozled,
hoodwinked.

474
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,444
Heck, I'll just say it.

475
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,163
You're gonna get snowed.

476
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,750
Why is it snowing in here?

477
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:01,918
Put on the skates.

478
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,336
We gotta go.

479
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,121
Where?

480
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,407
Where are we going?

481
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,626
To the rehearsal dinner, silly.

482
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:13,046
Let's get this party started.

483
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:18,017
What?!

484
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,969
Surprise!

485
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:23,273
What-What is going on?

486
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,694
I know how much you wanted
to be in Canada this weekend.

487
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,612
So I brought Canada to you.

488
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:33,099
Oh, and here's an autographed
picture of Wayne Gretzky.

489
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,434
Thanks.

490
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:37,570

a security guard.

there's one more secret

502

All those nights
I was supposed

00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,078

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,833

Holy musk ox, is that legendary
Canadian doctor Frederick Banting?

Whoa!

518
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:10,224

I discovered insulin.

Good to see you.

Hey, look,
it's Louise Poirier,

who I think worked

that probably created
Wonderbra.

Okay, okay.

533
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:40,777
Canadians also helped
win two world wars...

00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:41,456
