You're my best friend, Barney.

00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,026
Good. Then, as your best friend,

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,961
I suggest we play a game
I like to call

4
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,362
Have You Met Ted?

00:00:12,364 --> 00:00:13,664
What? Oh, my God.

00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,232

Happy birthday.

31
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:25,502
W-Where's Max?
He couldn't get a cab.

32
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,688
Which is code for
"waited until the last minute

33
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,172

00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:30,140
Although...

35
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:31,358
he always nails it.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,443
Two years ago,
he got me an exact replica

37
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:35,028
of the <i>Pee-wee's</i>
<i>Big Adventure</i> bike.

38
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,865
And last year, he got me
a one-man band suit

39
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:39,816
including knee cymbals.

40
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:41,568
And these are things you want?

41
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,370
No, these are things I need.

42
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,538
Oh, that's Max.

43
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,873
Uh... I got to take this.

44
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,041
Okay.

45
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,962
Okay, you're officially
super late now...

46
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,752
Yes, this is she.

47
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,376
<i>Okay, this is ridiculous.</i>

48
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,828
You've been sitting
around for two years.

49
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,263
It's time to get
back out there.

50
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:45,966
I have not been sitting around.
I have been hard at work.

51
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:47,784
I think I'm about to enter my

52
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:50,971
"Robots Doing Track
and Field Events" period.

53
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:52,055
It's a very exciting time.

54
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,075
Sweetie.

55
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:56,360
I love you.

56
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,145
And I can't imagine
what it was like

57
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,696
going through what
you went through.

58
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:01,715
But these are your 20s.

59
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,433
It's St. Patrick's Day.

60
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,768
The holiday of my people.

61
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,937
You're not Irish.
Binge drinkers.

62
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,021
Now, let's go.

63
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:09,773
No, please don't
make me go out there.

64
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:10,791
It's gonna rain.

65
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:12,826
Bring your umbrella.

66
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:20,000
How is the bathroom line
this long and yet the floor

67
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:21,785
is covered with urine?
If there's urine out here,

68
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:23,754
what in God's name
is going on in there?

69
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:25,889
Screw this, we're holding it.
Let's go dance.

70
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:26,890
No, thanks.

71
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:29,092
This is what
I'm talking about.

72
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:31,461
The love of your life
could be on that dance floor,

73
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,680
waiting for you
to bump into him.

74
00:03:33,682 --> 00:03:36,149
If you're not there, he's just
gonna bump into someone else.

75
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,435
Somehow I doubt it.

76
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:40,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

77
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:41,421
No, that's okay.

78
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:42,806
I'm going in.

79
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,608
Wait, is that...

80
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,809
Mitch.

81
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:48,328
No way.
Hi.

82
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,080
What are you doing
in New York?

83
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,147
I live here.
What?

84
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,499
Uh, this is my
friend, Kelly.

85
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:53,667
Hey.
Hi.

86
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,585
Mitch was my instructor
at orchestra camp.

87
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:56,670
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Orchestra camp.

88
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:57,788
It's not as lame
as it sounds.

89
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,589
We also did physics, so...
Right.

90
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:02,209
So, Mitch, what are you
up to these days?

91
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,343
I'm still teaching orchestra.

92
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,212
I'm at this public school
up in the Bronx.

93
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:06,430
It's totally underfunded,

94
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:07,831
a lot of the kids
can't afford instruments,

95
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,599
but I really...
Take my cello.

96
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:10,767
What?
Yeah.

97
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,052
Oh, yeah, you
gotta take it.

98
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,136
I haven't played
it in years.

99
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:14,170
It's just sitting
in my closet.

100
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,171
Give it to
one of the kids!

101
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,306
Wow, are you sure?

102
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:17,474
Do you want to come
and get it right now?

103
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:19,059
Um... okay.

104
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,895
Okay, great. Let's go.

105
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:25,315
Okay, yes, you're doing
something nice.

106
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:26,850
But you're still
bailing on me.

107
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:29,986
So I guess, karmically...
it evens out?

108
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:31,738
I'm just worried
about you.

109
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,989
Don't be.

110
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:33,990
Have fun.

111
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,375
And who knows?

112
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:37,694
Maybe you'll bump
into someone tonight.

113
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,496
Oh...

114
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,469
Girl, I will
sham-rock your world.

115
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:49,222
Okay...

116
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:51,675
I'll...

117
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:52,759
We'll...

118
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,895
Okay.

119
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:57,013
<i>Okay, here it is.</i>

120
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:58,899
I haven't played this

121
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,334
since the popular girls
locked me inside the case.

122
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:04,271
Although it was roomier
than when I played the violin...

123
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:05,822
What are you doing?!

124
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,190
I don't know.

125
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:08,224
What am I doing?

126
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,443
I don't know!
What are you doing?!

127
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:10,444
This is my thing...

128
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,895
It most certainly
is your thing.

129
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:12,863
Now, please cover your thing up.

130
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:14,197
Sorry.

131
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,165
I-I meant...

132
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,900
this move.

133
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:18,018
It's my thing.

134
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:19,920
I call it "The Naked Man."

135
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:20,954
A few weeks ago,

136
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:22,873
I was on a date,
and it worked.

137
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,958
And then I was on another date
and it worked again,

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,593
so I figured it would work
all the time.

139
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:28,128
Well, now you know
it doesn't work all the time.

140
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,913
Yeah.

141
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,998
Although two out of three...

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,101
Is this what it's gonna be like?

143
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,753
Being single in New York?

144
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,389
Even the nice guys turn out
to be total creeps?

145
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:43,193
I have gotten pretty creepy
since I moved here.

146
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:46,429
I feel so lost right now.

147
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,431
I don't even know
what I'm doing with my life.

148
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,234
Can I tell you
an embarrassing story?

149
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,486
Is it this one?

150
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:53,820
Taking place right now?

151
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:55,739
I felt lost

152
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:57,741
for a long time, too.

153
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,394
I was living in
my parents' basement.

154
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,964
Playing video games, mastur...

155
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,715
ing those games,

156
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:06,850
until

157
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:08,218
I finally woke up

158
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,138
and realized I wanted
to follow my dream

159
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,672
of teaching music.

160
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,476
Let me save you a few years.

161
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,229
Even if it sound
completely crazy...

162
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:21,431
what is it you want
to do with your life?

163
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:24,968
I want to end poverty.

164
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,403
Great.

165
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,972
Then every decision you make
from here on out

166
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:31,291
should be in service of that.

167
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,410
Wow.

168
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:35,162
Thanks.

169
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:36,580
You know,
for a minute there,

170
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:37,948
I totally forgot
you were naked.

171
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:41,001
In a way...

172
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:42,752
aren't we all naked?

173
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:45,038
Yeah, but your balls
are on my couch.

174
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,842
Hug?
I will take a rain check.

175
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:50,093
It's raining now.

176
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,295
Oh, my umbrella!
Oh! Uh...

177
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,548
I will be
right back.

178
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,765
Um...
long story.

179
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:59,186
Nothing happened,
I swear.

180
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,820
Then why are you naked?

181
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,357
Oh, what the hell?

182
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:08,061
<i>When I got to the club,</i>
<i>it had already closed.</i>

183
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:09,679
<i>By the next day,</i>
<i>some super inconsiderate</i>

184
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,565
<i>person had taken my umbrella.</i>

185
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:14,234
<i>But by that point,</i>
<i>I didn't care.</i>

186
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:16,369
<i>I knew that if I really wanted</i>
<i>to end poverty,</i>

187
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,489
I had to get a degree
in economics.

188
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,241
So...

189
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,542
to answer your question,

190
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:24,077
that's how I got here.

191
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,030
I meant, how did you get here
from the subway station?

192
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:27,600
Oh.

193
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,663
But I'm only asking
'cause I just moved to town.

194
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,201
I don't even have
a place to live yet.

195
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:33,803
Yeah, you do.

196
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:34,888
Come live with me.

197
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,256
My roommate just moved out.

198
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,507
Are you sure?

199
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,475
You just met me.

200
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:39,976
I could be a serial killer.

201
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:41,978
I like to believe in people.

202
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,632
Plus, what are the chances
that we're both serial killers?

203
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:48,018
Just promise me there won't be

204
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,402
any naked men
in the living room.

205
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:50,687
Not a problem.

206
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:54,024
I'm on permanent hiatus
in the love department.

207
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:55,025
Really?

208
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,326
I find that hard to believe.

209
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:57,727
I guess I'm
old-fashioned.

210
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,864
I believe that each of us
only gets one.

211
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,617
And I got mine already.

212
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:04,918
Well, if you ask me,

213
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,037
you know what comes
after the one?

214
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,071
The next one.

215
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,422
Oh, yeah.

216
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:11,458
Well, I don't really
see that happening

217
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,877
any time soon.

218
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,178
Hi.

219
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,513
Is this room seven?

220
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,919
And so, if you must bring food
to this class,

221
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,971
please bring enough
for everyone.

222
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,906
I don't want to see someone

223
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,142
eating, say, lobster,
in the front row

224
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,461
without sharing
with the rest of of us.

225
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:33,928
Because that...

226
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,032
would be shellfish.

227
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,371
Come on,
that was funny.

228
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,323
Anyway...
...this is Architecture 101.

229
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,658
Architecture 101?

230
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,727
Oh, no, I'm in the wrong class!
I have to go!

231
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,330
Oh, sorry.

232
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,381
Um...

233
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:54,783
Oh, God.

234
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,151
Wait, I was in the right class.

235
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,753
First day as a professor,
wrong classroom, coming through!

236
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,176
<i>You play bass?</i>

237
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:05,894
Seriously,
ask my friends.

238
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:06,895
I always say

239
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,180
my ideal woman...

240
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,131
...does not play bass,

241
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,350
because this is clearly
your roommate's.

242
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,518
She's in a band.

243
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,969
Damn, that's cool.

244
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,238
This is unbelievable.

245
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
You just picked out
the only three things in here

246
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:19,491
that are my roommate's.

247
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,526
So does your roommate's band
ever play shows or...

248
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,412
Get out.
All right.

249
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,002
Okay, this is crazy.

250
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,588
Do you know where this
umbrella came from?

251
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,972
Because I could've
sworn that I...

252
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,325
What's wrong?

253
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,476
Are you okay?

254
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:55,861
We broke up.

255
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,480
Oh... well,
I never liked him,

256
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,116
and I never thought
he deserved you, and...

257
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,184
I am sorry, I didn't know
you were dating someone.

258
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,119
Who was this?

259
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,655
He was the architecture
professor.

260
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:09,357
The one who taught
Econ 305 by accident.

261
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,858
Oh.

262
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,160
That guy?

263
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,712
Why did you break up?

264
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,247
He's got a thing for you.

265
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,531
What?

266
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,699
Yeah, what?

267
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,033
He's... what?

268
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,419
How... um, how could
he have a thing for me?

269
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,721
He's never even met me.

270
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,038
He didn't have to.

271
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,341
Everything he saw of yours,
he went crazy for.

272
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:28,510
You should've brought
him to my room.

273
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:30,312
Okay? He would've
run screaming

274
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:31,930
once he saw my
calligraphy set,

275
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,098
my coin collection,

276
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,067
my chain-mail corset
from the Renaissance Faire.

277
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,019
Well, that's pretty cool.

278
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:39,104
Come on.

279
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,822
How could he not
be in love with you?

280
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:42,890
The way you
fall asleep on the couch

281
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,025
when you're doing the crossword.

282
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,660
When did he see me
fall asleep on...

283
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:47,061
The way your hair smells.

284
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,798
The way your eyes sparkle.

285
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,739
I might have some stuff
to figure out.

286
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,375
You might.
I'm so sorry!

287
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:02,294
No, uh, it's okay.

288
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,745
It was nice.

289
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,048
I haven't been kissed
in a really long time.

290
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,968
<i>Not long after that,</i>
<i>she met a nice girl</i>

291
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,853
<i>and they fell in love,</i>

292
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:14,856
so it's a happy ending--
for Cindy anyway.

293
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:17,359
I, however, am left
without a roommate,

294
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,561
so here we are.

295
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,230
I have a confession.

296
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:24,532
Uh, I don't need
a place to live.

297
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,818
I saw your ad for the
roommate, and I just...

298
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,620
I-I really wanted to meet you.

299
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:32,707
I-I'm a huge fan of your
band SuperFreakonomics.

300
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,292
Oh, my gosh, really?

301
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,127
Really, come
I to all your shows,

302
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,463
and I'm not just saying this--
I think you guys are

303
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,949
the best economic-themed band
in the entire city.

304
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,085
Even better
than Radiohedge Fund?

305
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,337
Oh, absolutely.

306
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,773
I wish I had the guts
to do what you do.

307
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,478
I love to sing, but...

308
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,263
You know what?

309
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:58,966
Next time we do a show, you have
got to come up onstage with us

310
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,934
and sing a song.

311
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,853
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Mm-hmm.

312
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,639
No, I'm, I'm, I'm too shy.

313
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:08,643
♪ But maybe just one song!

314
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,478
♪ Yeah!

315
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,616
I mean, I don't like to think
of SuperFreakonomics as my band.

316
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:16,584
I think of it as my canvas

317
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:19,487
upon which I paint
my masterpieces.

318
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,375
And that right there is
why I don't play bass.

319
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:28,930
Can I help you
with that?

320
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:32,801
Uh, wow, thanks, Superman.

321
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,769
No problem.

322
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:35,670
It's either help you

323
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,389
or stop a train
from going off a cliff,

324
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,773
and you're much cuter.

325
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,008
Can I buy you a drink?

326
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,495
Oh, no, sorry, I'm 16.

327
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,315
Oh, wow, sorry.

328
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,516
Have a good night.

329
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,951
Wait, you believe that?

330
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:51,820
I like you.

331
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,322
Uh, sure,
you can buy me a drink.

332
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:55,890
MacLaren's.

333
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:56,841
The last time I was here,

334
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,676
I thought this place
was called Puzzles.

335
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,078
That's an odd name.

336
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,963
Why would you call a bar
Puzzles?

337
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,716
Unless that's the puzzle.

338
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,917
Well, um,

339
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,470
thank you for the drink.

340
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:11,222
Uh, so, do you want
to get dinner sometime?

341
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,425
Um...

342
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,729
Louis, you're really nice,
but...

343
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,899
I was in love with somebody
a long time ago,

344
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,817
and he died.

345
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,269
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

346
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,739
Uh, it's silly, but...

347
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:31,893
it's like the first lottery
ticket I ever bought was...

348
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:36,114
kaboom, jackpot, and I'm pretty
sure I'm not going to win again,

349
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,449
not like that anyway,

350
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,453
so I don't generally buy
lottery tickets anymore.

351
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:42,620
I understand.

352
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,739
So I should... go.

353
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,009
Well, if you
change your mind...

354
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,745
...give me a call.

355
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,180
Okay.

356
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:02,440
Okay, <i>now</i> we're even!

357
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,225
What?!
What?!

358
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:06,694
So we got dinner.
And?

359
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,031
He's... nice.

360
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,867
Nice? He sounds amazing!

361
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,769
Handsome, good dresser,
paid for dinner.

362
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,103
What more do you want?

363
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,105
Do you know how rough
it is out there?

364
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,441
I once met a guy claiming
to be a genie

365
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,076
whose penis grants wishes.

366
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,163
Oh, my God,
who would even fall for that?

367
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,582
The point is,
Louis sounds great.

368
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:30,451
<i>And that's how your mom</i>
<i>started dating Louis.</i>

369
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,120
<i>And for a couple years,</i>
<i>it was fun.</i>

370
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,974
♪ One tasty English muffin

371
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,593
♪ Baby, that is what I am

372
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:39,644
♪ Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da

373
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,514
♪ One tasty English muffin

374
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:47,268
♪ With some raspberry jam.

375
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,103
That's funny.

376
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,357
<i>It just wasn't love.</i>

377
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,809
<i>But then fate intervened.</i>

378
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,028
Anyway, you guys wouldn't, uh,
happen to know of any

379
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,581
good wedding bands available
at the last minute, would you?

380
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,619
Hi. One ticket
to Farhampton, please.

381
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,172
<i>Now, Louis had a beach house</i>
<i>out in Farhampton,</i>

382
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,706
<i>so he let your mother</i>
<i>stay there.</i>

383
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,758
<i>The day before the wedding,</i>
<i>as she was taking</i>

384
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,927
<i>some cookies out of the oven,</i>
<i>she got an e-mail.</i>

385
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:15,880
What the damn hell?!

386
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,666
"Bass player wanted,"
that is what the ad said.

387
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,518
Can you believe that?

388
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,822
After I'm the one who invited
Darren into the band.

389
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,107
What am I gonna do?

390
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:29,477
You need to steal
this douche monkey's van.

391
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,981
Then run my husband over
with it.

392
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,983
Well, that's very tempting.

393
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:37,318
I've never really been
the type of person to...

394
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,671
"Must be hotter
than the girl we have now,

395
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,407
who, in my opinion,
is a six at best"?

396
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:49,747
Aw, geez, what is this
knucklehead doing?

397
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,587
Excuse me! Hey!

398
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,255
You guys need a lift?

399
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,890
<i>The best man just punched me</i>

400
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,475
<i>in the face for no reason.</i>

401
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:01,476
You know what? I quit.

402
00:16:01,478 --> 00:16:03,094
You can have
your stupid band back.

403
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,982
Linus, whoever that best man is,

404
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:11,736
I would like to buy him
a double of your finest scotch.

405
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,364
Louis!

406
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,555
Will you marry me?

407
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:39,939
Can you give me a minute?
Um... okay.

408
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,724
There's someone
that I need to talk to.

409
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,061
I'll-I'll be right back.

410
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,692
Hi, Max. It's me.

411
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:02,294
Sorry to interrupt.

412
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:05,480
I know you're probably up there
playing baseball with your dad.

413
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:10,619
Um, look, I-I've got
a situation here.

414
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:15,207
I think that I have been
holding myself back

415
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,510
from falling in love again.

416
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:23,298
And I think it's because
I can't let you go.

417
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,251
But you're not here anymore...

418
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:31,056
so I have to ask this:

419
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:35,727
Would it be okay
if I moved on?

420
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:40,949
I realize that you have no way
of answering that,

421
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,284
but, um...

422
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,152
Oh, okay...

423
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:47,772
I will take that as yes.

424
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:51,910
Um, in that case,
I should get back in there.

425
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,620
I guess this is it.

426
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,506
For real this time.

427
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:09,177
Bye, Max.

428
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:26,862
So?

429
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,372
My answer is...

430
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:39,074
no.

431
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,223
<i>You're in luck.</i>

432
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,059
Mother of the bride
never checked in.

433
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,977
How many keys
will you be needing?

434
00:18:58,979 --> 00:18:59,945
Just one.

435
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:01,346
Yeah.
I just...

436
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,032
I broke up with someone.

437
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,773
I think room number six
is the room for you.

438
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,191

00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:27,992
<i>of "La Vie en Rose"</i>
<i>a million times over the years.</i>

456
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:30,262

457

Wow.

Barney, I was just out there
on the patio...

462
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:49,016
and there's someone
in the room next to us.

463
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:50,484
I didn't see her, but...

464
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:52,235
Well, she was playing
the ukulele...

465
00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:59,760
Barney?
