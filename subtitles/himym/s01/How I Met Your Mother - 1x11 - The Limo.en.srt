1
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:17,491
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.

2
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,159
Sure, it looks great on TV,

3
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:21,644
but in reality, it's always just a big let down,

4
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,838
but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible,

5
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,806
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.

6
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:28,580
I had an idea of how to do it, too.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,304
And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,548
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.

9
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,802
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.

10
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,840
Okay, people, let's talk strategy.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,060
Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,843
This year we party together or not at all.

13
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:01,876
Now, I sifted through your party submissions

14
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:03,819
and I narrowed them down to these five.

15
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:04,444
Question?

16
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,978
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no,

17
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,442
we will not be attending any parties in your pants.

18
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:12,165
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?

19
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:14,348
Thas an actual picture of my pants.

20
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:15,043
Yeah.

21
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:17,310
We will hit all five parties before midnight,

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,937
and then narrow them down to one,

23
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:21,285
the most awesome party in New York City

24
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:25,797
and that is where we will ring,
nay rock, in the new year.

25
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:29,128
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?

26
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:30,180
Mary Beth?

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,862
Oh, she works in my office.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,718
She seems like she might be into me.

29
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,790
She's always finding reasons to hug me.

30
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:37,990
So tonight...

31
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:43,882
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,208
By who ?
Who asks you that?

33
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:49,971
And the answer is right here--

34
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,082
my own, personal "get psyched" mix.

35
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:55,376
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall,

36
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,209
but people are wrong.

37
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:00,148
It should be all rise, baby.

38
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:03,186
Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey

39
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:06,952
into the white-hot center of adrenaline.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,646
Bam.

41
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,318
It's working.

42
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,579
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.

43
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:18,451
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.

44
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,838
Must do robot.

45
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,824
- Let's do this!
- Yes! Let's!

46
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,827
Oh, driver?

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,719
Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now.

48
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,784
That's awesome.

49
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:34,790
I've moved up in the world.

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,193
How do you guys know each other?

51
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:40,254
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.

52
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:41,826
Hey, what are we waiting for?

53
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,793
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.

54
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,891
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek

55
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,222
should be coming by any minute to pick me up.

56
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:52,612
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.

57
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:53,591
Derek.

58
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,228
He was like rich, successful, handsome.

59
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:57,773
I hated that guy.

60
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:00,730
Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.

61
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,405
Bye.

62
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,607
See ya next year.

63
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:03,817
Go get 'em.

64
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,567
Well, this kind of sucks.

65
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:10,660
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,967
We're a man down.

67
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,691
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.

68
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:15,863
Ranjit!

69
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:20,372
- Party number one.
- Party number one!

70
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,047
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.

71
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,672
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,742
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.

73
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:35,831
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.

74
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:37,652
We didn't really get a chance to meet.

75
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,859
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.

76
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,376
Hi. Mary Beth.

77
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,484
So great to meet you guys.

78
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:46,693
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.

79
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,848
American party friends of Barney's.

80
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:55,734
Oh, no.

81
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,661
So, Barney, who's your new friend?

82
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,413
Natalya.

83
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,985
Oh, friendly.

84
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:05,814
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She... Who knows?

85
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:08,877
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?

86
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,035
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?

87
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:15,450
Isn't she awesome?

88
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,740
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes,

89
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,482
but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.

90
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:24,815
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?

91
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:28,253
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.

92
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:29,877
I need you to power through the pain.

93
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:33,429
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.

94
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,931
It's true.
I can hear them.

95
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,479
What's that, little boys?
What's that?

96
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
You wanna go for a... rock?

97
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:45,919
- Ranjit! Party number two.
- Party number two.

98
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,132
- Party number two?
- Not so good.

99
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,939
Let's go back to party number one.

100
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,396
No, no turning back.

101
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,330
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three. Yeah.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,696
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.

103
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:05,827
We left Natalya.

104
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:09,703
Barney, none of us really liked her.

105
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,423
- What?!
- Sorry.

106
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,110
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.

107
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:18,789
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,

108
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:22,755
I choose to turn my front on her. What up?

109
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,469
I'm sorry about Barney.

110
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,982
No, I'm having a great time.

111
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,274
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.

112
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,830
Me, too.

113
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,010
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.

114
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:41,774
Pfft. Derek.

115
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,627
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night

116
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:46,044
and I was already on a date with another girl.

117
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,222
But... it was Robin.

118
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:51,129
Ranjit, turn it around.

119
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,147
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.

120
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:04,090
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.

121
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,456
No, this is perfect.

122
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,728
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.

123
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:08,910
What happened?

124
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,558
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.

125
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:13,915
Who works on New Year's Eve?

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,428
Okay.
Now I feel worse.

127
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,471
I was really looking forward to this night.

128
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,942
This sucks.

129
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,388
Oh, dude, not now!

130
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,726
What? She needs to get psyched.

131
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:30,846
Fine.

132
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:33,321
Maybe I should just go home.

133
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:38,008
My finger slipped.

134
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:42,237
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.

135
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:44,026
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?

136
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:46,014
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?

137
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:49,514
Fine. I'll kiss you at... 
a little bit after midnight.

138
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:52,101
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.

139
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,578
You're friendly.

140
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:57,662
I haven't eaten dinner yet.

141
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:59,020
Is there anything to eat in this thing?

142
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,550
That's it. I know what you're jonesing for.

143
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,360
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,662
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.

145
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,923
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,

146
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:10,492
but we do have time for hot dogs?

147
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,035
Yeah, we like hot dogs.

148
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:15,139
No. No. We are already behind schedule.

149
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:15,784
Ted, come on.

150
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:19,359
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.

151
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:22,124
You don't know what you're missing.

152
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:23,981
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.

153
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,119
Which is exactly how much time I need.

154
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,262
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.

155
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,527
Wait. Baby, what are you doing?

156
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,515
- I'm going home.
- What? No!

157
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:36,795
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.

158
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,207
There's a cab over there.

159
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,566
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.

160
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,644
But... hot dogs.

161
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:45,273
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.

162
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,760
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.

163
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,003
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...

164
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,526
- party number three.
- Are you sure?

165
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,772
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.

166
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:58,778
We'll find each other.

167
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,909
We'll find each other.

168
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:03,835
I know we will.

169
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,529
Hell of a woman.

170
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:15,108
Let's go get some hot dogs!

171
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,226
Ranjit, party number three.

172
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:25,180
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!

173
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,596
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.

174
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:28,973
Eating hot dogs.

175
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:30,823
It's like we're the president.

176
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,900
Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.

177
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,943
Oh, so much better.

178
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,014
Guys.

179
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,727
Is that Moby?

180
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:40,384
I think that that's Moby.

181
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:44,555
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.

182
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,317
No way.

183
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,050
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.

184
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:51,645
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?

185
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:54,268
Moby! Hey, Moby!

186
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:55,788
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.

187
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,770
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.

188
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,523
- Hey.
- Hello.

189
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:03,214
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,519
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.

191
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,313
You want a ride?

192
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:11,489
Sure.

193
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,201
Welcome.

194
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,774
- Wow. You're friendly.
- Big fan.

195
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:24,615
Barney Stinson.

196
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:27,822
So, uh... what about this party?

197
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:29,825
It's just a New Year's thing.

198
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:30,971
You know, with some friends.

199
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,912
Wow, that sounds awesome.

200
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,484
You guys want to come?

201
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,909
Yeah, we'd love to.

202
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,580
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.

203
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,256
S idebar?

204
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,730
Um... Moby, switch up, will you?

205
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,157
Yeah, what's up?

206
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,184
- What about Lily?
- Call her.

207
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:57,065
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.

208
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,523
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.

209
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:02,030
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...

210
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,834
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting. I gotta...

211
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,376
I gotta find her.

212
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:08,815
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.

213
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,319
But... Come on!
Moby's party!

214
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,934
Moby's party!
Moby's par...

215
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,851
Ranjit.

216
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,088
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.

217
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,922
This is a cool mix.

218
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:29,475
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.

219
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,271
I think it should be all rise.

220
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:35,593
Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher.

221
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,351
This mix is my pride and joy.

222
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,038
I never leave home without it.

223
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,298
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.

224
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,060
Jan... Aah!

225
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,818
So then I say,

226
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:50,412
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."

227
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,229
You're not Moby, are you?

228
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:00,295
Who?

229
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,469
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.

230
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:05,661
No.

231
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:09,930
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."

232
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:11,898
I thought you said "Tony."

233
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:14,573
So your name is Tony?

234
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,583
No.

235
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:18,801
Oh, hey, we're here.

236
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,023
All right.

237
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:21,910
You guys going to come in?

238
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,826
Nah.

239
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:25,094
You're sure?

240
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,517
Come on. It's going to get nuts in there.

241
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,410
There's this dude who owes me money.

242
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,689
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.

243
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:35,032
Happy New Year, Not Moby.

244
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:43,151
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.

245
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,268
Why did we think that guy was Moby?

246
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:49,123
I don't know.

247
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:52,538
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.

248
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:58,518
That's Marshall's phone.

249
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:03,169
Hello.

250
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:06,013
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.

251
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:10,093
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?

252
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:11,613
He left his phone in the limo.

253
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,764
- He's out looking for you.
- What? Where?

254
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,348
Party number three.

255
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,131
Well, I'm here at party number three and...

256
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:21,717
Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in-- Moby!

257
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,659
Moby?! She's upstairs.

258
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,996
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.

259
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:31,437
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...

260
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,968
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!

261
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,252
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.

262
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:40,483
What are the odds?

263
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:44,550
Who was that guy?!

264
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,733
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.

265
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,920
Ranjit, drive!

266
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,140
- Where to?
- Party number three!

267
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,420
Party number three!

268
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,058
No, but I was just at party number three.

269
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,890
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.

270
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,347
You must have looked at the list wrong.

271
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:02,585
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience,

272
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,362
you know what it's time for?

273
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:08,959
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.

274
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,698
Re-psy...

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,833
Where's the...?

276
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,025
Oh, my God!

277
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:22,710
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!

278
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,556
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!

279
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:26,867
Let it go.

280
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:28,779
We need to get back on schedule.

281
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,201
Ah, nuts.

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,156
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?

283
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:42,311
No.

284
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:43,903
I am pissed.

285
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:46,476
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.

286
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,084
Okay.

287
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,511
Okay, not a problem.

288
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:55,477
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.

289
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:57,863
I wish Marshall would call.

290
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,409
I guess the circuits are jammed.

291
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,026
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed

292
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,641
because everyone's calling their loved ones,

293
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,053
everyone around the world.

294
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,945
Everyone except Barney.

295
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,103
Oh, sure, laugh.

296
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,336
Laugh for Barney Stinson.

297
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:17,013
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel

298
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:20,322
of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.

299
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:22,846
Round and round it goes.

300
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:24,677
And where's it all heading?

301
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,400
Nowhere.

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,496
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?

303
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,226
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?

304
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:36,901
No. No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.

305
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,009
We got to stay psyched.

306
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:43,101
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.

307
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:49,645
"Shot through the heart
And you're to blame, darling"

308
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:54,102
"You give love a bad name
A bad name"

309
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:58,409
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.

310
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:02,665
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"

311
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,453
It'll be fine.

312
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:10,975
We'll be out of here in a jiff.

313
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,322
Ted, I'm going to head out.

314
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:14,979
My roommates are having a party not far from here.

315
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:18,148
No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...

316
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,651
How long have you been in love with Robin?

317
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:22,931
I'm not in love...

318
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,003
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?

319
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:29,085
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.

320
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:32,159
And I can tell that she's into you, too.

321
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,641
That's ridiculous.

322
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,262
Wait. Really?

323
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:38,506
Happy New Year, Ted.

324
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:58,334
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.

325
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,983
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.

326
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,073
It's no big deal.

327
00:16:02,473 --> 00:16:05,167
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.

328
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,780
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.

329
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,680
I suppose, in a way, I still am.

330
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:13,878
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.

331
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:17,277
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.

332
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,546
I'm sorry about your girl.

333
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:25,508
Sorry about your guy.

334
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:28,920
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.

335
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:33,983
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.

336
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:37,449
I did not, too.

337
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,726
D erek.

338
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,261
- Hi. How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.

339
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,366
Okay, how's this for a plan?

340
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,874
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.

341
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,973
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.

342
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:12,120
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?

343
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,765
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is,

344
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,767
which is New Year's Eve which is the single

345
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,460
biggest letdown of a night every single year.

346
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,864
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.

347
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,001
We've still got ten minutes.

348
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:28,792
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.

349
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,633
It doesn't exist.

350
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,930
Holy crap.

351
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,551
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.

352
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,173
So much to tell.

353
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:54,455
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--

354
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,303
I walked to the next party on the list.

355
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,267
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.

356
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,988
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.

357
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:04,972
And guess what I found.

358
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:09,316
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.

359
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:11,185
Yeah, I know.
Come on.

360
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,037
Come on! Oh! Oh!

361
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:18,242
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.

362
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,908
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.

363
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,286
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.

364
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:25,452
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.

365
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:28,615
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.

366
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:32,011
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.

367
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,298
How? We'll never get a cab.

368
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:35,551
The flat's fixed.

369
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,761
Let's do this!
Come on! In!

370
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:39,950
Go, go, go!

371
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,550
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?

372
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,139
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.

373
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,556
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?

374
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:48,755
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.

375
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:51,494
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.

376
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,332
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?

377
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,097
I get you there in six.

378
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,845
I don't think I can do it.

379
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,878
No! Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!

380
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,201
Three minutes!
Come on!

381
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,767
Ranjit, put her in park.

382
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,434
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome,

383
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:18,597
but it's not the best party in New York.

384
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,765
'Cause this is, right here.

385
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:25,758
- Cheers. Well said.
- Cheers. Cheers.

386
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:29,188
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.

387
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:34,204
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down

388
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,676
that was right there in that limo.

389
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,929
Derek?!
Derek.

390
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:47,285
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.

391
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:55,721
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.

392
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,683
I can't believe you made it.

393
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,669
I made it, baby.

394
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,436
I super love you, okay?

395
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,477
Here, you need a mint.

396
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:16,898
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!

397
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:20,684
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.

398
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:21,766
Well, don't.

399
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,154
Not every night has a happy ending.

400
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:25,905
But all of it's important.

401
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,501
All of it was leading somewhere.

402
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,756
Because suddenly, it was 2006.

403
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:34,461
And 2006 was a big one.

404
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,097
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.

405
00:20:44,064 --> 00:20:45,657
What about your guy?

406
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:48,005
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.

407
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:52,251
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.

408
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,466
Well, a deal is a deal.

409
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:09,741
Happy New Year.

410
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,585
Happy New Year.

411
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:30,181
