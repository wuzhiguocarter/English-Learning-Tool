1
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:16,154
So Kids, there are many buildings in New York City.

2
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,101
Thousands of apartments,

3
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:20,166
millions of stories.

4
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:23,777
And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now,

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,099
there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment.

6
00:00:29,784 --> 00:00:32,006
I have so many great memories of that place.

7
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:34,113
Marshall playing video games.

8
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:37,167
Lily painting on the fire escape.

9
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:39,121
Hey!

10
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:41,484
Sorry, Mr. Matson.

11
00:00:42,453 --> 00:00:44,447
And me making the coffee.

12
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,999
I had this coffee pot-- it was probably 50 years old at the time,

13
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,007
and it made truly terrible coffee.

14
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,915
We called it Shocky.

15
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:53,366
Plugging in.

16
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:54,804
Saving game.

17
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,538
I loved every last detail of that place,

18
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:04,870
right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall.

19
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,143
I never wanted any of it to change.

20
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,534
But that's not how life works.

21
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,073
You guys will never believe what just happened to us.

22
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:15,662
I don't even believe it myself.

23
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:19,079
We were in Queens, and we decided to stop by my apartment.

24
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,679
Wait, her apartment?

25
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,169
I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall.

26
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:27,129
I could see how you would think that, but I have to have my own place.

27
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,794
It's an independence thing.

28
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,533
When was the last time you were there?

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,199
Three months ago.

30
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:33,686
What?

31
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,287
It's like fat pants.

32
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,789
You hope you never have to use them, but you're glad to know they're there.

33
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,632
What the hell?

34
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:43,601
What?

35
00:01:44,324 --> 00:01:46,123
This is my apartment.

36
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:47,591
Where?

37
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:49,082
Right here.

38
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:52,747
What the hell?

39
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,973
Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.

40
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:58,469
No, no, this was my apartment.

41
00:01:58,592 --> 00:01:59,874
My dresser was right...

42
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:02,003
That's my dresser!

43
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,389
And this is my closet.

44
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:10,259
And I spilled nail polish there. There's the stain.

45
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:11,970
Hi. How many?

46
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:13,444
Lily.

47
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,194
Yes. You know me?

48
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,964
Yeah. From your homecoming picture.

49
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,433
You're much prettier in person.

50
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,862
Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake.

51
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,483
Where's my stuff?!

52
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,218
Oh, it's all in the back.

53
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,721
We could wrap it up for you.

54
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:30,338
You want it to go?

55
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,752
This is my apartment.

56
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:34,865
Not anymore.

57
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,679
No way. You're making this up.

58
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:40,032
Yeah, the building would have had to give you some kind of notice.

59
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,802
They sent you a notice about this.

60
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:42,624
When?

61
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:44,269
Three months ago.

62
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:45,387
And here's your mail.

63
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,765
Minus magazines.

64
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:51,050
Well, still legally, they can't just toss you out on the street.

65
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,074
You have a lease.

66
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:55,068
Okay, so I didn't have a written lease as such,

67
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:58,579
but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.

68
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,271
She may be 98 years old, but she's still...

69
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,053
She's dead, isn't she?

70
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,992
Never even saw the bus.

71
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:10,991
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant.

72
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,798
What am I going to do?

73
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,547
Come live with us.

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,567
Really?

75
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:16,641
Of course.

76
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,900
You sure about this, Ted?

77
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:20,823
Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway.

78
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,451
It's not like it'll change anything.

79
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,938
No, it's like it will change everything.

80
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,115
Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.

81
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:28,660
What are you talking about?

82
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:31,372
And why is that girl checking you out?

83
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,128
Because I look good.

84
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,155
Now, focus.

85
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,847
You and Marshall are roommates.

86
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,136
You have an amazing apartment.

87
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,110
Marshall and Lily just got engaged.

88
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,046
Yeah, so?

89
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:44,421
So, you're not still going to be his roommate when he gets married, are you?

90
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:46,668
Someone's going to move out. So who's it going to be?

91
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,372
Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment.

92
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,227
You've talked about who gets the apartment, right?

93
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,949
Yeah, we've talked about it.

94
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:59,283
So when Lily and I get married, who's going to get the apartment?

95
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,555
Oh, that's a tough one.

96
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:04,604
You know who I think could handle a problem like that?

97
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:05,997
Who?

98
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:09,254
Future Ted and Future Marshall.

99
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,729
Totally.

100
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,623
Let's let those guys handle it.

101
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:15,409
Damn it, Past Ted.

102
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,296
You blew it, dude.

103
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:20,450
Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic.

104
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,525
They're edging you out.

105
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:23,558
That's crazy. They're not edging me out.

106
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,211
Marshall's my best friend.

107
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:28,116
One of my best friends.

108
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,153
He wouldn't do that to me.

109
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:33,051
Just keep your eyes open, that's all I'm saying, Teddy.

110
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,985
Little things are going to be changing around that apartment.

111
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:37,868
Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid.

112
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,961
Okay, seriously, what is this girl's deal?

113
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,242
I'm sort of on a date with her.

114
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:43,969
What?

115
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:45,089
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,168
I found her online.

117
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:51,041
I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups.

118
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,299
I'm looking for a soul mate.

119
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:55,881
Someone who I can love and cuddle.

120
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,899
Or so it says in my profile.

121
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,039
But this girl...

122
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:07,471
she wants the same stuff. And it's... it's bumming me out.

123
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:09,292
All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.

124
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:09,929
All right.

125
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:10,993
You're going to the hospital?

126
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,968
No. See, he's going to go back over there, and I'm going to call him.

127
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:16,112
He's going to pretend it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.

128
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:18,395
Oh, Lord, fake emergency?

129
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,925
That is the lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book.

130
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,321
I expect more from you, Barney.

131
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,955
Well, stay tuned. I'm working on some stuff.

132
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:28,212
But in the meantime, wish me luck.

133
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,736
So, are you going to talk to Marshall?

134
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,325
He's going to want the apartment, I'm going to want the apartment.

135
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,778
It's going to lead to an argument. So, no.

136
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,827
Hmm, that's real healthy.

137
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:44,345
So when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it?

138
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,385
I should really make this call.

139
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,861
Ooh, can I do it?

140
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,666
Excuse me.

141
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:57,240
Hello.

142
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,379
Hi, there... sexy.

143
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:02,261
Hello, Aunt Cathy. What's up?

144
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,717
Oh, nothing.

145
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:07,627
Just sitting here thinking about you, hot stuff.

146
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,596
An accident?

147
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:12,737
Well, is Uncle Rudy going to be okay?

148
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:17,884
Aunt Cathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.

149
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:20,551
Oh, God!

150
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,890
Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?

151
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,847
Oh, come on, Daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.

152
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,766
Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine.

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,347
I'll be right there.

154
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,744
You know... I...

155
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:41,700
See you guys later.

156
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,993
Put it on my check.

157
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,919
Ah, this will be nice.

158
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:51,422
The three of us living together.

159
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:53,733
I think it's a good setup.

160
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,888
Man, this coffee's great.

161
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,395
It's really great.

162
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,045
Too great.

163
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,416
What happened to Shocky?

164
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,109
What's this?

165
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,140
My coffeemaker from my apartment.

166
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,867
It makes great coffee, right?

167
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:20,674
Yeah, definitely.

168
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:22,666
I mean, so does Shocky.

169
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:23,789
Really?

170
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:27,058
I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kind of rusty.

171
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,657
Yeah, no, it did.

172
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:32,066
I mean, I kind of liked the rusty taste.

173
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,328
I'm used to it, I don't know.

174
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:39,196
Also, Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock people.

175
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:44,633
No, it's just... you got to admit that shock, that... wakes you up in the morning.

176
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,205
You know what else wakes you up in the morning?

177
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:48,373
Coffee.

178
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,147
That's great. You're right.

179
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:54,267
Roomies.

180
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,136
I love it.

181
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,491
They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out.

182
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:01,918
I didn't believe it, but you're right.

183
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,081
Told you. That Lily-- she's a shrewd one.

184
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:08,983
Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker-- how dare she.

185
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:11,143
It's not just the coffeemaker.

186
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:12,245
Done.

187
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,725
The painting's done.

188
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,155
- That is great.
- Nice.

189
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,175
Where do you want to hang it?

190
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,422
I don't know.

191
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:23,359
Uh... Over the piano?

192
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,746
Yeah, that would be a good place for it.

193
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:31,169
Too bad the swords are there. 
We kind of love those swords.

194
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,811
Well, those swords have been up there a long time.

195
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,395
I know, right? I'd really miss them, too.

196
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:40,211
So, maybe Marshall's room.

197
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:42,373
Okay.

198
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,604
He was going to take the swords down.

199
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,737
Can you believe that?

200
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:49,732
Ted, why don't you just talk to him. He's your best friend.

201
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,084
One of your best friends.

202
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,016
The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.

203
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:01,418
Healthy communication? 
That's the worst idea ever.

204
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:04,115
Look, you held off their first advance. That's good.

205
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:06,402
Now it's time to counterstrike.

206
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,922
Well, what am I supposed to do?

207
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,843
You got to mark your territory. 
And I don't mean missing the toilet.

208
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,476
You've got to do something big.

209
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,385
What, like buy a new sofa?

210
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:17,847
Bigger.

211
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:19,768
Katie's here.

212
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,058
Okay, real quick... last night, epiphany--

213
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,644
I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready?

214
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:26,257
A lemon law.

215
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,315
A lemon law like for cars?

216
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,662
Exactly.

217
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:32,136
From the moment the date begins, you have five minutes

218
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,658
to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening.

219
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,774
And if you don't, it's no hard feelings. Just,

220
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:39,321
"Good night. Thanks for playing. See you never."

221
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:42,761
Huh? Huh? The lemon law-- it's going to be a thing.

222
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,464
Possibly, starting right now.

223
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,483
Hi, Katie. Barney.

224
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,886
Hi. It's good to finally meet you.

225
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:01,206
Hmm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.

226
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,493
Tell your friends.

227
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:11,379
It's going to be a thing.

228
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,104
Man, Ted's been acting weird.

229
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,340
He started labeling all his food.

230
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:20,151
He even carved "Ted" into that block of cheese.

231
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,362
Yeah.

232
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:23,097
Well, now it's Ed's.

233
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,579
I think he's not cool with me moving in.

234
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:29,377
No, that's not it.

235
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,446
You've basically lived here all along.

236
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:32,740
Ted loves you.

237
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,973
So what's he PMSing about?

238
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,679
I don't know.

239
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:39,951
But when he's ready to talk to me about it, he'll come and talk to me about it.

240
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,375
Are you kidding?

241
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,590
You guys never talk about anything.

242
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,781
He'll just let it fester under the surface

243
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,596
until he doesn't something big and passive-aggressive.

244
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,259
You clearly don't know Ted.

245
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,275
Delivery for Ted Mosby.

246
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,257
Your English phone booth arrived.

247
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:04,700
Oh, awesome! It's great, right?

248
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,556
Yeah, I guess.

249
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,018
I'm just not sure if Lily's going to like it.

250
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:16,424
Well, I like it, so I'm just going to keep it right here, if that's cool.

251
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,485
Of course.

252
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,411
I mean, we all live here, so...

253
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,791
we should all be able to have things the way we want them.

254
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:23,945
Exactly.

255
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:24,968
Great.

256
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,228
Terrific.

257
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,158
You like the phone booth, it stays.

258
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,269
I like this painting...

259
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:34,014
so I'm just going to hang it...

260
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,297
right here on the wall.

261
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,128
Oh. So it's like that, is it?

262
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:51,840
Oh, hello, governor. Oh, it's like that, isn't it? Cheerio.

263
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:53,661
Yeah, it's like that.

264
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:57,919
- I want this apartment.
- Well, I want it, too.

265
00:11:58,702 --> 00:11:59,944
You're a jerk.

266
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,797
No, I'm a visionary.

267
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,768
Lemon law! It's going to be a thing.

268
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:10,098
For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything

269
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,810
that's wrong with our no-attention-span society.

270
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,127
No. Wrong. Lemon law's awesome.

271
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:19,052
It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone.

272
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:22,749
You keep giving up on people so quickly. You could miss out on something great.

273
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,347
Okay, you're on a blind date.

274
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:28,472
Sitting across from the table is... that guy.

275
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,487
You really think it'll take more than five minutes

276
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,874
to realize there will be no date number two?

277
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:35,563
Yes, I do.

278
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,183
For all I know, that guy's my soul mate.

279
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:42,609
Oh... bad move, Scherbotsky.

280
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,504
Hi.

281
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,680
Have you met Robin?

282
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:49,941
- Hi.
- Hi.

283
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:55,903
All right, Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment.

284
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:58,033
May lead to an argument,

285
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,048
but we're settling this.

286
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,273
Or we could flip a coin.

287
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:02,703
Yeah, let's flip a coin.

288
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,178
- Flip it.
- Okay.

289
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:07,445
I'm flipping it. Here I go.

290
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,058
- Flip it.
- Okay, here I go.

291
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,266
- Flip it.
- I'm flipping.

292
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:14,852
But before I do, I just want to say something.

293
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:16,563
You didn't even want to move in here in the first place.

294
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,492
You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.

295
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:19,501
That was five years ago.

296
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,747
Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter.

297
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,706
Oh, snap. What else you got?

298
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,055
Okay, I'm flipping. Heads or tails?

299
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,328
- You don't need two rooms.
- Heads or tails, Marshall.

300
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,397
- Like you need two rooms.
- We might be starting a family soon.

301
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:36,273
Oh, no, you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're still in law school.

302
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:37,476
It's going to be at least three years.

303
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,922
It could be sooner. We're not that careful with our birth control.

304
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:41,097
Two-zip.

305
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,542
Oh, come on! You know damn well, I move out, that room's going unused.

306
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:47,604
Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate. Who's it going to be, Barney?

307
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,189
You know he cooks naked.

308
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:52,975
Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.

309
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,442
We were bros!

310
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:56,586
These swords represent our bro-hood.

311
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:59,228
And you took them down to make room for your fiancee's stupid painting?

312
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:02,771
My fiancee? Suddenly she's "my fiancee"?

313
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,318
Lily's a part of who I am.

314
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:07,046
And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are, too.

315
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,949
She's a bro by extension.

316
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,542
I deserve this apartment, Marshall.

317
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:13,501
No more than I do.

318
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:15,609
Great.

319
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:17,073
So let's flip for it.

320
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:19,590
Flip it.

321
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,409
Si this is how we're deciding who gets the apartment?

322
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,670
I guess so.

323
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:30,141
How are we doing this exactly?

324
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:31,593
Is this, like, to the death?

325
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,081
We should probably figure that out.

326
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,568
Ooh! Ow. Ow.

327
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,320
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay.

328
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:38,797
Can I observe something?

329
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,246
That this is kind of awesome?

330
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,133
Totally.

331
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,437
- I can't believe we didn't do this before.
- I know.

332
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:48,317
Thank you.

333
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:51,532
I can't believe this.

334
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:55,933
I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant.

335
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:57,407
Sweet.

336
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,867
It's a nice place.

337
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:02,055
It's good to know the future has ribs.

338
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:06,063
In the future, food will most likely be served in gel cap form.

339
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,239
Plus, cows will probably have died out by then.

340
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,083
Or be our leaders.

341
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,303
Hello.

342
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,859
H-H-H-H-Hey. Time's running out, Scherbotsky.

343
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:21,278
Last chance for the lemon law.

344
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:22,394
Leave me alone.

345
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:25,323
4:56, 4:57, 4:58...

346
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,269
We're only just getting to know each other.

347
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:29,339
Say I'm right and this could all be over.

348
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,599
This could be your call from the hospital.

349
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:32,998
Sorry.

350
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:37,898
Let me guess-- there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.

351
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:39,988
No, I would never do that.

352
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,563
I don't want to go anywhere.

353
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:42,883
I'm all yours.

354
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:47,647
Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money...

355
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:52,768
- Oh, that was awesome.
- I know.

356
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:53,967
Do it again.

357
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:56,855
Okay. But this time jump up and I'll swipe your legs.

358
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,944
Look... here's why I should get the place.

359
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,354
You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right?

360
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:14,855
I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates.

361
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,592
And on top of that, I have to be homeless. Does that seem fair?

362
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,504
Oh, boo-freakin'-hoo.

363
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:20,555
What?!

364
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:25,153
Woe is me. "I'm not married yet. my ovaries are shrinking." Ted!

365
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,809
If you wanted to be married by now, you would be, but you're not.

366
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:28,886
And you know why?

367
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,617
Because you're irrationally picky.

368
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,746
You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.

369
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,335
- "Anhedonic"?
- Anhedonic.

370
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,047
It means you can't enjoy anything.

371
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,167
The hell I can't.

372
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,730
- I'm enjoying this.
- I know. This rules!

373
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,746
Hey. I'm sorry I took those swords down.

374
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,831
Dude, that's okay. It lead to this totally rad swordfight, didn't it?

375
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,812
Yeah, it did.

376
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,841
You remeer when we first got these swords?

377
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:59,494
It was the day we moved in.

378
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:03,235
Congratulations, Marshall, we live in an apartment with swords on the wall.

379
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:06,360
List of lifelong dreams, you're now half as long.

380
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,271
Crap, I'm missing one of the screws for this table.

381
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,565
Just use this wood glue. It'll hold.

382
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,250
Yeah.

383
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:22,354
Oh god, I'll be right there. 
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

384
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,876
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.

385
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,180
Hab Slosi' Quch!

386
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:31,678
It's a Klingon insult. You have no honor.

387
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:34,753
You know, if you felt this way, you could've just been upfront.

388
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:37,520
No, I swear, that was a real call. I just...

389
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:39,143
Oh, forget it.

390
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,452
I stabbed Lily.

391
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,821
I stabbed my fiancee.

392
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:52,615
Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancee?

393
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,191
I'm kidding.

394
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,167
Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment.

395
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:02,176
But you fought so bravely for it.

396
00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:05,798
I wasn't fighting for the apartment, I was fighting for...

397
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,886
I don't know... for everything to stay the way it is.

398
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,478
But I'm not going to get that, so...

399
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:15,250
seriously, take the place, it's yours.

400
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:16,785
Is she okay?

401
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:18,518
They're just patching her up. She's going to be fine.

402
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,976
So get this: I was on a date with this girl, Jackie...

403
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,524
What? You said she's fine.

404
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,719
So anyway, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie...

405
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:30,172
Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression.

406
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:36,110
I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie... oh.

407
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:41,676
Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to lemon law you.

408
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:44,749
It's out there. It's a thing.

409
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,667
The lemon law is a thing!

410
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,771
Damn, I should've called it Barney's law.

411
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:51,543
- But you totally...
- Just let him have this one.

412
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,624
All set.

413
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,133
She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed roundtable?

414
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:01,914
That's us.

415
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,356
A swordfight?

416
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,285
- Sorry, Lily.
- Sorry, Lily.

417
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:11,718
On Monday, I'm going to have to tell my kindergarten class,

418
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,202
who I teach not to run with scissors,

419
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:18,562
that my fiance ran me through with a frickin' broadsword.

420
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:22,892
Well just to be fair, 
it didn't go all the way through.

421
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:28,472
I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?

422
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:30,347
You're right.

423
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:31,993
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:36,047
We were fighting to see who gets the apartment, and I won.

425
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,653
Uh, you didn't win.

426
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:39,886
I... gave it to you.

427
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:43,395
Wait, wait, wait. 
I don't want that apartment.

428
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,916
It's a boy apartment. It's...

429
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:49,175
full of swords and video games and...

430
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,600
kind of smells like dude.

431
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:57,336
I mean, it's fine for now, 
but when we get married,

432
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,183
I want to start a new life with you...

433
00:20:00,288 --> 00:20:02,150
in a new place.

434
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,853
Gonna miss the old place.

435
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,631
I will, too.

436
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,471
But we're not going to get married for, like, a year.

437
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,657
Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem.

438
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,247
Let that guy deal with it.

439
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:15,635
Totally.

440
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:20,079
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking, but I'm starving.

441
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,163
Let's go get some dinner.

442
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,305
I know just the place.

443
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,842
Chinese restaurant. I still don't believe it.

444
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,291
I told you.

445
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,214
Hey, a toast.

446
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:34,685
Life is full of changes.

447
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:38,091
One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings.

448
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,347
But the important stuff doesn't change.

449
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,667
To the important stuff.

450
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,179
Here, here.

451
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:44,496
- Cheers. 
- Cheers.

452
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,108
And to the lemon law.

453
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:50,013
Self click.

454
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:53,333
And by the way, I bought these glasses.

455
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:55,175
Bought them at Ikea.

456
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,849
These are my glasses!

457
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:00,166
I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.

458
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,750
And I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape you made me in sophomore year.

459
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:05,210
Yeah, right.

460
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,445
Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.

461
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,076
I love you, Lily.

462
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,409
Happy Valentine's Day 1997.
