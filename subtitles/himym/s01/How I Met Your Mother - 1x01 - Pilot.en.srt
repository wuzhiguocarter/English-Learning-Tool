1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,002
Kids, I'm gonna tell you an incredible story ;

2
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,263
the story of how I met your mother.

3
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:10,551
Are we being punished for something ?

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:11,173
No.

5
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:13,059
Yeah, is this gonna take a while ?

6
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,950
Yes. 25 years ago, before I was Dad,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,083
I had this whole other life.

8
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,796
It was way back in 2005.

9
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:27,584
I was 27, just starting to make it as an architect

10
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:30,482
and living in New York  with Marshall,  my best friend from college.

11
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:31,708
My life was good.

12
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,508
And then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up.

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,112
Will you marry me ?

14
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:38,937
Yes. Perfect !

15
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,008
And then you're engaged.
You pop the champagne.

16
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:41,756
You drink a toast.

17
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,593
You have sex on the kitchen floor.

18
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:45,406
Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.

19
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,110
Got it.

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,585
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

21
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,906
Dude, are you kidding ?
It's you and Lilly.

22
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,378
I've been there for all the big moments of you and Lilly :

23
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,838
night you met, your first date, other first things.

24
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:59,642
Yeah, sorry.
We thought you were asleep.

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,699
It's physics, Marshall.

26
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,445
If the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves, too.

27
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:06,027
My God.

28
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,762
You're getting engaged tonight.

29
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:12,260
Yeah. What are you doin' tonight ?

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,168
What was I doing ?

31
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,741
Here Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life.

32
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,611
And me ?

33
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,572
I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.

34
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,858
Hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls ?

35
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:27,965
Well, now I've got a new favorite... Lebanese girls.

36
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:30,148
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

37
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,111
Hey, you want to do somethin' tonight ?

38
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:35,218
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes. And suit up !

39
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:40,213
Where's your suit ?

40
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:42,841
Just once, when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.

41
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,594
I did that one time.

42
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,747
It was a blazer !

43
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:51,014
You know, ever since college it's been, Marshall and Lilly and me.

44
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,855
Now, it's gonna be Marshall and Lilly... and me.

45
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,508
They'll get married, start a family.

46
00:01:55,508 --> 00:02:00,124
Before long, I'm that weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.

47
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:03,545
I see what this is about.

48
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,871
Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met ?

49
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,498
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

50
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:13,098
Barney. We met at the urinal.

51
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:14,460
Oh, right. Right.

52
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,460
Lesson one : lose the goatee.

53
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,618
It doesn't go with your suit.

54
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:20,311
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two : get a suit.

55
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,127
Suits are cool.
Exhibit "A."

56
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:27,140
Lesson three : don't even think about getting married till you're 30.

57
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,410
30. Right. You're right.

58
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,224
I guess it's just, your best friend gets engaged,

59
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:32,478
you start thinking about that stuff.

60
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:34,151
I thought I was your best friend.

61
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,469
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

62
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,486
You're my best friend, Barney.

63
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,354
Good. Then, as your best friend,

64
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,163
I suggest we play a little game I like to call

65
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,235
- "Have you met Ted ?"
- Wait. No, no, no.

66
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,337
We're not playing "Have you met Ted ?"

67
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,739
Hi, have you met Ted ?

68
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,817
Hi, I'm Ted.

69
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,701
Yasmine.

70
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,972
That's a very pretty name.

71
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,779
Thanks. It's Lebanese.

72
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:00,397
I'm exhausted.

73
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:02,024
It was finger-painting day at school,

74
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:05,731
and a five year-old boy got to second base with me.

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,690
Wow ! You're cooking ?

76
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,346
Yes, I am.

77
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:11,447
Aw...

78
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,996
Are you sure that's a good idea ?

79
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:17,078
After last time, you looked really creepy without eyebrows.

80
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:18,431
I can handle this.

81
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,697
I think you'll find I'm full of surprises tonight.

82
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,018
So, there's more surprises ?
Like what ?

83
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,064
Marshall was in his second year of law school,

84
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,435
so he was pretty good  at thinking on his feet.

85
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,731
Boogedyboo !

86
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,481
And that's all of 'em.

87
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:34,033
I'm gonna go... cook.

88
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,437
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

89
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:38,611
I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.

90
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,190
So, do you think you'll ever get married ?

91
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,041
Well, maybe eventually...

92
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,150
some fall day, possibly in Central Park.

93
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,757
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

94
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,842
Band, no DJ.
People will dance !

95
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:51,517
I'm not gonna worry about it !

96
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,857
Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged ?

97
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:58,773
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh ?

98
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,279
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

99
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,129
One more for the lady !

100
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:06,783
Oh, hey, look what I got.

101
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:13,597
Oh, honey ! Champagne.

102
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,638
Yeah.

103
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:20,910
No. You are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne.

104
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,550
- I'm not scared.
- Then open it.

105
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,591
Fine.

106
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,342
Please open it ?

107
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,554
You are unbelievable, Marshall.

108
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:31,062
There are two big questions a man has to ask in life.

109
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,764
One, you plan out for months.

110
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,604
The other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar.

111
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:36,934
Will you marry me ?

112
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,284
You wanna go out sometime ?

113
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,856
Of course, you idiot !

114
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:44,495
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

115
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,024
'Sup, Carl ?

116
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,142
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

117
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,759
Did you know there's a Pop Tart under your fridge ?

118
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,347
No, but dibs.

119
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,882
Where's that champagne ?

120
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,876
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.

121
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:10,574
I don't know why I was so scared of this.

122
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,496
It's pretty easy, right ?

123
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,640
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden ?

124
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,910
This is crazy.
I'm not ready to settle down.

125
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,340
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl ?

126
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,431
The plan has always been don't even think about it until you're 30.

127
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,567
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.

128
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:29,002
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.

129
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,068
Even if I was ready, which I'm not...

130
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:35,544
but if I was, it's, like, "Okay, I'm ready. Where is she ?"

131
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,486
And there she was.

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,041
It was like something from an old movie,

133
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,278
where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor,

134
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:56,091
turns to his buddy and says, "See that girl ?

135
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,139
I'm gonna marry her someday."

136
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,941
Hey, Barney, see that girl ?

137
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:03,721
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.

138
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,295
Go say hi.

139
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,159
I can't just go say hi.

140
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,374
I need a plan.

141
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:10,415
I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom,

142
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,359
then I'll strategically place myself by the jukebox...

143
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,764
Hi, have you met Ted ?

144
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:20,393
Let me guess... Ted.

145
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,253
Sorry, Lilly.
I'm so sorry.

146
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,445
- Take us to the hospital.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

147
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:28,708
Did you hit her ?

148
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:31,902
Hit me ? Please !

149
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:34,810
This guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun.

150
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,370
He's all like, "Oh, honey. Did that hurt ?"

151
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,040
And, I'm like, "Come on !
Let me have it, you pansy !"

152
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,516
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, no ! It's okay.

153
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,386
Go on.

154
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:46,449
So, these, uh, spankings...

155
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,309
you in pajamas or au naturel ?

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,643
So, what do you do ?

157
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm a reporter for Metro News One.

158
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,893
Well, kind of a reporter.

159
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,251
I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news.

160
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,678
You know, like, um...

161
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,185
monkey who can play the ukulele.

162
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,277
I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.

163
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:06,958
Bigger, like, uh... gorilla with an upright bass ?

164
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,292
Sorry. You're really pretty.

165
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,743
Oh, your friends don't seem to happy.

166
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,901
Yeah, see, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend.

167
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,397
So, tonight, every guy is "the enemy."

168
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:20,869
You know if it'll make your friend feel better,

169
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,992
you could throw a drink in my face. I don't mind.

170
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,914
She would love that !

171
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,247
And it does look fun in the movies.

172
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,427
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night ?

173
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:30,632
Oh, I can't.

174
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:32,651
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

175
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:35,003
Some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake.

176
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,497
Guess who's covering it ?

177
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,587
That's gonna take a week ?

178
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,533
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.

179
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,996
Hey ! What's takin' so long ?

180
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,550
Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how 'bout tomorrow night ?

181
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:49,317
Yeah. What the hell ?

182
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:55,557
Jerk !

183
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,764
That was fun.

184
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:01,738
De... wait for it... nied !

185
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,143
Denied !

186
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,836
We're goin' out tomorrow night.

187
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:07,238
I thought we were playin' laser tag tomorrow night.

188
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,716
Yeah, I was never gonna go play laser tag.

189
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,079
The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.

190
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,673
That is one badass blue French horn.

191
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:20,298
Yeah.

192
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,987
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

193
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,609
Son, a piece of advice :

194
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:29,064
when you go on a first date, you really don't wanna say "Smurf penis."

195
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,499
Girls don't ordinarily like that.

196
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,887
But this was no ordinary girl.

197
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,311
Lilly ?

198
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,968
How long have you been sitting there ?

199
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,875
Stupid eye patch.

200
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:52,395
Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

201
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,677
Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman ?

202
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:57,432
Now, let's see... she likes dogs ?

203
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:58,905
I've got five dogs.

204
00:08:58,905 --> 00:08:59,798
She drinks scotch ?

205
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:02,680
I love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch.

206
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,679
Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters ?

207
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,402
Ray ! When someone asks you if you're a god, you say "Yes !"

208
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,664
And I'm saving the best for last.

209
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:14,112
Do you want these ?
I hate olives.

210
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,052
She hates olives ! Awesome !

211
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,822
The olive theory.

212
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:20,598
The olive theory is based on my friends Marshall and Lilly.

213
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,281
He hates olives, she loves them.

214
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,138
In a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple.

215
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:25,612
Perfect balance.

216
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:30,487
You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.

217
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:33,591
I could take 'em off your hands.

218
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,339
They're all yours.

219
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,412
Oh, it is on !

220
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,076
It is on till the break of dawn.

221
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:43,476
But wait.

222
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,001
It's only the break of 10:30.
What happened ?

223
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:50,034
I gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace.

224
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,800
It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be French.

225
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,057
- No green clarinet ?
- Nope.

226
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:54,588
Come on. No purple tuba ?

227
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,635
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

228
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:58,833
There you are !

229
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,931
We got a jumper.

230
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,845
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

231
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,386
Come on. You're coverin' it !

232
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:06,149
Um... all right.
I'll be right there.

233
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,477
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,330
I had a really great time tonight.

235
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:13,404
Yeah.

236
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,394
So ?! Did you kiss her ?

237
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,563
No. The moment wasn't right.

238
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,807
Look, this woman could actually be my future wife.

239
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:21,320
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

240
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,030
Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.

241
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,461
So you chickened out like a little bitch.

242
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,163
What ? I did not chicken out.

243
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:30,798
You know what ?

244
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,423
I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate

245
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,456
who hasn't been single since the first week of college.

246
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,026
Anyone who's single would tell you the same thing,

247
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:40,530
even the dumbest single person alive.

248
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,939
And if you don't believe me, call him.

249
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:45,462
Hey, loser.

250
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,605
How's not playing laser tag ?

251
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,873
Because playing laser tag is awesome !

252
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,625
- Oh, I killed you, Conner !
- Don't make me get your mom !

253
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,698
Hey, listen.
I need your opinion on something.

254
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,251
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.

255
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:56,332
And suit up !

256
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,657
So, these guys think I chickened out.

257
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:00,758
What do you think ?

258
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:04,549
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.

259
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,898
She didn't even give me the signal.

260
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,752
What, is she gonna, she gonna bat her eyes ayou in Morse code ?

261
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:14,724
"Ted... kiss me."
No ! You just kiss her !

262
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,725
Not if you don't get the signal.

263
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,320
Did Marshall give me the signal ?

264
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,713
No ! I didn't. I swear.

265
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:26,651
But, see, at least tonight,

266
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,199
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

267
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:28,979
never gonna happen.

268
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,245
You should have kissed her.

269
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,275
Oh, I should have kissed her.

270
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,367
Well, maybe in a week when she gets back from Orlando.

271
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,627
A week ? That's like a year in hot girl time.

272
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:37,837
She'll forget all about you.

273
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:41,158
Mark my words... you will never see that one again.

274
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,756
There she is.

275
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:45,791
Ooh ! She's cute.
Hey, Carl, turn it up.

276
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,750
...persuaded him to reconsider.

277
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,807
At which point, the man came down off the ledge,

278
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,690
giving this bizarre story a happy ending.

279
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,116
- Reporting from Metro One News...
- Guy didn't jump.

280
00:11:56,755 --> 00:11:58,066
I'm gonna go kiss her.

281
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,202
Right now.

282
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:00,582
Look, dude.
It's midnight.

283
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:04,323
As your future lawyer, I'm gonna advise you that's freakin' crazy.

284
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,801
I never do anything crazy.

285
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,334
I'm always waiting for the moment, planning the moment.

286
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:09,704
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.

287
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:11,197
This may be the only moment I'm gonna get.

288
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,038
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.

289
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:14,727
I gotta take the leap !

290
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:16,905
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,

291
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,404
'cause for me it's fall in love and get married,

292
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,444
and for him it's... death.

293
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,046
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

294
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,710
By the way, did I congratulate you two ?

295
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,773
I'm doing this.

296
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:29,977
Let's go.

297
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:31,730
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

298
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:33,533
Barney ?

299
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,141
All right, but under one condition.

300
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,147
Look at you, you beautiful bastard. You suited up !

301
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,913
This is totally going in my blog !

302
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:44,859
Stop the car.

303
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,296
Uh, pull over right here.

304
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:49,090
I gotta do something.

305
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,895
Excuse me. Pardon me. Just a sec'.

306
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,512
Enjoy your coffee.

307
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,043
Go ! Go ! Go !

308
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,615
Everybody brings flowers.

309
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,056
Okay.

310
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,254
Moment of truth.

311
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,196
Wish me luck.

312
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,998
Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.

313
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:19,443
"This just in." Okay.

314
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,303
Kiss her, Ted !
Kiss her good !

315
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,667
Kiss the crap outta that girl !

316
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,787
Marshall, remember this night.

317
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:29,951
When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech,

318
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,057
you're gonna tell this story.

319
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,387
Why does he get to be the best man ?

320
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,434
I'm your best friend !

321
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,825
As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind.

322
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:44,294
Unfortunately, one particular  thought did not.

323
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,065
I've got five dogs.

324
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,489
Not good. Not good.

325
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,157
- No !
- Get back in there !

326
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:52,773
You're wearing a suit !

327
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,305
Ted ?

328
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,158
Hi.

329
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,053
I was just, uh...

330
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,327
Come on up.

331
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:11,428
He's in.

332
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,712
So...

333
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,872
Ranjit, you must have done it with a Lebanese girl ?

334
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:19,102
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

335
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:21,628
I'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom.

336
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:25,204
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

337
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:26,708
The women hot there ?

338
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,033
Here's a picture of my wife.

339
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:32,950
A simple "no" would have sufficed.

340
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,529
She's lovely.

341
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,427
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning in a suit ?

342
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,505
I was just hoping to...

343
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:46,641
get those olives...

344
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,480
that you said I could have.

345
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:51,525
Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth ?

346
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,033
Are you trying to get me drunk ?

347
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,275
For starters.

348
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:10,002
So, Marshall, this olive theory, based on you and Lilly ?

349
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:11,558
You hate olives.

350
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,492
Lilly loves 'em.
You can't stand 'em.

351
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:14,839
Yeah. Hate olives.

352
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,460
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th street, dish of olives, you had some... what up ?

353
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:25,734
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.

354
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,734
- I swear.
- I swear.

355
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,120
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.

356
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,012
Lilly asked if she could have my olives.

357
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:38,311
- I said, "Sure. I hate olives."
- But, you like olives.

358
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:40,783
Well, I was 18, okay ?
I was a virgin.

359
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,985
Been waitin' my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.

360
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,542
Marshall, I'm gonna give you an early wedding present.

361
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,686
Don't get married.

362
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,897
I think I like your olive theory.

363
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:02,553
I think I like your new French horn.

364
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,370
I think I like your nose.

365
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:08,518
I think I'm in love with you.

366
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:11,217
What ?! What ?! What ?!

367
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,643
Come on, man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right ?

368
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:14,953
You know what that is.

369
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:15,685
Hunger.

370
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,524
You're hungry for experience.

371
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,025
Hungry for something new.

372
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,094
Hungry for olives.

373
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,184
But you're too scared to do anything about it.

374
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,029
Yeah, I'm scared, okay ?

375
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,924
But, when I think of spending the rest of my life with Lilly...

376
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,390
committing, forever, no other women...

377
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,808
doesn't scare me at all.

378
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,496
I'm marrying that girl.

379
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:41,075
Lilly.

380
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,689
Lilly, I like olives.

381
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,177
We'll make it work.

382
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,160
So, Orlando.
You gonna hit Disneyworld ?

383
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,428
You love me ?!

384
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,784
I-I-I can't believe I said that.

385
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:08,236
Why did I say that ?
Who says that ?

386
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,116
I should just go.

387
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,259
Hold on.

388
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:12,663
Wait a minute.

389
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:16,385
Promised you these.

390
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,366
Olives.
Thanks. I love you.

391
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,344
What is wrong with me ?

392
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:24,225
Why are we still sitting here ?

393
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:25,849
Let's go. We can still make last call.

394
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,706
What do you say, Lil ?

395
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,239
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum ?

396
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,844
'Cause you're a pirate.

397
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,136
Okay, eye patch, gone.

398
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,836
And we can't just abandon Ted.

399
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,563
If it doesn't go well up there, he's gonna need some support.

400
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:42,367
It's been, like, 20 minutes.

401
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,662
You think they're doin' it ?

402
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,037
You think they're doin' it in front of the dogs ?

403
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,337
Doggy style.

404
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,690
Hey, there was a girl in college, she had this golden retriever...

405
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,118
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

406
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,296
Hit it, Ranjit.

407
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,453
So, when you tell this story to your friends,

408
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,520
could you avoid the word "psycho ?"

409
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:04,456
I'd prefer. "eccentric."

410
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,951
Good night... psycho.

411
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:11,899
Great.

412
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:13,600
Um, how do I get to the F train ?

413
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:17,928
Oh, um, two blocks that way and take a right.

414
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,373
You know what ?

415
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:25,378
I'm done being single.

416
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,203
I'm not good at it.

417
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:30,865
Look, obviously, you can't tell a woman you just met you love her.

418
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:33,651
But... it sucks that you can't.

419
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:35,857
I'll tell you something, though.

420
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:39,604
If a woman... not you, just some hypothetical woman...

421
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,382
were to bear with me through all this,

422
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:43,908
I think I'd make a damn good husband.

423
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,707
Because, that's the stuff I'd be good at,

424
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,153
stuff like making her laugh and being a good father.

425
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,569
And walking her five hypothetical dogs.

426
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,547
Being a good kisser.

427
00:18:56,889 --> 00:18:58,542
Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.

428
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,106
Oh, I've got references.

429
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:02,380
Good night, Ted.

430
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,834
And I'm a good handshaker.

431
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,285
That's a pretty great handshake.

432
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:17,813
And that was it.

433
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,613
I'll probably never see her again.

434
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:23,260
What ?

435
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,444
That was the signal.

436
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:28,175
That long, lingering handshake ?
You should have kissed her.

437
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:30,368
There's no such thing as "the signal."

438
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,580
But, yeah, that was the signal.

439
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:34,532
Signal.

440
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,983
Ah, Carl, thank you.

441
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:38,863
Something I gotta do.

442
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:42,246
By the way, you should have kissed her.

443
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,633
Carl ! You guys weren't there.

444
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:49,006
I am so turned on right now.

445
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:50,594
Guys, trust me.

446
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:51,999
I've seen the signal.

447
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,603
That was not the signal.

448
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:55,531
Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

449
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:59,905
- To my fiancée.
- To the future.

450
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,732
To one hell of a night !

451
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,397
That was not the signal.

452
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:09,709
I asked her about it years later.

453
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,783
And, yeah, that was the signal.

454
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,272
I could have kissed her.

455
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,146
But that's the funny thing about destiny.

456
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:17,175
It happens whether you plan it or not.

457
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,061
I mean, I never thought I'd see that girl again,

458
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,782
but it turns out I was just too close to the puzzle

459
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,525
to see the picture that was forming.

460
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:27,880
Because, that, kids, is the true story of how I met your Aunt Robin.

461
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,481
Aunt Robin ?

462
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,472
I thought this was how you met mom !

463
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:34,509
Will you relax ?
I'm getting to it.

464
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:38,540
Like I said, it's a long story.

465
