1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:02,099
<i>Well, kids, here we are.</i>

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:04,897
<i>We've arrived.
My 30th birthday.</i>

3
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:06,788
<i>The long-awaited story of...</i>

4
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:09,399
<i>...the goat.</i>

5
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,158
<i>That week started
just like any other.</i>

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,966
<i>Barney woke up
in some girl's bed.</i>

7
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:20,169
In my experience,
the way this normally goes is,

8
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,111
we lie here for a while,

9
00:00:22,442 --> 00:00:24,688
make a little awkward chitchat.

10
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:26,790
Check.

11
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:29,692
Then I make up
some Cabinet meeting,

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,229
heart surgery, rocket test flight
I've got to be at,

13
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:35,187
slip out of the apartment
and never call you again.

14
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,800
And later at the bar,
you tell your good friend Robin

15
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:41,490
the story of your latest conquest,
and she thinks to herself,

16
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,500
"Who is this sad,
self-loathing idiot

17
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:47,020
who climbed into bed
with Barney Stinson?"

18
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:50,590
Actually, you usually
say that out loud.

19
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:54,852
So...

20
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,623
I just slept with
my best friend's ex-girlfriend.

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,170
And I just slept with
my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.

22
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:05,211
Best friend.

23
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:09,943
Okay, here's the deal, Barney.

24
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,370
The second my feet
touch the ground,

25
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,962
- this never happened.
- Okay.

26
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,070
Wait.

27
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:21,312
Right click, save as...
Into the .bpeg folder, and okay.

28
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,170
This never happened.

29
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:26,310
It's a good plan.

30
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,980
Now we go back to exactly
the way things were before.

31
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,980
Alright.

33
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:34,573
So, Robin?

34
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:36,622
Yes, Barney?

35
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,771
Guess who nailed the chick from
Metro News One last night?

36
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:49,161
How I Met Your Mother 3x17
<i>- The Goat -</i>

37
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:01,271
Okay, uh,
let me take a shower,

38
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:02,940
till June,

39
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:06,062
and, since you were never here to begin
with, you won't be here when I get out.

40
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,462
- Okay.
- Okay.

41
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,292
This never happened.

42
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,731
Never happened.

43
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,843
Never... happened.

44
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:19,191
<i>But pretending it never happened
wouldn't be that easy.</i>

45
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:21,620
So, tell us,
what was it like?

46
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:24,200
- What?
- Penetrating that barrier.

47
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,141
You and I are the first ones
to hit it.

48
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:30,143
Well, not the first ones, certainly,
but the first ones at this table.

49
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,592
I... I... I...
I'm... I'm...

50
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:36,313
Although, I'm gonna be
hitting it pretty soon.

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,341
Yeah, you are.

52
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,970
Yeah, and when I hit it,
I'm going to go nuts.

53
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,492
It's gonna be all night,
and I think I want a clown there.

54
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:46,221
I'm a little bit scared of clowns,
but for you, I'm there.

55
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,653
What are you taking about?!

56
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,290
The big three-oh.

57
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:52,412
You know,
my 30th birthday's this Friday.

58
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:53,541
Did you forget?

59
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,030
What kind of friend is this guy?

60
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:56,833
Ha-ha, right.

61
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,161
A great friend, by the way.
The best.

62
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:02,863
Is it my imagination,
or are these drinks getting smaller?

63
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,871
If this were a doctor's office,
they'd say, "Try again."

64
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,083
How you doing there, Robin?

65
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,423
I'm good.

66
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:13,333
Oh, so, I made a decision. I'm going
to go through all my old stuff,

67
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:15,973
and I'm getting rid of anything
I have no use for anymore.

68
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,522
Barney, you want my Xbox?

69
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:19,682
Ted, she has a name!

70
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,430
And just what
are you accusing me of?

71
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,271
Liking video games?

72
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,133
I'm gonna get a drink.

73
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:27,643
I'll come with you.

74
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,351
God, this is awkward.

75
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:32,113
- What is?
- Being around Ted.

76
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:33,283
Why?

77
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,440
Because of our thing.

78
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:35,680
What thing?

79
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,610
You're really gonna pretend
this never happened?

80
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,112
What never happened?

81
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:43,202
What are you guys
talking about?

82
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:44,233
Nothing.

83
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,961
Guys, cut the act.
I know.

84
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:52,033
I know about the surprise party
you guys are throwing me.

85
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:54,080
Marshall let it slip earlier today.

86
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:57,061
Hey, I'll totally act surprised
and everything. Just...

87
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:58,133
be sure to invite Stella.

88
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:01,773
Stella!
You have a serious girlfriend now!

89
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,622
You're over this one.
Robin who, right?

90
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:09,161
Stella makes this one look like a
filthy bag of garbage, am I right?

91
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,071
Happy birthday, bro.

92
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:18,950
- Hello.
- Hey, Marshall,

93
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:20,030
I need your help.

94
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:22,531
Yeah, I'm kind of real focused
on the job hunt right now.

95
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:24,243
I know. I want to hire you.

96
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:27,553
For the last time, Barney,
I will not be your butler.

97
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:30,753
I need a lawyer.
I'll pay you.

98
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,593
How much?

99
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,052
- A little.
- I'll take it.

100
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:41,850
So, I'm reading this, and,
I got to say,

101
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,780
this might be a little bit
over my head.

102
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:44,910
For one thing,

103
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:48,441
I'm fairly certain that if these
contracts aren't executed precisely,

104
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,671
we will be at war
with Portugal.

105
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:53,670
Forget that.
That's a Tuesday for me.

106
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:56,430
New shredder.

107
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:58,621
This baby'll chew up
a bicycle in 17 seconds.

108
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:02,281
From Sky Mall.
It's all from Sky Mall.

109
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:04,120
Whenever I get upset,
I shop at Sky Mall.

110
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:05,843
- Want a hot dog?
- Of course.

111
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:08,002
Why are you upset?

112
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:09,780
Marshall,

113
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,300
I'm about to tell you a secret

114
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:15,540
that you can't tell anyone...
not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.

115
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,330
No. No, no, no,
I don't want any more secrets,

116
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:21,642
especially now that I know what you guys
did to the drinking water in Lisbon.

117
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:24,240
You are hearing
this secret, Marshall.

118
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:26,100
- I... I slept...
- Lala-bo da-boh

119
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,050
- Stop... Stop doing that.
- La la la, la la!

120
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,601
- I slept...
- Laba-da bay-doh

121
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,771
Hicka-ba-ta-bo...

122
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,940
I slept with Robin.

123
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,321
You slept with Robin?

124
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,160
Are you mad at me?

125
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,241
I don't know.

126
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,752
- How's the hot dog?
- It's helping.

127
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:55,803
You slept with Robin?!

128
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,291
I cannot keep that secret.

129
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,273
I mean, you know
I at least have to tell Lily.

130
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,640
You can't. You can't tell anyone.
Attorney-client privilege.

131
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:03,891
Why are you doing this to me?!

132
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,631
Because I need you, Marshall,
as my lawyer,

133
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:08,352
to prove that
I didn't do anything wrong.

134
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:10,391
How can I help you
as your lawyer?

135
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,783
You didn't break
any laws, did you?

136
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,560
Robin knows you slept with her,
doesn't she?

137
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,030
I didn't break any state
or federal laws,

138
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:23,441
but I think I broke a much,
much higher law.

139
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,122
The Bro Code.

140
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:30,312
<i>For many years, we had heard
Barney quote the Bro Code,</i>

141
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,871
<i>a list of do's and
don'ts for all bros.</i>

142
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:34,650
<i>Some were basic.</i>

143
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:37,380
Bro Code article one:
"Bros before hoes."

144
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,412
<i>Some were
unbelievably complicated.</i>

145
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,489
Bro Code article 89:
"The mom of a bro is always off limits,

146
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:48,657
"but the stepmom of a bro
is fair game if she initiates it,

147
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,391
"and/or is wearing at least
one article of leopard print clothing."

148
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,662
<i>And some were just
plain disturbing.</i>

149
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:57,063
Bro Code article 34:

150
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,732
"Bros cannot make eye contact
during a devil's three-way."

151
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:03,112
Two dudes.

152
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:08,873
This is not a legal document.
This is just something you wrote.

153
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:10,322
You think I wrote that?

154
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,401
Oh, Marshall,

155
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:17,293
don't you know the glorious
history of the Bro Code?

156
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:19,852
<i>The year was 1776.

157
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:21,673
<i>The place: Philadelphia.

158
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:24,210
<i>Benjamin Franklin and George Washington
were having a drink.

159
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:28,783
But, bro, seriously,
I called dibs on that wench.

160
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:31,273
You codpiece blocked me.

161
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,143
So what if I did?
There's no rule against it.

162
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:35,512
Well, there should be.

163
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,790
There should be a set of rules
that govern the way bros

164
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:39,771
comport themselves
among other bros.

165
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,382
But who shall write such a document?

166
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:45,611
I have to go to Me, D.C.,
and pose for the dollar bill.

167
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:48,453
And I have to do some
kite-flying or something.

168
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,610
I shall write this set of rules.

169
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:53,583
And I shall inscribe it
on the back of the Constitution.

170
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,300
To save paper.

171
00:07:56,286 --> 00:07:57,401
It's resolved!

172
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,581
Barnabas Stinson shall write...

173
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,753
the Bro Code.

174
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:03,843
And I shall include a provision

175
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:07,013
that stateth no eye contact
in a devil's three-way.

176
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,130
- Seconded.
- Seconded.

177
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:13,261
Listen, what do you want me for?

178
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,321
I've just been losing
my mind lately,

179
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:16,742
and do you know
why I feel so bad?

180
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,443
Yeah, because
you slept with Robin.

181
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,961
No, that was awesome.

182
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,802
I feel bad

183
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:26,081
because the Bro Code clearly states
"No sex with your bro's ex."

184
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,971
But if you, my lawyer,

185
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,452
can find a loophole somewhere,
then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.

186
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:34,911
And you would pay me for that?

187
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,393
No, I'll just be the one
shredding your paperwork.

188
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:40,161
Technically, you'll be paid
by a toy factory in Pyongyang.

189
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:42,411
Barney, I'm no shrink, okay,

190
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:45,523
but don't you see that this is just
a desperate way for you to avoid

191
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,841
an unpleasant
confrontation with Ted?

192
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,353
If I wanted
a psychological evaluation,

193
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:53,092
I'd hire the guy we pay
to hypnotize us before depositions.

194
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:54,800
Now, get cracking!

195
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,813
<i>While Marshall examined
the Bro Code,</i>

196
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:59,563
<i>Lily's kindergarten class
welcomed a special guest.</i>

197
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,803
And with a little luck,
in a few days,

198
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:04,001
Farmer Frank's cold
will be all gone.

199
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:07,533
And that's why Farmer Frank's
breath smells like medicine.

200
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:10,821
- Right, Farmer Frank?
- You got it, toots.

201
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,872
Any last questions
for Farmer Frank? Yes.

202
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:16,621
Will we ever get to see
Missy the Goat again?

203
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:18,601
Ah, isn't that sweet!

204
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:21,050
Well, you know, honey,
right after this,

205
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:23,461
I'm gonna drop old Missy off
at the butcher shop.

206
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,521
And they're going to take
a great big knife...

207
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,172
<i>And Frank went on to traumatize
Lily's entire class</i>

208
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,721
<i>with a graphic explanation
of where meat comes from.</i>

209
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:35,761
So not one little scrap
of Missy goes to waste.

210
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:39,692
Ms. Aldrin,
please don't let them eat Missy.

211
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:51,493
I know, I know.
I already called an animal rescue,

212
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:53,862
and they're going to come
get her on Monday.

213
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:58,160
Monday?! Where's she going to sleep
and eat and go to the bathroom?!

214
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:02,962
Okay, where's she going
to sleep and eat?

215
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:05,672
I-I guess I'll keep her
up on the roof.

216
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,890
Look, call me crazy. I just...

217
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:11,021
I don't think having a goat
in the apartment is a good idea.

218
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,843
<i>And, boy, was I right,</i>

219
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:17,211
<i>because what Missy the Goat would go
on to do in that bathroom was so...</i>

220
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,371
<i>No, you know what?
I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

221
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,431
<i>We'll get there.</i>

222
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:22,563
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey.

223
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,430
You ready to, um...

224
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,402
Where'd the goat turd come from?

225
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:28,121
How'd you know
that was a goat turd?

226
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,213
Well, it was either that,
or a musk ox turd, and I figured,

227
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:33,783
what the hell would
a musk ox be doing in here?

228
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:36,662
Guess what your wife
brought home.

229
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,931
Attorney-client privilege.
I can't talk about it.

230
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,251
Talk about what?

231
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:42,322
Nothing.
How was your day?

232
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:44,620
Oh, goat turd on the floor, I see.
Is that new?

233
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,602
How does everyone know
that's a goat turd?

234
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:54,393
Barney told you.

235
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,301
I don't know what
you're talking about, madam.

236
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,171
Marshall, you can't look
me in the eye,

237
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:00,892
you're blushing, coughing,
and your hands are shaking.

238
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:02,613
Hey, Robin, come here.

239
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,153
Ted is never finding out about this,
you understand?

240
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:08,622
Because it never happened,
none of us are saying anything.

241
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:13,090
And don't even think about opening that
can until I'm out of the splash zone.

242
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:28,101
Oh, fantastic, you're here.

243
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,460
Give me the good news.

244
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,083
I'm sorry. You did too good
of a job writing this thing.

245
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:33,632
It's-it's iron-clad.

246
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,513
No!
Bad lawyer!

247
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:38,681
I need a loophole!

248
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:42,312
I want to feel better, Marshall!
I can't keep buying things!

249
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:46,181
I have six self-cleaning litterboxes
and I don't even have a kid.

250
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,780
Wait...
How about this?

251
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,720
Ted's probably broken
this thing himself, right?

252
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:53,733
And if he's broken the Bro Code,
then I'm off the hook.

253
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:56,511
I thought about that.
And I gotta say,

254
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:59,813
Ted has upheld this thing
time and time again.

255
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:01,963
For example, article 87:

256
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,583
"A bro shall at all times say yes."

257
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,282
So he saved you
from an avalanche?

258
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:08,081
Yes.

259
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:12,171
And he carried you six miles
to safety on his broken leg?

260
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:13,322
Yes.

261
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:16,190
And you're a pre-op transsexual
nightclub singer

262
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,300
who used to be a member
of the Russian Mob?

263
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:23,382
Da.

264
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,030
Article 29:

265
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:30,600
"A bro will in a timely manner alert his
bro to the existence of a girl fight."

266
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,460
Dude, two girls are fighting
at MacLaren's.

267
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,291
What?!

268
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:41,680
Yeah, yeah. It was crazy.
This one girl was like...

269
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:46,012
Article 53:

270
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:50,211
"A bro will, whenever possible,
provide his bro with protection."

271
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:53,483
- That feels nice.
- Good.

272
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,410
I just wish
we had some wine.

273
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:03,482
Yeah.

274
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,601
I wish we had
some wine, too.

275
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,211
Damn it, Marshall.

276
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:16,260
I'm not paying you to tell me
what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer!

277
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,152
The answer is in there!
Find it!

278
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,263
Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code,
and you know it.

279
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:23,513
The reason that you're upset
is because what you did was wrong.

280
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:25,543
And the only way you're ever
gonna feel any better about it

281
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,282
is if you tell Ted what you did.

282
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,701
What if he never wants
to talk to me again?

283
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:32,793
Well, I guess that's just a chance
you're gonna have to take.

284
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:36,243
<i>Which brings us
to April 25, 2008.</i>

285
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:37,871
<i>My 30th birthday,</i>

286
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:40,900
<i>or as it would come
to be referred to in later years:</i>

287
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:43,000
<i>The Day of the Goat.</i>

288
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,021
Hey, where are you?

289
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,893
I'm in the limo, right outside
of Ted's office.

290
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:48,402
Great. Well, everyone's here.
Stella just arrived

291
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:50,892
and there is something here
so awesome,

292
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,602
I'm not going to tell you what it is,
but you won't believe...

293
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:55,982
- Goat in a party hat?
- Damn it!

294
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,101
Well, you still gotta see it.

295
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:00,611
It's so much fun
having a goat at a party!

296
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,211
<i>In a few short hours,
Lily would come to regret those words.</i>

297
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:06,630
<i>But we'll get there.</i>

298
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:08,053
Uh, gotta go.
Here he comes.

298
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:08,800
Okay, bye.

299
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,202
- Hey.
- Hey.

299
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:12,602
Whoa, you guys went all out.

300
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:15,731
Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo,
five-minute warning!

301
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,213
Everyone get ready!

302
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:19,642
Oh, Missy, are you excited?

303
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:22,883
Yes, you are!

304
00:14:25,276 --> 00:14:26,980
Whoa, we're leaving the city

305
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,850
where the hell is this party?

306
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,742
Vegas.

307
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:37,050
Vegas? I thought
the party was on the rooftop.

308
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,142
Surprise!
Just a decoy, my friend.

309
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:40,371
So there's no roof party?

310
00:14:40,476 --> 00:14:42,531
Oh, no. There is.
We're just not going.

311
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:43,932
This is how good a friend I am.

312
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:47,010
They want you to spend your 30th
standing around drinking flat beer

313
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:50,022
ten feet above your living room.
But not me, bro.

314
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,770
I pulled out all the stops.

315
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:55,292
Private jet,
Valderrama suite at the Bellagio.

316
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,483
Steaks at BOA,
scotch at Ghostbar,

317
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:01,571
then two ringside seats
to watch Floyd Mayweather

318
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:03,790
go ten rounds with,
wait for it...

319
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:06,040
a grizzly bear!

320
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,443
- Take me home, Barney.
- No!

321
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:10,331
We have to go to Vegas.

322
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,352
Look, Ted, I didn't want
to say this, but...

323
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:17,642
there's something that I have
to tell you, and I wanted you to be

324
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,841
in the best possible frame of mind
before you heard it.

325
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:21,500
You slept with Robin.

326
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,191
- Ranjit!
- You slept with Robin?

327
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,230
Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!

328
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:39,302
When did you find out?

329
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:41,731
Hey, Robin. Come here!

330
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:43,370
What's up?

331
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:45,720
I was, uh, just going through
some old stuff and I...

332
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,341
Oh, crap!

333
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,443
Anyway, uh,
I came across this.

334
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:56,983
Oh, wow.
From our vacation in Vermont.

335
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:59,171
I don't know if you'd even want it,
but if you do, it's yours.

336
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:00,443
I slept with Barney!

337
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:01,771
What?

338
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,623
It was just one time, it wa...

339
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:08,630
it was the night that Simon dumped me
and I was in a really vulnerable place

340
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:11,643
I wanted to just pretend like it
never happened, but

341
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:14,083
I couldn't, and... I can't.

342
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:17,500
I just, I had to tell you.

343
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,832
I just hope that
we can still be friends.

344
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:24,633
Of course we can still be friends.

345
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:26,343
So you're not mad?

346
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:28,411
Well, I'm...

347
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,801
it's a little weird, but, um...

348
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:32,973
No, I'm not mad.

349
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,480
So you're not mad?

350
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:41,432
No, I'm not mad.

351
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:44,013
I mean, Robin and I
broke up a year ago.

352
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,292
We've both dated
lots of people since then.

353
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:47,871
I'm with Stella now.

354
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,401
Seriously,
I... I'm fine with this.

355
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,803
I'm so relieved
to hear you say that.

356
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:55,350
Yeah. Yeah.

357
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:58,553
Oh, hey, I just remembered, um,
my mom is coming into town next month.

358
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:01,292
Maybe you'd like
to nail her, too!

359
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:04,061
Where are they?!
I'm getting a cramp.

360
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,492
Marshall, can we keep the goat?

361
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:07,550
No.

362
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:09,983
But she's so cute and furry and soft.

363
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:12,652
Yeah, and she also sheds,
eats out of the garbage and

364
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:15,291
can't control her bowels. Why don't
we just call Duluth Mental Hospital

365
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:16,851
and say my Uncle Linus
can live with us?

366
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:19,790
Yeah, Lily, that may seem like
a good idea after a couple of drinks

367
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:22,233
but tomorrow morning you're going
to want this thing out of your house.

368
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,641
Oh, you should talk.
You slept with Barney.

369
00:17:24,748 --> 00:17:26,343
- Marshall!
- I'm sorry!

370
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,852
I couldn't take it anymore.

371
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:31,512
I can't believe you did that.
That's so gross.

372
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,780
Was it amazing?

373
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,782
What? I... Lily, really don't want
to talk about this.

374
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:41,620
I know, but it's Barney.
It's just hard not to be curious.

375
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,770
Did he have like devices and stuff?

376
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:44,710
Lily, come on.

377
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,232
- Hot wax?
- Stop it.

378
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:48,031
- Did he tie you to anything?
- That's enough.

379
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,341
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

380
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,150
Is he all smooth down there?

381
00:17:57,597 --> 00:18:01,411
Three billion women on the planet!
Three billion!

382
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,813
And you have to sleep with the one
that I dated for a year!

383
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,970
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?!

384
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,433
- Robin?!
- You think I'm proud of this?!

385
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:12,043
- I'm horrified that this happened.
- How did it happen? Huh?

386
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:15,110
Barney, I want to know.
Tell me exactly how it happened.

387
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:17,461
You mean...

388
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,082
what position?

389
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,993
Okay.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it.

390
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,901
- Hit him! Hit him, Ted!
- Stop!

391
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:26,860
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Stop!

392
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:29,902
Okay. Okay.
Yore pissed.

393
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:32,091
You deserve to be.
Fine. You know what?

394
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,931
One free shot. On me.
Anywhere but the face.

395
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:43,023
Who punches
someone in the groin?

396
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,292
Okay. Okay.
I deserved that.

397
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:50,130
I deserved that.

398
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,830
But what's important now is...

399
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:55,531
we're passed this whole
Robin thing now, right?

400
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:58,121
You think that this is
just about Robin?

401
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:59,663
This is about...

402
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:03,003
You know, I've seen you
do some bad stuff.

403
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:07,100
I mean some really terrible stuff
to a lot of different people.

404
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:08,801
I just always thought
there had to be a limit.

405
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:11,372
I always thought I was the limit.

406
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:14,750
You're always spouting off
these rules for bros.

407
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:18,103
Isn't one of them,
"don't do this"?

408
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,770
Yeah. And I broke it.
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,500
But, Ted...

410
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:27,293
seriously, this suite
at the Bellagio...

411
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:29,732
I am not going
to Vegas with you!

412
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,961
I'm not going to blow off
my friends and my girlfriend,

413
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,721
and spend my 30th birthday
in a strip club.

414
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:37,662
The fact that you think I would...

415
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,200
You know, Barney, earlier this week
I started putting things in a box

416
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:45,660
and that box was labeled
"stuff I have no use for anymore."

417
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:47,793
What does that mean?

418
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,601
It means...

419
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,933
maybe you belong in that box.

420
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:56,073
Are you saying you don't want
to be bros anymore?

421
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:59,312
I'm saying I don't want
to be friends anymore.

422
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,521
Okay, I'm going to
stop you right there,

423
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:05,621
because it seems like you're
about to say something

424
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,282
that's going to pretty much
ruin Vegas.

425
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:08,903
Ranjit, stop the car.

426
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:11,923
I'm getting a cab.

427
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:50,982
Surprise!

428
00:20:58,756 --> 00:20:59,913
<i>Oh, right, the goat.</i>

429
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,850
<i>So funny.
You're going to love this.</i>

430
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:04,741
<i>So later that night, the goat locked
himself in the bathroom and</i>

431
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:08,021
<i>was eating one of Robin's washcloths
and.. wait, hold on.</i>

432
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,400
<i>Robin wasn't living here
on my 30th birthday.</i>

433
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,713
<i>When did this happen?</i>

434
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:14,813
<i>Oh, wait, the goat was there
on my 31st birthday.</i>

435
00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:16,960
<i>Sorry, I totally got that wrong.</i>
