1
00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:04,821
<i>Now, kids, the spring of 2008 was a
complicated time in your old man's life.</i>

2
00:00:05,478 --> 00:00:08,139
<i>The last time I had seen Barney
was shortly after I found out</i>

3
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:10,243
<i>he had spent
the night with Robin.</i>

4
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,881
Are you saying you don't want
to be bros anymore?

5
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:15,415
I'm saying I don't want
to be friends anymore.

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,454
It's Barney.

7
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:22,672
Dude, seriously,
you need to stop calling me.

8
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:25,050
Ted, I'm sorry
I haven't returned your calls.

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,756
Yeah, I never called you.

10
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,130
You called me 15 times
and my parents twice.

11
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:31,032
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,389
I gotta let you go.

13
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:34,897
There's just too many
good wingmen out there.

14
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,312
Ted, are you crying?

15
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:40,062
No, I'm not.

16
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:42,233
Let it out. Let it out.

17
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:44,482
Good-bye, Barney.

18
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,442
So, are you two
back together?

19
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:49,741
I miss Barney.

20
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:52,770
I haven't high-fived anyone
in like a week.

21
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:55,262
I think I might be starting to lose
my fist bump callus.

22
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:57,701
Let me ask you something, Ted.

23
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,941
Why are you so much madder
at Barney than me?

24
00:01:00,046 --> 00:01:03,943
Yeah, she had just as much sex
with Barney as Barney had with her.

25
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:06,631
You know what?
I'm not sure that's true.

26
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:11,770
And I think I'd actually prefer it if
you were mad at me; this is too weird.

27
00:01:11,876 --> 00:01:13,411
I'm not mad at anybody.

28
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:17,102
I've forgiven you, and I've outgrown
Barney as a friend. It's that simple.

29
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:19,290
I'll tell you why he's not mad.

30
00:01:19,397 --> 00:01:21,103
It's 'cause he's so happy
with Stella.

31
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,140
<i>She was right.</i>

32
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:25,140
<i>Stella and I had been dating
for two months,</i>

33
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,313
<i>and things were
going really well.</i>

34
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:30,300
<i>She had met my friends
and passed with flying colors.</i>

35
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:31,860
<i>There was just
one little problem.</i>

36
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,191
You guys haven't had sex yet?!

37
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:38,703
When Marshall and I were
two months in, we were doing it 24/7.

38
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,993
I know, I was in the top bunk.

39
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,122
I also sat next to you guys
at football games.

40
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,632
So what are you guys waiting for?

41
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:47,873
I think she wants to make sure
we're serious first.

42
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:50,172
That's why she hasn't introduced me
to her daughter, either.

43
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,300
She wants to take things slow.

44
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,463
Wait...
so you haven't had sex

45
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,092
since, like... Thanksgiving.

46
00:01:57,138 --> 00:02:00,720
Do you know how many big federal
holidays have come and gone since then?

47
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:04,141
Ooh, baby, do you remember
Martin Luther King Day?

48
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:05,443
Yeah, I do.

49
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,490
We honored that dude big time.

50
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,812
Look, I'm crazy about this girl,
and if waiting is what it takes,

51
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,071
then I am fine with that.

52
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:16,172
On a totally unrelated note,
does anybody have any gum

53
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:19,161
or ice or a piece of bark
they're not chewing?

54
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,433
Hey, Barney,
new SkyMall came in.

55
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:29,170
So, uh...

56
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:33,340
Word around the blogosphere is
that you're looking for a new wingman.

57
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:35,302
I want to let you know
I am available.

58
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:38,072
Just say the word,
or don't even say the word.

59
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:40,280
Just do something
with your eyebrow.

60
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:44,810
Was that it?

61
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:49,940
No offense, Randy, but there's
a long list of candidates for this slot.

62
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:53,093
This slot is
Vice President of Awesome,

63
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:54,563
and you're, like,

64
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:57,203
Assistant Undersecretary
of Only Okay.

65
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:01,343
"Assistant Undersecretary
of Only Okay."

66
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,350
Thank you.
I won't let you down.

67
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,982
<i>So Uncle Barney began the search
for a new wingman.</i>

68
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,791
Pete! Barney Stinson.

69
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:11,250
Hey, I've been meaning to call you.
It's been a while.

70
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:14,462
Yeah, yeah, so listen. You should
meet me at MacLaren's tonight.

71
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,051
You're never gonna believe this:
I'm at the hospital.

72
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:19,300
Just had a baby daughter.

73
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:22,102
So what do you think,
9:30, 10:00?

74
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:27,310
Stapleton!
Barney Stinson.

75
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,403
What up, chief?

76
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,230
Need a new bro.
What do you say?

77
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:33,691
Dude, I'd love to, but right now
I'm bros with Doug Stein.

78
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:37,802
Oh, I understand.

79
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,731
Doug Stein's a good bro.

80
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,571
I'm happy for you.
Best of luck.

81
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:47,600
Crazy Willie!
Barney Stinson.

82
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:51,880
What up, B-Dog? Long time, no bro.
So we gonna tear it up tonight or what?

83
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:53,941
Yes, finally!

84
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,612
Here's what's on
the rock-it docket.

85
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:57,563
My wife and I put
the cheese out at 7:00,

86
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,702
Cranium at 8:00,
9:00 p.m. we watch 27 Dresses.

87
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,572
Everybody's home by 11:00.
Boo-yah!

88
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:09,670
Hello?

89
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:12,171
Hanging up on you
once wasn't enough.

90
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,360
So I lanced this thing
on this guy's back,

91
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,370
and I'll be honest with you,
I didn't even know what it was,

92
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:19,871
and then it exploded
like a volcano.

93
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,110
Pus everywhere.

94
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:24,490
Let's have sex.
Right now. I'll lock the door.

95
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,431
Oh, there's no lock on that door.

96
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:28,661
We can do it against the door.
It'll be hot!

97
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:31,173
It'll be like a three-way:
you, me, and the door.

98
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:34,501
Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird
between me and the door tomorrow.

99
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,820
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,722
We're waiting.
It's cool.

101
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:43,373
You've been so patient, Ted.

102
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:44,973
The truth is...

103
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:47,941
I'm kind of nervous.
I have a confession to make.

104
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:49,941
I was afraid of this.
You're 14.

105
00:04:52,536 --> 00:04:53,983
No, um...

106
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:57,350
It's kind of embarrassing,
but it's

107
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:59,650
a while since
I was intimate with anyone.

108
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:02,712
Wow, it's funny that you say that.

109
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,371
- Me, too.
- Really?

110
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:06,490
How long's it been for you?

111
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,333
It's been a while.

112
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:10,660
Tell me.

113
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:15,042
Me, too!

114
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,303
It's been five months for you, too?

115
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:20,340
Five years?!

116
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:26,733
How I Met Your Mother 3x18
<i>- Rebound Bro -</i>

120
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,973
Wow. Stella hasn't
had sex since 2003.

121
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,590
Let's put this in context.

122
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,571
The last time Stella had sex,

123
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:45,831
the movie, Seabiscuit,
had just galloped into theaters...

124
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,083
and our hearts.

125
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:49,913
Five years?

126
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:52,073
God, if I even went one year,

127
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,623
I would be out on the street
selling it for a nickel.

128
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:57,563
The last time Stella had sex,

129
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,960
the world was just
learning about SARS.

130
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:03,802
Well, Ted, what else did she say? Did
she give you any kind of explanation?

131
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:06,981
Look, after Lucy was born,
I dated a little,

132
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,972
but it was hard to find a guy
I could trust enough.

133
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:12,233
Sooner or later, every one of them
gave me a reason not to.

134
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:15,602
But nobody in five years?

135
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:19,552
Look, Ted, guys regret
the girls they didn't sleep with.

136
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:21,353
Girls regret the guys
they do sleep with.

137
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:24,953
And for the past five years,
I've had no regrets.

138
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,730
Ted, you're staring at
my boobs.

139
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,001
In my defense,
they were staring at me.

140
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:37,420
So what does this mean for you?
Is she ever gonna want to get intimate?

141
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:38,731
Actually...

142
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:41,840
But the truth is, I really do
want to do this with you.

143
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,470
I don't think I'd regret it at all.

144
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,762
Your pillow talk's a little rusty.

145
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,359
You know what I mean, Ted.
I'm ready.

146
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:51,087
That's great.

147
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:54,540
Like, "right now" ready?

148
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,453
So her sister's driving up
to baby-sit Lucy,

149
00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:00,331
and we're getting a hotel room
in the city Saturday night.

150
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:02,223
The last time Stella had sex,

151
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,151
The Da Vinci Code
had just come out.

152
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,822
Well, that doesn't seem
like that long ago.

153
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,032
Not the movie, the book.

154
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:11,570
It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

155
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:12,940
You know what?
It's not.

156
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:16,663
This woman needs it bad. Anything
you do is going to be fireworks.

157
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,630
I remember my longest drought...

158
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:22,612
<i>It was that summer
I lived in San Francisco.</i>

159
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:26,331
<i>I hadn't had been with Marshall
in two months and 19 days.</i>

160
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,021
Oh, San Francisco.

161
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:42,732
I don't know Lily, after five years, her
expectations have gotta be pretty high.

162
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,051
Notable deaths in 2003...

163
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:48,351
Oh, my God...

164
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:50,602
Nell Carter.

165
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,482
Did you guys know that
Nell Carter had died?

166
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,751
I'm really gonna have to bring
my A-game to satisfy this woman.

167
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:59,900
Yeah, it'll be pretty hard
now that she's dead.

168
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,132
Not Nell Carter,
Stella.

169
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:04,703
Dude, relax.
It's all about expectations management.

170
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:06,383
Do you know why I hated
Jerry Maguire so much?

171
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:08,251
Because you're dead inside?

172
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,240
No, because you built it up
for, like, two weeks,

173
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,081
saying it was
the greatest movie ever.

174
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,183
With Stella, do the opposite:
lower expectations.

175
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:19,522
Right, right, and then no matter
what happens, she'll be happy.

176
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:23,430
Hey, buddy.

177
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,570
I'm married, Barney.
I cannot be your new wingman.

178
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:32,413
No.

179
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,130
Hey, Randy. Could you come in
here for a minute?

180
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:46,251
Good news.

181
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:48,270
I'm calling you up to the majors.

182
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,920
Starting tomorrow night,

183
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,303
how would you like to be
my new wingman?

184
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:57,771
Just need to check my calendar.
Be right back.

185
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:22,670
Tomorrow works.

186
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:29,401
I have a surprise appetizer
for us today. Check it out.

187
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,570
Potato skins.

188
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:33,360
- Fancy.
- Yeah, right?

189
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,951
God, it's been forever
since I had potato skins.

190
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,063
I remember them as being pretty much
the most delicious things ever.

191
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,351
That's surprising.

192
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,781
- What?
- This potato skin.

193
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:52,152
It's good, but not nearly as good
as I'd built it up to be in my head.

194
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:56,513
Even though this potato skin
performed admirably,

195
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:58,622
and is a totally respectable size...

196
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:03,182
I couldn't enjoy it because
of my own unrealistic expectations.

197
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:05,922
Ted, I see what you're doing.

198
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,092
You're trying to lower
my expectations for tonight.

199
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,602
- Is this a length thing?
- No.

200
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:13,173
- Quick on the draw?
- No.

201
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,642
- Unexpected number of testicles?
- No!

202
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,371
It's just that
this is a big deal for you.

203
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,063
I mean, it's like
your virginity: the sequel.

204
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,902
Virginity 2: Electric Boogaloo?

205
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:25,910
Exactly, and I don't want
to mess it up.

206
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,362
I don't want you to ever
wonder if I was worth it.

207
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:32,083
Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it.

208
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:33,680
Stop worrying.

209
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:35,783
It's you and me.

210
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:38,112
It already has everything it needs.

211
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:44,392
"Unexpected number of testicles?"

212
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:46,953
It happens.
I knew a guy in med school...

213
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,633
We used to joke that he was one ball
away from getting walked.

214
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:57,721
What up, Bro-seph Lieberman?

215
00:10:58,097 --> 00:11:02,473
No, uh-uh. Randy,
we never use the word "bro"

216
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,970
in the name of a failed Democratic
vice presidential candidate.

217
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:11,111
Good-bye, "Geraldine Ferrar-bro."

218
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:15,260
You know what?
I'm excited about this, Randy.

219
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,371
You will be my next masterpiece.
It's like with Ted.

220
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,243
When I first met him,
he was an even bigger loser than you.

221
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:23,161
What a loser.

222
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:27,273
But tonight, I am going to make you
the greatest wingman

223
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,712
in the history of wingmen.

224
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,663
Oh, it's gonna be easier
than you think, bro.

225
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,930
Yeah, I've been reading
your blog for years.

226
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,683
You are like a God to me.

227
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:39,431
That's why tonight
is going to be legendary...

228
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:40,803
wait for it...

229
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,782
dary.

230
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:49,150
Okay, Randy, let's do this.

231
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:54,482
- You ready?
- Yes.

232
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:57,452
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- What? What's the matter?

233
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:01,370
Nothing.
Let's do this.

234
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,121
No, no, no, no, no, please, please,
please. Just wait. Just wait.

235
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:07,962
- Just wait. Just wait!
- Randy, what are you doing?

236
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,700
Dripping with game,
that's what I'm doing.

237
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,752
Okay, let's go.
No. Yes. No!

238
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:16,722
Randy, listen to me:
you can do this, okay?

239
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:19,011
Oh, I don't know.
Are those girls really that hot?

240
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:22,321
Yeah, they're hot.
Let's do this. Okay!

241
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:27,312
Hey, ladies.

242
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,520
Have you met...

243
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,010
- Hey.
- Hey!

244
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,043
So, here's the plan.

245
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:42,720
Take a horse-drawn carriage through
the park, and it just so happens

246
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,161
the Philharmonic is playing
an open-air...

247
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:45,302
Ted.
Five years.

248
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:46,643
- Straight to the hotel?
- Straight to the hotel.

249
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,022
I'll get my bag.

250
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:52,330
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

251
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:53,201
Hey.

252
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:55,710
So, uh,
looking forward to tonight?

253
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:59,173
Yeah. Definitely. It's been such
a long time since I've had a night out.

254
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,441
Yeah, we heard.

255
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:05,011
I would explode if it had been that
long since I had a "night out."

256
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,541
This one wakes me up
at 4:00 a.m. sometimes

257
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,983
just to have a little "night out."

258
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:13,651
Um, what are you guys
talking about?

259
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:18,531
Nothing. Pizza.
What are you talking about?

260
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:20,652
Hey, guys.

261
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:23,161
Ted, you told them, didn't you?

262
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:24,762
Told them what?

263
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:28,370
You told them that
I haven't had sex in five years.

264
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,623
You haven't had sex in five years?!

265
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:38,222
That is a shocking revelation that
we're just finding out about right now.

266
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:45,312
Stella, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have told them.

267
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,352
But they're my best friends.
I tell them everything.

268
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:49,043
I didn't even think about it.

269
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:51,680
Ted, that was so personal.

270
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,443
- Now your friends think I'm a freak.
- No, they don't.

271
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,021
Look, I realize it's weird, okay?

272
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,192
Not many people go
five years without having sex.

273
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:00,940
13 years?!

274
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:02,683
I peaked really young.

275
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,001
That's why it was difficult
for me to tell you.

276
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:07,992
But I did tell you because
I thought that I could trust you.

277
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,291
You can trust me.

278
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:10,913
Obviously, I can't.

279
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,062
You know, there's always a reason
not to sleep with a guy, and

280
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,521
you just gave me yours.

281
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:20,013
Wait, did I give you a reason,
or were you looking for one?

282
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,051
Why would I be looking for one?

283
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,500
Because things are getting
serious between us,

284
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:26,892
and that scares you.

285
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:31,753
Good night, Ted.

286
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:36,940
Okay, Randy,

287
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:39,511
now, tell me,
without looking at your hand,

288
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,283
what are the three beginner techniques
for picking up a woman at a bar?

289
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,732
Isolate her from her friends;

290
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,913
repeat her name in conversation;

291
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,411
subtly put her down.

292
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:50,623
Excellent.

293
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,891
Now...
let's put those to use.

294
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,102
I'm right behind you.

295
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,010
Hi, I'm Randy.
What's your name?

296
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:06,451
- Haley.
- Haley.

297
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,973
Haley, that's a pretty name, Haley.
Haley...

298
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:10,902
come here, Haley.

299
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:13,482
Okay.

300
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:18,611
Haley, you are a fat ugly whore.

301
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,072
I'm sorry, Barney.

302
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,622
So you got a drink thrown in your face.
Happens to me all the time.

303
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,443
Pretty soon you'll be able
to anticipate it,

304
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,233
and when you do?
Free drink.

305
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,510
Oh, hey.

306
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:36,790
We got two live ones.

307
00:15:36,897 --> 00:15:38,820
New plan: this time
follow my lead.

308
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:43,510
Evening, ladies.

309
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:46,860
Oh, I like your broach.
What is that?

310
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:49,761
Oh, it's a koala bear.
I think they're adorable.

311
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:51,472
No way!

312
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,691
My friend Randy here is the leading
expert on koala bears in Australia!

313
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,690
He's in town working with
the Bronx Zoo.

314
00:15:57,797 --> 00:16:00,622
You are?
That is so cool!

315
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:04,142
What is your favorite thing
about koala bears?

316
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,692
Their...

317
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,870
meat is delicious.

318
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:19,952
- I'm sorry, Barney.
- Ah, it's okay.

319
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:22,923
New plan:
we need to get you comfortable

320
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,170
just saying words to women.

321
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,053
Now, there's no reason to be nervous,
because my friend, Robin,

322
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,381
has agreed to help out.

323
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,662
Because you threatened to put a video
of us on the Internet,

324
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,422
which I'm still not
convinced you have.

325
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,593
Right, which is why you came
all the way from Brooklyn at midnight.

326
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:38,310
Now Randy,

327
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:40,131
let's keep it simple.

328
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,503
Just start by introducing yourself.

329
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,031
Hi.
My name's Randy.

330
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,192
Hi, Randy.

331
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,703
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

332
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:50,653
- Good, thank you.
- Great.

333
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:54,620
You're doing really, really well.
Now ask her what she's doing later.

334
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,732
What are you doing later?

335
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,650
Yeah, your nose is bleeding
like a faucet.

336
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:05,032
Oh, God. This happens every time
I get an erection. I am so sorry.

337
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:11,192
Okay.
Okay, new plan.

338
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,693
We wrap his face in gauze
so he can't bleed or talk.

339
00:17:14,795 --> 00:17:16,293
- You are the woman...
- Barney,

340
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:19,143
why are you so desperate
to have this happen?

341
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,233
I'm a wingman.
That's what wingmen do.

342
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:24,580
Is it possible that you're trying
to fill the void

343
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:27,863
of losing Ted by rushing into
a new wingman relationship?

344
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:29,730
What are you saying?

345
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:32,742
I'm saying that Randy
is your rebound bro.

346
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,582
No.
That's crazy.

347
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,742
What Randy and I have is real.

348
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:42,473
No, it's not, Barney.
And even if you got Randy laid tonight,

349
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:46,420
would it feel anywhere near as
meaningful as when you got Ted laid?

350
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,711
He was just so happy
the next morning, you know?

351
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:50,592
I know.

352
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,661
All right.
It hasn't clotted but I think

353
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,100
it's pretty much
draining backwards now.

354
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,502
Randy.

355
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,901
I've been thinking,

356
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:03,960
this isn't working out.

357
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:06,613
Yeah, I figured.

358
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,112
I knew I couldn't fly this close
to the sun without getting burned.

359
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:13,580
This is the story of my life.
I always let people down.

360
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:16,040
You, my dad, the chief.

361
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:17,370
The chief?

362
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:19,693
Yeah, I was a cop
for like three months.

363
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:22,263
But I got kicked off the force
because I screwed up so much

364
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,123
I was an insurance liability.

365
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:27,963
You were a New York City police officer
and you didn't tell me?

366
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,552
Wow!
Did you ever shoot anybody?

367
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,850
- Only all the time.
- But not himself.

368
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:34,570
- And not in the foot.
- Actually...

369
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,681
- Ah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
- but nothing.

370
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:40,150
I don't think there's anything
hotter than a cop.

371
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:42,843
Are you okay?
Your nose is bleeding.

372
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,491
Old injury. The bullet's still
lodged in his sinus.

373
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,472
Oh, my God!
You know what?

374
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:51,993
I live right around the corner. Can I
take you to my place and fix you up?

375
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:57,071
That would be very nice.

376
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:00,873
Have a great time, you two.

377
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,803
<i>Oh, my God, thank you.
I can't thank you enough.</i>

378
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:08,672
I am the greatest wingman of all time.

379
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,480
Ted doesn't know what he's missing.

380
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,952
You had to mention Ted, didn't you?

381
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,983
Okay, I really overreacted
last night. I'm sorry.

382
00:19:27,128 --> 00:19:30,903
Maybe I have some trust issues,
but believe me, I have earned them.

383
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:35,863
You said that I was looking for a reason
for this whole thing to fall apart.

384
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:38,280
Well, you're onto me, Ted.

385
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:41,792
That's actually something
that I do a lot.

386
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:45,000
But I'm not going to
do that with you.

387
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:46,803
Ted...

388
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:48,292
I'm in.

389
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:52,302
This is awkward.
I have a girl here.

390
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:02,931
Come on.

391
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:06,110
There is something that
I'm ready to do with you.

392
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:14,040
Ted, this is Lucy.

393
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,251
- Hi, Lucy.
- Lucy, this is Ted.

394
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:18,352
<i>Stella and I thought our relationship</i>

395
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:20,681
<i>was going to take
a big step that weekend.</i>

396
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:23,641
<i>Turned out,
it took an even bigger one.</i>

397
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:30,332
- She's sound asleep.
- Oh. She is so great.

398
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,543
I think so.

399
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,141
So, uh, I was thinking,

400
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:37,492
my sister is in town
until tomorrow.

401
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:40,222
And, uh, there's a motel
just down the turnpike.

402
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,671
- Wow, that was amazing!
- Oh, yeah.

403
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,592
What are you doing?

404
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:55,441
I gotta call Marshall and Lily.
Tell them about this.
