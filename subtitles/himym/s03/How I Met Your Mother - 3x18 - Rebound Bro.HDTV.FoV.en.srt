1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Now kids,

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,100
the spring of 2008 was complicated time in you old man's life.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,790
The last time I had seen Barney

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,700
was shortly after I found out he has spent night with Robbin.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,600
Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,900
I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,400
It's Barney.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,000
Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Ted I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah I never called you,

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,300
you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,600
I'm sorry, I gotta let you go.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's just too many good wingmen out there.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Ted, are you crying?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
No, I am not.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
Sh....let it out, let it out.

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,700
Goodbye Barney.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,500
-So are you two back together?  -No.

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,200
I miss Barney.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,400
I haven't "high five" with anyone like a week.

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,500
I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Let me asking you something Ted.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why are you so much madder at Barney than me.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,300
Yeah, She had just as much sex with barney

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,800
as barney had with her.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,800
You know what? I'm not sure that's true.

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,000
I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. 

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,200
This is too wierd.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. 

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,300
And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. That's simple.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
I will tell you why he is not mad. 

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Because he is so happy with stella.

33
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,400
She was right.

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,900
Stella and I had been dating for two months.

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
And things were going really well.

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,000
She had mat my friends in past for flying colors.

37
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,000
There was just one little problem.

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,700
You guys haven't had sex yet?!

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,600
When marshall and I were two months. 

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
We were doing it 24/7.

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,900
I know. I was in the top bunk.

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Also sat next to you at football games.

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,500
So what you guys waiting for?

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,900
I... She wants to make sure we are serious first, 

45
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either.

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,700
She wants to take things slow.

47
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,000
Wait, So you haven't had sex since like Thanks Giving.

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,400
Do you know how many big federal holidays

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
have come and gone since then.

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,200
Oh, baby, Do you remember Martin Luther King Day

51
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,700
Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,400
Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, 

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm fine with that.

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,300
And totally unrelated note. 

55
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,800
Does anybody have gamma icer

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,300
or a piece of bark that you are not chewing.

57
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,500
Hey Barney, new sky mall came in.

58
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,300
So Worldaround blog's fear is 

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,500
you are looking for a new wingman. 

60
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I wanna let you know, I am available.

61
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Just say the word, or don't even say the word. 

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,900
Just do something with your eyebrow.

63
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,400
Was that it?

64
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,400
No offence Randy, 

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
but there is long list of candidates for this slot.

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
The slot is vice president of awosome.

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,300
And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Assistant under secretary of only ok

69
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Thank you, I will not let you down.

70
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,100
So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
-Pitt, Barney Stinson. -Hey

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,500

73
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,200
Yeah yeah, so listen, 

74
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,600
you should meet me in mclaren tonight.

75
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. 

76
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
Just had a baby daughter.

77
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,400
So What do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Starry Porten, Barney stinson.

79
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
What up, chef.

80
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,500
I need a new bro, what do you say?

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Dude, I'd love to, But now I'm bro with Duck Stan.

82
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,700
Oh, I understand.

83
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,400
Duck Stan is a good bro.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,900
I'm happy for you. Best of luck.

85
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,800
Crazy Willie. Barney Stinson.

86
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,100
What up B dog, long time no bro, 

87
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes Finally.

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Here is what on the rocket tocket.

90
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,700
My wife is gonna put cheese out at seven.

91
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,000
9pm we watch 27 dresses. 

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Everybody is home by 11:00. Booya.

93
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,400
-Hello  -Hanging up on you once wasn't enough.

94
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,560
So I lanced this thing  on this guy's back,

95
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,330
and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was,

96
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,000
and then it exploded like a volcano.

97
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,330
Pus everywhere.

98
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's have sex.

99
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,330
Right now.I'll lock the door.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Oh, there's no lock on that door.

101
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,400
We can do it against the door.It'll be hot!

102
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,460
It'll be like a three-way: you, me, and the door.

103
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,200
Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird

104
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,730
between me and the door tomorrow.

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,930
We're waiting. It's cool.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,700
 You've been so patient, Ted.

108
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,200
The truth is...

109
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm kind of nervous.

110
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,700
 I have a confession to make.

111
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
 I was afraid of this.

112
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,060
You're 14.

113
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,200
 No, um...

114
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,860
It's kind of embarrassing,but it's been a while

115
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,860
since I was intimate with anyone.

116
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,930
Wow, it's funny that you say that.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,730
Me, too.

118
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,230
Really?

119
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,760
How long's it been for you?

120
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,560
It's been a while.

121
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,930
Tell me.

122
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,260
Me, too!

123
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,400
 It's been five months  for you, too?

124
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,600
Five years?!

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,400


126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,700


127
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,700
Wow.

128
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,860
Stella hasn't had  sex since 2003.

129
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,660
Let's put this in context.

130
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,600
The last time Stella had sex,the movie, <i>Seabiscuit,</i>

131
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,160
had just galloped into theaters... and our hearts.

132
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,930
Five years?

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,900
 God, if I even went <i>one</i> year,

134
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,700
I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.

135
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,330
The last time Stella had sex,

136
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,060
the world was just learning about SARS.

137
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,730
Well, Ted, what else did she say?

138
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,960
Did she give you any kind of explanation?

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,000
Look, after Lucy was born,I dated a little,

140
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,030
 but it was hard to find a guy  I could trust enough.

141
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,900
Sooner or later, every one of them

142
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,300
gave me a reason not to.

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,660
  But nobody in five years?

144
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,100
Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with.

145
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,330
Girls regret the guys  they <i>do</i> sleep with.

146
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,460
And for the past  five years,

147
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,000
 I've had no regrets.

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Ted, you're staring at my boobs.

149
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,100
In my defense,   they were staring at me.

150
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,530
So what does this mean for you?

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,500
Is she ever gonna want to get intimate?

152
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,760
 Actually...

153
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,560
But the truth is,I really do

154
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,900
want to do this with you.

155
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,530
 I don't think  I'd regret it at all.

156
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,860
 Your pillow talk's a little rusty.

157
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,400
You know what I mean, Ted. I'm ready.

158
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,900
 That's great.

159
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,500
Like, "right now" ready?

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,330
 So her sister's driving up   to baby-sit Lucy,

161
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,530
and we're getting a hotel room  in the city Saturday night.

162
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,230
The last time  Stella had sex,

163
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,200
<i>The Da Vinci Code</i>  had just come out.

164
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,900
Well, that doesn't seem  like that long ago.

165
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,100
Not the movie, the book.

166
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,930
 Wow.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,300
It's a lot of pressure,   isn't it?

168
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,300
You know what? It's not.

169
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,730
This woman needs it bad.

170
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,660
Anything you do is going to be fireworks.

171
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,800
I remember my longest drought...

172
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,430
  <i>It was that summer I lived</i>   <i>in San Francisco.</i>

173
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,530
 <i>I hadn't had been with Marshall</i>   <i>in two months and 19 days.</i>

174
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,700
Oh, San Francisco.

175
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,700
I don't know, Lily,after five years,

176
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
her expectations  have gotta be pretty high.

177
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,460
 Notable deaths  in 2003...

178
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,930
Oh, my God...   Nell Carter.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,460
Did you guys know  that Nell Carter had died?

180
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,460
I'm really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.

181
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,900
 Yeah, it'll be pretty hard  now that she's dead.

182
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,130
Not Nell Carter-- Stella.

183
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,500
Dude, relax.

184
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,300
It's all about expectations management.

185
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,400
Do you know why I hated <i>Jerry Maguire</i> so much?

186
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,200
 Because you're dead inside?

187
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,160
No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks,

188
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,100
  saying it was the greatest movie ever.

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,230
With Stella, do the opposite:  lower expectations.

190
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,130
Right, right, and then no matter what happens,

191
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
she'll be happy

192
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,600
 Hey, buddy.

193
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm married, Barney.I cannot be your new wingman.

194
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,460
No.

195
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,960
Hey, Randy.

196
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,160
Could you come in here for a minute?

197
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,300
 Good news.

198
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,830
 I'm calling you up to the majors.

199
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,830
Starting tomorrow night,

200
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,330
 how would you like  to be my new wingman?

201
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Uh...

202
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,800
Just need to check my calendar. Be right back.

203
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,330
Tomorrow works.

204
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,400
I have a surprise appetizer for us today.

205
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,730
Check it out.

206
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,260
Potato skins.

207
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,400
Fancy.

208
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,730
Yeah, right?

209
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,630
God, it's been forever since I had potato skins.

210
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,900
I remember them as being

211
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,330
 pretty much the most delicious things ever.

212
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,300
Huh.

213
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,860
That's surprising.

214
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,560
What?

215
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,730
This potato skin.

216
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,960
It's good

217
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,360
but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head.

218
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,560
Even though this potato skin performed admirably,

219
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,600
and is a totally respectable size...

220
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,330
I couldn't enjoy it

221
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,760
because of my own unrealistic expectations.

222
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,930
Hmm, Ted, I see  what you're doing.

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
You're trying to lower

224
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,100
 my expectations for tonight.

225
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,230
-Is this a length thing?  -No.

226
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,200
-Quick on the draw?  -No.

227
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,660
-Unexpected number of testicles?  -No!

228
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,260
It's just that this is a big deal for you.

229
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,060
I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel.

230
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,830
Virginity 2: Electric Boogaloo?

231
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up.

232
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,430
I don't want you to ever wonder if I was worth it.

233
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,860
Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it.

234
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,330
Stop worrying.

235
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,830
It's you and me.

236
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,560
It already has everything it needs.

237
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,100
"Unexpected number of testicles?"

238
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,330
It happens. I knew a guy in med school...

239
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,630
We used to joke that he was one ball away from getting walked.

240
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,700
Hey.

241
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,730
What up, Bro-seph Lieberman?

242
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,330
No, uh-uh.

243
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,760
Randy, we never use  the word "bro" in the name

244
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,630
of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.

245
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,130
Good-bye, "Geraldine Ferrar-bro."

246
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,060
You know what?

247
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm excited  about this, Randy.

248
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,400
You will be my next masterpiece.

249
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,400
It's like with Ted.

250
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,860
 When I first met him,

251
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,230
he was an even bigger loser than you.

252
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,200
What a loser.

253
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,500
But tonight, I am going  to make you

254
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
the greatest wingman  in the history of wingmen.

255
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro.

256
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,630
Yeah, I've been reading  your blog for years.

257
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,260
  You are like a god to me.

258
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,200
That's why tonight is going to be legendary...

259
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,200
wait for it...

260
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,360
dary.

261
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,160
Okay, Randy, let's do this.

262
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,760
Okay.

263
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,200
You ready?

264
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,230
Yes.

265
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

266
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,360
What? What's  the matter?

267
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,330
Nothing.

268
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,260
Let's do this.

269
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,100
No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please.

270
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
Just wait. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait!

271
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,000
Randy, what are  you doing?

272
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,530
Dripping with game,that's what I'm doing.

273
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,460
Okay, let's go. No. Let's...

274
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,800
Yes. No!

275
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,400
Randy, listen to me: you can do this, okay?

276
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,960
Oh, I don't know. Are those girls really that hot?

277
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,530
Yeah, they're hot. Let's do this.

278
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Okay!

279
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,860
Hey, ladies.

280
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,560
Have you met...

281
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,860
-Hey. -Hey!

282
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,500
So, here's the plan.

283
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,160
Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park,

284
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,730
and it just so happens

285
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,200
-the Philharmonic is playing  an open-air... -Ted.

286
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,660
Five years.

287
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,660
-Straight to the hotel? -Straight to the hotel.

288
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,030
I'll get my bag.

289
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,630
Hey, guys.

290
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,900
Hey. 

291
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,660
So, uh, looking forward to tonight?

292
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,360
Yeah. Definitely.

293
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,200
It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.

294
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,200
Yeah, we heard.

295
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,430
I would explode if it had been that long

296
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,900
since I had a "night out."

297
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,000
This one wakes me up at 4 am sometimes

298
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,600
just to have a little "night out." 

299
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,600
Um, what are you guys talking about?

300
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,900
Nothing.

301
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,100
Pizza.

302
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,160
What are you talking about?

303
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,300
Hey, guys.

304
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,800
Ted, you told them,  didn't you?

305
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,900
Told them what?

306
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,400
You told them

307
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,030
that I haven't had  sex in five years.

308
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,730
You haven't had sex in five years?!

309
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,130
That is a shocking revelation

310
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,360
that we're just finding out right now!

311
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,800
Stella, I'm sorry.

312
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,160
I shouldn't have told them.

313
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,100
But they're my best friends. I tell them everything.

314
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,430
I-I didn't even think about it.

315
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,230
Ted, that was so personal.

316
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,260
Plus, now your friends  think I'm a freak.

317
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,560
No, they don't.

318
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,860
Look, I realize it's weird, okay?

319
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,130
Not many people go five years without having sex.

320
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,860
13 years?!

321
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,760
I peaked really young.

322
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,600
That's why it was difficult  for me to tell you.

323
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,930
But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.

324
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,230
You can trust me.

325
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,630
Obviously, I can't.

326
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,500
You know, there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy,

327
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,360
and you just gave me yours.

328
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,100
Wait, did I give you a reason,

329
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,960
or were you looking for one?

330
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,960
Why would be looking for one?

331
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,960
 Because things are getting  serious between us,

332
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,760
and that scares you.

333
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,530
Good night, Ted.

334
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,030
Okay, Randy, now,

335
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,630
tell me, without looking at your hand,

336
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,160
are the three beginner techniques

337
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,800
for picking up a woman at a bar?

338
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,860
Isolate her from her friends;

339
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,200
repeat her name in conversation;

340
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,230
subtly put her down.

341
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,530
Excellent.

342
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,300
 Now...

343
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,700
let's put those to use.

344
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,730
  I'm right  behind you.

345
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,860
Hi, I'm Randy.

346
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,930
What's your name?

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,030
Haley.

348
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
Haley.

349
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,630
Haley, that's a pretty name, Haley.

350
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,200
Haley...

351
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,930
come here, Haley.

352
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,430
Um... okay.

353
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,530
Haley, you are a fat ugly whore.

354
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry, Barney.

355
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,860
Eh, so you got a drink thrown in your face.

356
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,460
Happens to me all the time.

357
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,000
Pretty soon you'll be  able to anticipate it,

358
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,100
and when you do?  Free drink.

359
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,430
We got two live ones.

360
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,060
New plan: this time follow my lead.

361
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,460
Evening, ladies.

362
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,530
Oh, I like your broach.

363
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,700
What is that?

364
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,400
Oh, it's a koala bear.

365
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,700
I think they're adorable.

366
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,300
No way!

367
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
My friend randy here is the leading expert

368
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,360
On koala bears in australia!

369
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,360
He's in town working with the bronx zoo.

370
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,400
You are?

371
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,430
That is so Cool!

372
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,830
Okay, what is your favorite thing about koala bears?

373
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Their...

374
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,860
Meat is delicious.

375
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,430
I'm sorry, barney.

376
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,600
Ah, it's okay.

377
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,760
New plan: We need to get you comfortable

378
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,000
Just saying words to women.

379
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,000
Now, there's no reason to be nervous,

380
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,000
Because my friend, robin, has agreed to help out.

381
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,330
Because you threatened to put a video of us on the internet,

382
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,830
Which I'm still not convinced you have.

383
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,700
Right, which is why you came all the way

384
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,700
From brooklyn at midnight.

385
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,130
Now randy,

386
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,130
Let's keep it Simple.

387
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,530
Just start by introducing Yourself.

388
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,030
Hi.

389
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,960
My name's randy.

390
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,130
Hi, randy.

391
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,500
How are you?

392
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,630
I'm good. how are you?

393
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,460
-Good, thank you. -great.

394
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,800
You're doing really, really well.

395
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,800
Now ask her what she's doing later.

396
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,830
What are you doing later?

397
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,160
Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.

398
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,800
Oh, god.

399
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,630
This happens every time I get an erection.

400
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,830
I am so sorry.

401
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,260
Okay.

402
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,300
Okay, new plan.

403
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,900
We wrap his face in gauze  so he can't bleed or talk.

404
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,330
You are the woman...

405
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,500
Barney, why are you so desperate to have this happen?

406
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm a wingman.

407
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,130
That's what wingmen do.

408
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,830
Is it possible

409
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,130
That you're trying to fill the void of losing ted

410
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,800
By rushing into a new wingman relationship?

411
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,300
What are you saying?

412
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,660
I'm saying that randy is your rebound bro.

413
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,130
No.

414
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,630
That's crazy.

415
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,630
What randy and I have is real.

416
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,000
No, it's not, barney.

417
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,030
And even if you got randy laid tonight,

418
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,860
Would it feel anywhere near as meaningful

419
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,360
As when you got ted laid?

420
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,700
He was just so happy the next morning, you know?

421
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,530
I know.

422
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,760
All right.

423
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,130
It hasn't clotted,

424
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,030
But I think it's pretty much draining backwards now.

425
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,060
Randy.

426
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,060
I've been thinking,

427
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,030
Is isn't working out.

428
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,060
Yeah, I figured.

429
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,330
I knew I couldn't fly this close to the sun

430
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,530
Without getting burned.

431
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,030
This is the story of my life.

432
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,530
I always let people down.

433
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,900
You, my dad, the chief.

434
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,100
The chief?

435
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,230
Yeah, I was a cop for like three months.

436
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,730
But I got kicked off the force

437
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,600
Because I screwed up so much I was an insurance liability.

438
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,600
You were a new york city police officer

439
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,860
And you didn't tell me?

440
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,200
Did you ever shoot anybody?

441
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,460
Only all the time.

442
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,730
But not himself.

443
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,430
And not in the foot.

444
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,300
-Actually...   -ah, bah, bah,   bah, bah.

445
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,600
But nothing.

446
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,600
I don't think there's anything hotter than a cop.

447
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,260
Are you okay?

448
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,600
Your nose is bleeding.

449
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,030
Uh, old injury.

450
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,830
The bullet's still lodged in his sinus.

451
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,860
Oh, my god!

452
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,160
You know what?

453
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,400
I live right around the corner.

454
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,830
Can I take you to my place

455
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,960
And fix you up?

456
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,700
That would be very nice.

457
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,530
Have a great time, you two.

458
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Oh, my god, thank you.   I can't thank you enough.

459
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,600
I am the greatest wingman of all time.

460
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,700
Ted doesn't know what he's missing.

461
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,730
You had to mention ted,  didn't you?

462
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,760
Okay, I really overreacted last night.

463
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,930
I'm sorry.

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,200
Maybe I have some trust issues,

465
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,330
But believe me, I have earned them.

466
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,500
You said that I was looking for a reason

467
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,500
For this whole thing to fall apart.

468
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,200
Well, you're onto me, ted.

469
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,630
That's actually something that I do a lot.

470
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,930
But I'm not going to do that with you.

471
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,230
Ted... I'm in.

472
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,530
This is awkward.

473
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,860
I have a girl here.

474
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,800
So...

475
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,860
Come on.

476
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,600
There is something that I'm ready to do with you.

477
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,900
Ted, this Lucy.

478
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,900
-Hi, lucy.  -lucy, this is ted.

479
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,900
Stella and I thought our relationship

480
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,230
Was going to take a big step that weekend.

481
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,230
turned out. it even took a bigger one

482
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,330
She's sound asleep.  oh.

483
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,460
She is so great.

484
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,830
I think so.

485
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,560
So, uh, I was thinking,

486
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,630
My sister is in town until tomorrow.

487
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,330
And, uh, there's a motel just down the turnpike.

488
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,400
-Wow, that was amazing!  -oh, yeah.

489
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,730
What are you doing?

490
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,730
I gonna call Marshall and Lily tell them about this

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
