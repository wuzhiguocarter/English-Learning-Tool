1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:03,506
<i>Kids, there more than one story
of how I met your mother.</i>

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,761
<i>You know the short version, the thing
with your mom's yellow umbrella.</i>

3
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:08,568
<i>But there's a bigger story.</i>

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,145
<i>The story of how I became who I had
to become before I could meet her.</i>

5
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:14,846
<i>And that story begins,
here.</i>

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,122
...dary!

7
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:18,025
Legendary!

8
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:20,505
Dude, I am so excited
that you're single again.

9
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,630
We are going to conquer
New York City.

10
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,870
I already have a girl
from work lined up for you.

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,842
Right boob bigger
than the left boob,

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,719
which some choose
to look at as bra half empty,

13
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:30,337
I choose to look at as bra half full.

14
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:32,630
I don't know.

15
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:34,462
Robin and I broke up
two weeks ago.

16
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,253
I'm... I'm not ready.

17
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:38,373
When will you be ready?

18
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,263
<i>It was a good question.</i>

19
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:43,342
<i>After a big relationship ends,
you need some time to recuperate.</i>

20
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:47,030
<i>Robin took a trip to Argentina,
and I went through my usual routine.</i>

21
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:48,690
<i>I grew my breakup beard.</i>

22
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,102
Ted Mosby, suit up,

23
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:52,323
'cause here's the plan.
There's a Miss Nassau County pageant.

24
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:55,063
We'll pretend to be judges
and, yes, our votes are for sale.

25
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:57,063
I'm not ready.

26
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,451
<i>I repainted the apartment.</i>

27
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:01,651
Finish Line of a women's 10K.

28
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:05,040
Salty girls on an endorphin high
who just want to lie down.

29
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:08,191
- Yeah.
- I'm not ready.

30
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:10,821
<i>And the truth is,
I was doing really good.</i>

31
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:14,822
Female acrobats from Montreal.
Super flexible.

32
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:17,012
We are going to get
Cirque de So-Laid.

33
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,570
What up?

34
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,361
Barney, come on, we've covered this.
I'm not...

35
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:21,400
Hey, guys.

36
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:23,081
I just got in last night.

37
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:27,611
Um, uh, this is Gael.

38
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:28,942
Hola.

39
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:30,953
Okay, I'm ready.

40
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:35,331
How I Met Your Mother 3x01
<i>- Wait For It -</i>

42
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,353
I just can't believe her.

44
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:51,220
We have this totally amicable split,
everything's cool.

46
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,361
And she comes back
from vacation with that guy?

47
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:54,822
You know what she's doing?

48
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,302
She's trying to win the breakup.

49
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:59,202
What do you mean "win thebreakup",
old-timey inventor?

50
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:03,260
What our 21st president,
Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say,

51
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:06,351
is that in every breakup there are
winners and a losers.

52
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,090
It's not a competition.

53
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:11,933
Now, your 80-day balloon race around
the world, that was a competition.

54
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:13,522
That's my wife.

55
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:16,191
Of course it's a competition, Lil.

56
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,521
How else do you explain...
what's his name?

57
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:19,942
Gael.

58
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:23,273
I'm sorry, Gayle?

59
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:25,633
Gael.

60
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:27,823
Kyle?

61
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:30,081
Gael.

62
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,082
Girl?

63
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,140
It's pronounced "guy-el."

64
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:38,922
It means "joyful."

65
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:42,262
That is why I live
my life by bringing joy,

66
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,880
good energy
and happiness to others.

67
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:47,453
Especially those
less fortunate that I.

68
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:50,262
I'm sorry, so it's Gayle?

69
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:52,843
What a jerk.

70
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:57,140
I don't go to your stupid country and
try to seduce women with my sexy accent.

71
00:02:57,228 --> 00:03:00,670
That's a great point,
Persian nightclub owner.

72
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:03,140
Oh, and he's a masseuse.

73
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:04,633
With a massage,

74
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:06,421
everything is connected.

75
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:10,043
I can touch your foot,
cleanse your kidney.

76
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:14,500
I can touch your earlobe,
and slow your heartbeat.

77
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:17,330
One time, I used warm water
to make a guy pee.

78
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,722
Of course, I didn't
make a career out of it.

79
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:21,190
Career?

80
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:22,972
Such an American idea.

81
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:24,653
My career is living.

82
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:26,130
Windsurfing.

83
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,851
Making love.

84
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:30,820
Sometimes at the same time.

85
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:35,050
How? How would one
do that exactly?

86
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:38,010
Seriously, don't giggle.
Tell me.

87
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:41,962
Not possible. You cannot have sex
on a windsurfing board.

88
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,921
- How do you know?
- Glad you asked, Lily.

89
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,970
I have crafted a list
of every vehicle...

90
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:48,751
land-based, aquatic and airborne...

91
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:51,032
in which/on which it's
possible to have sex.

92
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:55,731
And of those 33 vehicles,
I have had sex in/on 31.

93
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,552
Windsurfing board,
not on the list, not possible.

94
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,960
Oh, P.S., in orderto hit 33,

95
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:04,211
all I need is bobsled
and the Apollo 11 space capsule.

96
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:07,300
To get that last one, you'd have
to break into the Smithsonian.

97
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,343
This conversation never happened.

98
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:13,381
All right, you're suited up,
I'm bearded down.

99
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:15,741
- Let's get out there and win this thing.
- Yes!

100
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:18,062
You guys, have fun on 
your double date.

101
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,141
Oh, for the hundredth time,
I'm sorry, there was a lull.

102
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:24,602
And then we fell asleep on the beach
while counting the stars.

103
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:27,091
Do you want to have dinner
with me? Uh, us?

104
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,220
There was no lull.

105
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:32,930
- You just think he's incredibly hot.
- No, I don't!

106
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:34,623
Not incredibly.

107
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,042
It's a little hard to believe
how hot he is.

108
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:40,552
But, I mean, she's not
serious about him.

109
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,752
The girl never marries the hot guy.

110
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:44,182
Well, you did.

111
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,830
I'm one of the lucky few.

112
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:50,243
Lily, Ted is our best friend,
so let's get something straight:

113
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,741
Male Gayle is not hot.

114
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:54,750
He's not our friend.
Don't even look at him.

115
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,452
Just... no eye contact.

116
00:04:57,057 --> 00:05:00,293
<i>So that night, as Lily and Marshall
did their best to hate Gael...</i>

117
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,643
Hey, Robin. Gael.

118
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,082
<i>Robin pulled me aside
to check in.</i>

119
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:07,022
<i>Now, I'm sure
she meant the best,</i>

120
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,963
<i>but she said the worst.</i>

121
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:10,962
I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.

122
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,491
"I just want to make sure
you're okay with this"?

123
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,322
Damn it! I can't believe she's
the one that gets to say that.

124
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,633
She's winning, isn't she?

125
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:20,513
Not for long.
Okay, pep talk.

126
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:21,582
Take a knee.

127
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,783
Ted, tonight we're going to get you
someone way hotter than Robin.

128
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:28,283
Okay, Robin's a ten.

129
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,090
Fine, we'll get you a 12.

130
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,261
Or, you know...
two sixes.

131
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:35,711
Failing that, four threes.

132
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:37,813
And break glass
in case of emergency,

133
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,742
we'll go to Staten Island,
I'll get you 12 ones.

134
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:43,282
Ted, my boy, I am going to
re-teach you how...

135
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,613
- Amy.
- Ted.

136
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:50,033
Barney.

137
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,663
Ted, we are back!

138
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:56,721
Up here.

139
00:05:59,058 --> 00:05:59,930
Up high.

140
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:02,681
Fivin' it up five-style!

141
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:06,950
I'm sorry this is
all so weird.

142
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:08,671
Weird, why would it be weird?

143
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,560
Because you used to date
our best friend or because my wife

144
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:14,252
thinks your new boyfriend
is incredibly hot?

145
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,599
I do not! Shut up!
Oh, my God!

146
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,497
- I just hope Ted's okay.
- Hmm.

147
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,773
I hate to see you so tense.

148
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:27,893
I mean, we had a really
clean break up, you know?

149
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:31,052
We really acted like adults,
so the last thing... oh!

150
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:38,912
Gael, are you a properly
licensed massage therapist?

151
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:39,911
What?

152
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,203
Are you legally certified by some type
of governing entity?

153
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:45,823
I train for three years at
an institute in Buenos Aires.

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,720
I have a card.
I can show you.

155
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,193
Is the card laminated?

156
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:53,170
- What do you mean "laminated"?
- Covered in protective plastic.

157
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,382
- Oh, yes.
- Damn it.

158
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:56,910
He checks out.

159
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,220
Ted. Ted.

160
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:03,973
- Ted. Ted.
- What!?

161
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:08,033
Let's bail, this place is dead.

162
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:10,271
Yeah, you're right.
We're both totally striking out.

163
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,930
Exactly, plus,
we're on a tight schedule.

164
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:15,962
I've got this entire evening
perfectly planned out... spoiler alert:

165
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:20,541
our last stop is an after hours club so
after hours, it's three days from now.

166
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,870
What up.

167
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,813
Are you blind?
I'm making out with a 12.

168
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,193
- I am winning.
- Yeah, but I didn't get to help.

169
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,711
So you're saying
you want me to throw away

170
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:31,513
a super hot girl just because
you didn't help me get her?

171
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,603
Apology accepted.
Let's go.

172
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:36,361
- Who's the suit?
- This is Barney.

173
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:38,472
- Barney, Amy.
- I'm not gonna remember that.

174
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,630
Now, if you'll exse me,
random chick from earlier tonight,

175
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:44,801
as you shall henceforth be known,
Ted and I have a schedule to keep.

176
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:49,143
Well, you can check off 8:54, dress up
like a dork and bother the cool kids.

177
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:50,780
Beat it, nerd.

178
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:54,553
Wow. Wow.
Great stuff, Tommy Lee.

179
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:57,473
See, what you don't understand is
I'm Ted's wingman.

180
00:07:57,836 --> 00:08:01,322
It's a sacred bond, much stronger
than any... They're making out again.

181
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,530
Massage therapist.

182
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:06,701
And you know what, "Gayle"?

183
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,690
Your piece of chicken
looks a little tense to me.

184
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:14,310
Oh, oh, does that
feel good, Mr. Chicken?

185
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:15,861
Well, guess what?

186
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,740
I didn't wash my hands.

187
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,061
Got him.

188
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:22,303
Lily!

189
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:26,792
We carry so much ancient emotion
in our neck and shoulders.

190
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,050
Things we should have
let go of years ago.

191
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:31,570
I forgive you, Mom.

192
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:37,930
Lily, we are Ted's best friends.
Our job is to hate that guy.

193
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:40,080
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was doing.

194
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:42,301
I was just building him up so

195
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:45,541
a few minutes later,
I could totally cut him down.

196
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:50,503
Weren't you wearing a bra?

197
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,222
<i>The night was going great.</i>

198
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,191
<i>Amy was cool and dangerous.</i>

199
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:56,742
<i>She found a friend for Barney.</i>

200
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:59,050
<i>She even paid for drinks...
sort of.</i>

201
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:03,302
They know us here.
You're gonna get us in trouble.

202
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:06,322
Tell me something. Do you ask your
tailor to leave extra room in the crotch

203
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,400
for your huge vagina?

204
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:14,193
You... your vagina...

205
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:17,611
Ted, this chick is crazy.
We're leaving.

206
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:19,710
Good idea.
Let's all go back to my place.

207
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:24,102
Your place? Thanks but no thanks,
1994 Courtney Love.

208
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:26,071
I have a hot tub.

209
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,283
Okay, this is
actually pretty nice.

210
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:34,590
I like your tatts.

211
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:36,922
Thanks, you can play
with them if you want.

212
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,483
They're a hundred percent real.

213
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,963
No, your tatts... toos,
your tattoos.

214
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:45,591
Thanks.

215
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,183
- You should get one.
- Wrong!

216
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,543
Ted has a classic clean-cut-look

217
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:54,402
that never goes out of style
season after season, burn.

218
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:57,563
Yeah? Well, I think he
would look hot with some ink.

219
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,431
- No, he wouldn't.
- Yes, he would.

220
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:00,520
No, he wouldn't.

221
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,322
I'm ready to do anything
you want by the way. Anything.

222
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,031
Right now.

223
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,032
Ted, who are you gonna side
with on this tattoo thing?

224
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:13,520
I think I'd look
way hot with some ink.

225
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,110
- Yeah, you would.
- Yeah.

226
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,160
Oh, my God!
Tyler?

227
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,600
Mommy! Daddy!
She's back!

228
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:25,730
Damn it, they're supposed
to be in the Hamptons. Run!

229
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,323
Sorry. I used to nanny for
those jerks before they fired me.

230
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:34,293
- So unfair.
- Unfair?

231
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,780
I wouldn't let you take care of the
imaginary kids I make up

232
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:38,250
to score with single moms.

233
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,252
That's it, Ted.
We're going home.

234
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:43,731
Ted?

235
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,010
Ted, you okay?

236
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,001
Hello, Ted.

237
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:51,813
Robin and I are about to make fantastic
aquatic sex on this windsurfing board.

238
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:54,610
And I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.

239
00:10:58,595 --> 00:11:03,012
- Okay, how do we this?
- I think your leg goes up, up...

240
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,942
- Okay, how about if I, um...
- No, mine...

241
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:07,020
I'm okay.

242
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,461
In fact, here's how okay I am.

243
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:13,422
- I'm getting a tattoo.
- You're not getting a tattoo,

244
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:14,442
it's not you.

245
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:17,220
Ted, you are heading
down a dark path.

246
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:20,682
That dark path is my driveway.

247
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,551
But you need a plan
and you need a wingman!

248
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:27,112
This is so going in my blog!

249
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,482
Want to have sex?

250
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:34,533
Okay.

251
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:39,301
And underneath,
it should say, "I win."

252
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:42,660
And then it should have
flames coming out the bottom.

253
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:43,561
Fire!

254
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,300
We should start a fire.

255
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:47,293
After this maybe.

256
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:51,130
Oh, man, this is
going to be legend... Wait for it.

257
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:52,870
<i>And that's all I remember.</i>

258
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:55,420
<i>The next morning,
I woke up alone, back home.</i>

259
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,003
Hey, buddy, how
was your night?

260
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:19,990
You know, it was great.

261
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,810
I met this crazy girl,
I almost got a tattoo.

262
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,600
Don't worry.
I didn't, but it was...

263
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,161
It was amazing.

264
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:30,320
I think it's safe to say,
I am winning this breakup.

265
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:33,321
Look.

266
00:12:34,427 --> 00:12:35,651
Oh, my God.

267
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,550
- What?
- Nothing.

268
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,091
This J. Crew catalog.

269
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:41,911
Who brings two Golden
Retrievers in a canoe?

270
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,991
- We got to call Barney.
- Way ahead of you.

271
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:49,992
Hey, guys, what's
the big emergency?

272
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:53,101
Oh, and B the W:
I am never speaking to Ted again.

273
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,390
Really? Never?

274
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,803
Not even if, say,
butterflies flew out of his ass?

275
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,193
What?

276
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:03,452
Ted? Could you grab me
the fondue pot?

277
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:07,923
He has no idea.

278
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,721
- Mm-hmm.
- And up we go.

279
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,281
Thank you.

280
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:17,833
What?

281
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:20,241
- Ted?
- Mm?

282
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:22,390
I came here
this morning because...

283
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:26,903
- I want to apologize.
- Apology accepted, Barney.

284
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:31,143
As you can see, I do just fine on my own.
I don't need a baby-sitter.

285
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:34,540
See, all this time, I thought you needed
a wingman to fly, but the truth is, you...

286
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:38,582
you've got your
own wings now.

287
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:42,221
Since you and Robin split,
you've been gestating.

288
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:45,682
Growing in your cocoon.

289
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:50,251
And last night...
...you burst out of that cocoon

290
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:53,800
like a...
like a majestic, uh...

291
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:57,100
Gosh, what is it that
comes out of a cocoon?

292
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,201
I was always bad at science.

293
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:01,131
He's going to say it!

294
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:02,721
A butterfly?

295
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:07,250
- What?
- Nothing, buddy.

296
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,090
Ow! Why did that hurt so...?

297
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,292
Oh, my God!

298
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:21,673
- I have a tattoo!
- Oh, that's not a tattoo.

299
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,333
That, dear boy,
is a tramp stamp.

300
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,752
A tramp stamp.

301
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:29,232
You know, a ho tag.
Ass antlers.

302
00:14:29,497 --> 00:14:31,710
A Panama City license plate.

303
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:34,092
<i>And suddenly,
it all came back to me.</i>

304
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,382
...dary!

305
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:36,780
Legendary!

306
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:41,592
Man, I am so winning
this breakup.

307
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,641
I just broke up
with my boyfriend Steve.

308
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:46,902
He was totally annoying.

309
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,271
He was, like, "I think you're the one,
I want to marry you."

310
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:50,343
What a wuss.

311
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,620
Do you think
exes can be friends?

312
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:57,550
Yeah, sure. I mean,
we're still friends, right, Steve?

313
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:00,732
Hey, your name is Steve.

314
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:03,200
And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve.

315
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:05,851
What are the odds of that...?

316
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:07,131
Wait.

317
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:11,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

318
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:12,992
Give me this.

319
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:17,610
- Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.
- Maybe you should try club soda.

320
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,710
Damn it, it really hurts. I need,
like, some ointment or something.

321
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,892
Spanish massage oil.

322
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,761
Spanish massage oil?

323
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,971
What happened here last night?

324
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,431
Last night got weird.

325
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,570
Feel the emotions release.

326
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:11,710
Think I just got over
being chunky in the ninth grade.

327
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,871
You're beautiful.

328
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:17,401
I am beautiful.

329
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:22,620
Experience your food.

330
00:16:27,176 --> 00:16:28,502
Try the mango.

331
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,471
Okay, that's enough of the fruit.

332
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:38,442
We're sorry, Ted.
It'll never happen again.

333
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,800
It meant nothing to us.
It just felt really, really, really good.

334
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:45,521
I can't even look
at you two right now.

335
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:51,490
He got a tramp stamp.

336
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,642
All right, first of all,
this isn't one of those,

337
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:06,010
"I came all the way over here
because I want you back" things.

338
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,311
There'll be no startling
confession of love,

339
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:11,211
no sweet indie rock song that
swells up we're about to kiss,

340
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,851
- none of that crap. Got it?
- Okay.

341
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:14,471
Good.
Now, here's the thing.

342
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:18,590
It sucks that you came back from Argentina
with someone as awesome as Gael.

343
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:20,741
And I know I have no
right to be upset at you.

344
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,703
We're broken up,
life goes on, whatever.

345
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,491
But you know what?
We-We never did this.

346
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:27,740
We-We had this polite breakup
with no irrational yelling, and...

347
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:28,881
and that's just wrong!

348
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,720
So, I'm going to yell
irrationally for a little while,

349
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:34,130
and you're just going to have to
stand there and deal with it, okay?

350
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:37,000
- If you feel like you need to do that...
- I think I do!

351
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:40,070
I really think I do!
So now I'm yelling!

352
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,552
- You shaved.
- I did!

353
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,301
- I liked the beard.
- I liked it, too,

354
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:46,773
but it was getting kind of hot!

355
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,102
Maybe in the winter,
I'll grow it back out!

356
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:52,823
Okay, I'm done.

357
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:56,170
I know it was weird
showing up with Gael.

358
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:57,850
I'm sorry.

359
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:02,562
Look, us breaking up,
it was the right thing.

360
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:05,293
But it took some time to
get over you, you know?

361
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:07,073
I-I'm still getting over you.

362
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,482
But you? You were over it the minute
they started the in-flight movie.

363
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:10,402
Over it?!

364
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:14,112
My first three days in Argentina,
I cried my eyes out.

365
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,363
I missed you so much.

366
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:20,803
I wanted to go and prove how
adventurous I am, but the truth is...

367
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,570
it was really lonely.

368
00:18:22,907 --> 00:18:24,952
And that's why Gael happened.

369
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,391
You weren't trying to win the breakup?

370
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:30,332
I was trying to survive it.

371
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,781
See, look, that all sounds good,

372
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,213
and we'll still be friends
and move on, but...

373
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:41,352
did he have to be so hot?

374
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:44,041
- The guy's an Adonis.
- He's not an Adonis.

375
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:48,122
He's the Cadillac of rebound guys.
Marshall has a crush on him!

376
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:49,832
- The guy's perfect.
- He's not perfect.

377
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,883
Oh, come on. He's hot,

378
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:55,022
he wind surfs,
he massages things.

379
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,362
Name one way I'm better
than that guy.

380
00:18:58,218 --> 00:18:59,163
You're bigger.

381
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:01,850
Don't patronize me. If anything,
he may even be a little bit taller.

382
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,610
No. Ted... you're bigger.

383
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:07,003
I win!

384
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:10,861
<i>Kids, I can't remember exactly
what helped me get through</i>

385
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,742
<i>the whole Robin-Gael incident.</i>

386
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:16,003
<i>I'm sure that it was something
profound and meaningful,</i>

387
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:18,731
<i>and not at all macho and petty,</i>

388
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:21,462
<i>but after that,
I was back on my feet.</i>

389
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,212
<i>And what followed was
a new era in my life,</i>

390
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,513
<i>a crazy time
unlike anything that ce before.</i>

391
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,522
<i>It's funny looking back
at those days,</i>

392
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:32,441
<i>knowing now exactly
what I was heading towards.</i>

393
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:35,353
<i>And what was heading
towards me.</i>

394
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:46,122
Go for Barney.

395
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:48,111
Hey, man, it's Marshall.

396
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:50,862
Check your e-mail.
Sent you something.

397
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:53,531
- What is it?
- Just a new Web site.

398
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,970
Slapcountdown.com.

399
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:00,950
What does this mean?

400
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,133
Ma-Marshall?

401
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:12,512
No.

402
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:18,842
No!
