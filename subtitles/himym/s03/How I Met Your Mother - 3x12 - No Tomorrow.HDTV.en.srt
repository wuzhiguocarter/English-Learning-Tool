1
00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:02,879
<i>But by 2008, we'd all had enough.</i>

2
00:00:02,886 --> 00:00:04,691
<i>Well, most of us.</i>

3
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:08,096
Who wants to kiss
The Barney Stone?

4
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:10,339
- Look, it's the Riddler.
- That's not the Riddler.

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,181
That's Gumby.

6
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:13,254
Hey, Gumby, can we tie you
in a knot later?

7
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:16,577
Hey, NBA player sidelined
by a knee injury?

8
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:19,132
All right, laugh all you want,

9
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:22,041
but this is my lucky
St. Patty's Day suit.

10
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:25,220
I have dry-cleaned many
a stain off of this baby.

11
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:26,962
You know why it's lucky?

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,569
'Cause it's green,
the color of go, as in let's.

13
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,047
Uh, Barney, we, uh...

14
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,993
we talked this over, and, uh,

15
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:35,840
we're not doing
St. Patty's Day this year.

16
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:38,391
Come on. Let's...

17
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:40,341
Are you s...

18
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:44,010
Wow. Okay.

19
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:45,801
I think I got to lie down.

20
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:47,070
Can we shoot pool on you?

21
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,353
No! No!

22
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:50,600
Unacceptable!

23
00:00:50,605 --> 00:00:52,523
That's so not Raven!

24
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:54,602
What are you gonna do instead?

25
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:56,041
We just got the keys to
our new apartment,

26
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:58,153
so we're gonna go over there and
hang up that painting,

27
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,103
have board game night.

28
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:00,540
You're welcome to join us
if you want.

29
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:02,492
Board game night?!

30
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,661
Board game night.

31
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:06,483
Come on!

32
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:08,210
Let's drink green beer.

33
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,013
Let's do green Jell-O shots!

34
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:11,760
Where's your St. Patty's Day spirit?!

35
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,142
We're drinking green tea.

36
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:14,890
With caffeine.

37
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:17,221
Sorry, Peter.
We're grown-ups now.

38
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:19,681
We can't fly off to Neverland
with you anymore.

39
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:21,921
All right, fine.

40
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:23,302
You know what?

41
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:25,691
I'll celebrate St. Patty's Day
by myself.

42
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,482
I don't need you people.

43
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,811
You make me physically ill.

44
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:33,182
He did look a little green.

45
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:38,972
Hello?

46
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:41,371
Hey, happy St. Patty's Day!

47
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:43,670
How are you?
Yeah, I haven't talked to you forever.

48
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,382
- Who is it?
- It's Ted's butt.

49
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:48,881
Ah, damn it!

50
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,472
My phone keeps pocket-dialing!

51
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,120
That's, like, the eighth time today.

52
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,212
In fairness, I did call Ted's butt at,
like, 2:00 this afternoon.

53
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,163
It took long enough to call you back.

54
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:01,812
Barney, where are you?

55
00:02:01,816 --> 00:02:04,310
In a cab, heading downtown with our

56
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,493
hot and sexy dates for the evening.

57
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:09,380
Yes, it happens that fast!

58
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:10,993
We're going to that club Low Point,

59
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:12,342
and you're coming with us.

60
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:13,792
Barney, for the last time...

61
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:16,380
All right, I didn't want to tell you
this in front of Marshall

62
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:17,811
and Lily because they're old
and married,

63
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:20,331
and it's too late for them anyway,
but Ted,

64
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:23,540
the world is going to come
to an end tonight.

65
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:26,023
Yes. Think about it.

66
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:29,000
End of the world, Nostradamus.
Notre Dame.

67
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,092
Fighting Irish.

68
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:32,212
Irish.
St. Patrick's Day.

69
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:33,370
This is it, bro.

70
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:35,373
Bro-pocalypse Now.

71
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,782
Bromageddon.

72
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,461
Ted, you are young, you're single.

73
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:42,093
You'll have so much more fun with me.

74
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,512
Do you really want to spend
your last night on

75
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:47,510
Earth playing board games
with Marshall and Lily?

76
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:52,523
My hands smell weird.
Smell this.

77
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,962
Yeah, they do.
That's new.

78
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:57,062
I'll be there in five minutes.

79
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:00,220
Yes! All right!

80
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:02,171
He's in! Ted's a great guy.

81
00:03:02,177 --> 00:03:03,150
Y...

82
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,432
You're gonna love him.

83
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:11,662
<i>So on March 17, 2008,</i>

84
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,170
<i>I went to a big St. Patrick's Day party.</i>

85
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,001
<i>And it's a good thing I did,</i>

86
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:17,592
<i>because, funny story:</i>

87
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:19,673
<i>your mother was there.</i>

88
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,701
How I Met Your Mother 3x12
<i>- No Tomorrow -</i>

89
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:38,661
Hi. Have you met Ted?

90
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,010
Hi. I'm Mary.

92
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,511
Hi. Happy St. Patty's Day.

94
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,001
I haven't met Ted, either.

96
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,381
- I'm Stephanie.
- Hi.

97
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,081
Dude, back off.
I called dibs on Stephanie.

98
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:49,911
Okay. Mary's hot.

99
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,133
Well, then I want Mary.

100
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:53,323
Fine.

101
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:57,332
Oh, I see.
Reverse psychology.

102
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,521
Then I'm sticking with Stephanie,
Dr. Freud.

103
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:01,460
Okay.

104
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:03,392
- Which one do you want more?
- Either one.

105
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:05,241
- I want them both.
- You're an idiot,

106
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:06,902
and it may be a moot point.

107
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:08,451
I mean, it doesn't look like
we're getting in.

108
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,552
Look at this.

109
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,032
You know why there's a line?

110
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,950
It's because I ditched
Marshall and Lily,

111
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:15,120
and now the universe is
punishing us for it,

112
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,302
that's why.

113
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,322
Yeah.

114
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:25,503
What's it gonna cost us to get in, $20?

115
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:26,683
$40?

116
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:28,802
Dude, come on, you're making
the wee folk look bad.

117
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:30,423
Just give him your pot o' gold.

118
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,290
Is it just you two?

119
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:33,800
Don't worry.
We're not gonna blow your ratio.

120
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,770
We happen to have
two very hot girls with us.

121
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:37,933
Mine's the hotter one.

122
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,712
Look, if it was just you two,

123
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:41,881
you could go in right now.

124
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,512
We got nothing
but girls in there.

125
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,731
People are gonna start
thinking it's a lesbian bar.

126
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,432
Would you excuse us for just a minute?

127
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:53,142
Ted, I'm gonna be honest.

128
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:55,663
I was full of it with that
whole Nostradamus thing.

129
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:56,572
No.

130
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:59,103
But I am starting to think
there is some serious

131
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,370
planetary crap going on here tonight.

132
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:04,202
Never in the history of
New York City nightclubs

133
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,461
has there been a shortage of dudes,

134
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:09,703
not even during
the Great Dude Shortage of 1883.

135
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:11,473
We got to ditch these girls.

136
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:13,781
But you dragged them all
the way down here.

137
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,670
I don't see no ring
on this finger.

138
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:17,580
All right, hold on.

139
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:19,470
Uh, excuse me?

140
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:21,753
Are the girls in there
hotter than our dates?

141
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,843
I don't know if they're hotter,

142
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,043
but they're drunker.

143
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:26,450
Rock 'n' roll.

144
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,802
Welcome to your dream home,
my lady.

145
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,709
All right, all right.

146
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:38,157
You can put me down.
Robin thinks we're weird.

147
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,530
No, it's fine.

148
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,680
It was only weird on the subway.

149
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,762
Oh. I'm gonna check
the other rooms to see

150
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:48,591
if the previous owners
left us any free stuff.

151
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,552
I'm gonna hang our
first piece of art.

152
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,280
Oh, look, there's already a nail.

153
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,803
Hey, Lil, free nail!

154
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,240
Score!

155
00:05:58,706 --> 00:05:59,982
How's that?
Perfect.

156
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,053
Oh, now this is ridiculous.

157
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,212
Is it the nail?

158
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:15,120
Marshall?

159
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,922
Is the wall slippery or something?

160
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:17,641
Marshall.

161
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,671
Is there a wind?
Is there some sort of draft in here?

162
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:20,911
- Marshall!
- What?

163
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,232
Your apartment's crooked.

164
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:24,873
What do you mean?

165
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,350
<i>It was the kind of thing
you didn't notice until you noticed it.</i>

166
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,441
<i>But once you did notice it,
you couldn't not notice it.</i>

167
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:38,580
<i>Lily and Marshall's
new apartment was crooked.</i>

168
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:42,420
Oh, no!

169
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:44,211
Oh, no, no, no!

170
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:46,351
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

171
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:47,050
Yes.

172
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:50,362
Are you telling me that we just spent our
entire life savings and then some on...

173
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:51,853
on a crooked apartment?

174
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:53,433
Oh, my God!

175
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,570
No, she's gonna flip.

176
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:55,592
Just calm down.
It's gonna be fine.

177
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:57,602
Look what I found in the kids' room!

178
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:59,692
Free skateboard.
Score!

179
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,551
Free Hungry Hungry Hippos.

180
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,143
Double score!
I'm gonna check the kitchen!

181
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:06,091
Okay.
How could she not notice this?

182
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:08,541
It's like the last 20 minutes
of Titanic in here.

183
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,690
We have to keep this quiet.

184
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,312
If Lily finds out her new dream
house is crooked, it's gonna...

185
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,643
it's gonna break her heart.

186
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:16,870
Free salad strainer!

187
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,642
I love this place.

188
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,942
Just for tonight, okay?

189
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,071
Okay.

190
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,900
But it's gonna be an uphill battle.

191
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:29,411
I am just saying we have to
think of the right angle.

192
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,862
I have a third one,
but I'm not gonna say it.

193
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:37,050
Okay, Barney, I think we've stumbled
into some kind of ethical,

194
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,413
philosophical wormhole.

195
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:39,603
- Green suit.
- Yeah.

196
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,302
I ditched Marshall and Lily,

197
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:43,542
and was rewarded with
two beautiful girls.

198
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,712
Suit's made of green.

199
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:47,040
We bailed on those
two beautiful girls,

200
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:50,031
and now we're being rewarded
with a sea of beautiful girls.

201
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,601
38 long.

202
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:54,990
It's like the laws of the universe
are working in reverse.

203
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,131
- Can you put it on my tab?
- Yeah. What's the last name?

204
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:57,951
Garrido.

205
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:01,721
All right, I'm gonna try something,
and if this works...

206
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:02,532
Uh, hey.

207
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:03,710
Hey, what can I get you guys?

208
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,832
A bottle of Dom Perignon,
and can you put it on my tab?

209
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:06,990
Sure. What's the name?

210
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:08,562
- Garrido.
- Dude!

211
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:11,250
Oh, uh, yeah, you're right.
Uh, make it two bottles.

212
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,142
Two.

213
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:14,762
Now we wait,
see if something good happens...

214
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,051
Oh! Hello!

215
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,243
St. Patrick's Day tradition.

216
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,541
If you're not wearing green,
you got to get pinched.

217
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:21,312
Well, I guess I got what I deserved.

218
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,631
I'm not wearing green, either.

219
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:26,010
This is, um, deep teal.

220
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:28,722
- The lighting makes it...
- Uh, I'm Ted.

221
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,263
Ashlee with two "e"s.

222
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:33,531
Please. "C"s at most.

223
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,561
You know, you guys should
come join me and my friends.

224
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:39,782
We have a bottle of tequila and
shockingly deep belly buttons.

225
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,993
Okay, it's official:
do bad things, good things happen.

226
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:46,910
Ted, listen.

227
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,160
Are you hearing that?
That's the universe.

228
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,180
The universe is talking to us.

229
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:53,252
We don't have to build
a baseball field, do we?

230
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:58,272
No. The universe is telling us that
we have a free pass tonight.

231
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:02,911
The universe is saying that
we don't have to live in fear of the...

232
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,432
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

233
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:07,222
...of the repercussions of our actions.

234
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,680
There is no waiting for tomorrow,

235
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:11,412
because do you know why, Ted?

236
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,661
There is no tomorrow.

237
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,193
No tomorrow, huh?

238
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,703
By the way, Mr. Garrido,

239
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:24,493
second bottle of champagne gets you
a complimentary ounce of caviar.

240
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:25,512
Enjoy.

241
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,441
- No tomorrow!
- No tomorrow!

242
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,931
No tomorrow!

243
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,452
Hey, I wonder what
the grown-ups are doing right now.

244
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:42,501
I win again.

245
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,362
Why do I keep winning?

246
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:48,033
Maybe your hippo is just
hungrier hungrier than ours.

247
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:48,761
That's it.

248
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,391
That's what it is.
It's not gravity,

249
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:51,720
that's for sure.
I'll tell you that.

250
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:55,341
What was that?

251
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,832
What's going on here?

252
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,513
Okay, Lily...

253
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:09,370
while you were in
the other room, Robin and I,

254
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,152
we discovered something
about the apartment.

255
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,262
It's not a big deal.

256
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,821
It's not like a disaster.
It's just...

257
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:18,211
It's something that we're going
to have to learn to live with.

258
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:24,442
Robin and I saw a ghost.

259
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,041
What?

260
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,151
Oh, he's kidding, right?

261
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,882
No, we really saw a ghost.

262
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,571
What did it look like?

263
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:36,300
Uh, a sheet with two holes in it.

264
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:39,302
He was a Confederate general

265
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,680
who was wounded at
the Battle of Antietam,

266
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:46,261
and he died at the army hospital
which once stood on this very spot.

267
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,372
And now he wanders these halls,

268
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:52,111
vowing revenge against the
Union cannonade hat once felled him.

269
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,573
But he seems nice.
He's a good-good guy.

270
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,372
Marshall, you see ghosts everywhere.
You see ghosts at Stars Bucks.

271
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:03,452
That Kenny G holiday CD
just flew off the shelf.

272
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:04,853
Last time that happened.

273
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,512
But, Robin, you're a skeptic,

274
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,891
so if you say you saw a ghost...

275
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:14,042
It passed right through me,

276
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:17,632
and suddenly I felt cold,
so very cold.

277
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:23,403
You know, Ashlee, I'm sorry.

278
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:25,471
You're probably just gonna want
to get up and walk away,

279
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,492
but I just have to test out
this theory I've been working on.

280
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:31,961
Tonight, I am not looking
for a relationship.

281
00:11:31,965 --> 00:11:34,313
I really just want to hook up with you,

282
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,541
leave before breakfast,
and never see you again.

283
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:39,982
I'm in.

284
00:11:39,988 --> 00:11:41,881
Unbelievable.

285
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:45,963
Hot damn, that's a deep navel.

286
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:47,652
No tomorrow, Ted.

287
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,563
Yeah, no tomorrow, Barney.

288
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:51,793
No tomorrow, huh?

289
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,110
I like that idea.

290
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,020
Because if there is a tomorrow,

291
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,142
I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.

292
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:01,402
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

293
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:03,123
I'm married.

294
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,712
Tell me you're messing with me, guys.

295
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:09,681
You didn't actually see a ghost.

296
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:12,322
It's not a big deal, baby.
He seemed friendly.

297
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:15,640
You said he's a Confederate general.
They're the bad guys.

298
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,312
And he's probably racist.

299
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:19,553
No, he seemed polite.

300
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:22,171
He had courtly Southern manners.

301
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,192
We're gonna raise our kids here.

302
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,172
I don't want some Confederate general
ghost teaching them his racism.

303
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:31,641
He loves people of
all colors and creeds.

304
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,592
He was fighting
for states' rights, that's all.

305
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:35,331
Robin said he was wearing a sheet.

306
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:37,071
What do you think that means?

307
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:38,932
The apartment is crooked.

308
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:40,981
What?

309
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,642
Robin and I didn't see a ghost.

310
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:50,842
The floor is crooked, isn't it?

311
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:52,602
Yeah.

312
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:57,310
We spent our entire life's
savings on this floor.

313
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:02,142
The next 30 mortgage-paying years
of our lives will be spent

314
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,713
on this floor, and it's crooked.

315
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,353
Thanks a lot, Robin.

316
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:19,323
How is "racist ghost"
better than "crooked"?

317
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,711
Seriously, somebody tell me
how that's better.

318
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:26,533
Oh, I'm sorry.

319
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:28,050
Oh, that's okay.

320
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,993
Um, dude, so, I'm having second
thoughts about that theory.

321
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:34,630
I'm telling you, if you want to know how
old a woman is, check her elbows.

322
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,830
Not that theory.

323
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:38,902
You have to be more specific, Ted,
'cause I have so many theories.

324
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,771
The whole do bad,
good things happen...

325
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:44,301
- Ashlee is married.
- So?

326
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:45,750
What do you mean, so?

327
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:47,671
Open your brain tank, brah,

328
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:51,310
'cause here comes some
premium 91 octane knowledge.

329
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,981
There's three rules of cheating:

330
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:55,371
It's not cheating if you're not
the one who's married,

331
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,751
it's not cheating if her name has
two adjacent vowels,

332
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,271
and it's not cheating if she's from
a different area code.

333
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:02,712
You're fine on all three counts.

334
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:04,740
How do you know she's from
a different area code?

335
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:06,853
She's 516.

336
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,982
She might dress like she's 718,
act like she's 212,

337
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,132
but trust me, she's 516.

338
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,472
Oh, and her husband...

339
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,713
letting her out alone
on Saint Patty's Day?

340
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:18,972
If that dude's not 973, I'm 307.

341
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:21,773
Wyoming.

342
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:28,240
We're gonna have to nail down
all our furniture.

343
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:30,650
We won't be able to get
a pinball machine.

344
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:34,093
I mean, unless we put some books under
two of the legs or something.

345
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:35,820
But then what if we want
to read those books?

346
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:37,573
This is a nightmare.

347
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:41,011
We can't raise our kids here.
They'll grow up slanted.

348
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:43,893
If we have a daughter,
we'll have to call her Eileen.

349
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:47,673
I don't think we can live here,
Marshall.

350
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,223
I don't know what we're gonna do.

351
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:52,110
Marshall?

352
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:54,131
Open the door.

353
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:07,362
If I make it through the door,
that's five points.

354
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,391
Woo-hoo!

355
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,661
Yeah!

356
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:15,100
<i>Five points.</i>

357
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:17,503
Ten bucks says I can do it backwards.

358
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:21,441
<i>So Lily and Marshall decided to make
the best of a bad situation.</i>

359
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:25,222
<i>And that's also how the sport of
Apartment Roller Luge was invented.</i>

360
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:28,841
Very careful baby!
Oh yeah!

361
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,601
So she's married?
It's not like she has kids.

362
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:32,823
How do you know?

363
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:33,963
Wrists.

364
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,241
It's like you don't even listen to me.

364
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:39,241
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

365
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:40,461
Where'd you go?

366
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:41,773
Well, I just, um...

367
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,420
- Was it something I said?
- No, no, no, it's just, well...

368
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:48,563
you're married and-and we've been
drinking, and I was worried we might...

369
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,281
Oh, this is a very bad idea.

370
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:56,752
- We have a problem.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

371
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,511
Hey.

372
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:00,182
Is this your husband?

373
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:02,461
I've never seen this man in my life.

374
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:04,911
Oh, okay.
Uh, what's our problem?

375
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:06,993
Rick. Rick Garrido.

376
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:08,831
According to the bartender,
I'm the guy

377
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:11,003
that's been buying you
champagne all night.

378
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:14,980
Okay, there's-there's
a very simple explana...

379
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:18,070
Next thing I know the police show up,
they arrest the other guy,

380
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,501
and I'm drinking for free
the rest of the night.

381
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:22,771
It was awesome.

382
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,072
Awesome, huh?

383
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,260
Yeah.

384
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,901
You don't see anything wrong
with that story?

385
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,570
Well, I lost my new phone back
at the club somewhere.

386
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:33,902
What the hell is wrong
with you, dude?

387
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,933
You know me, I lose things.

388
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:38,673
You kissed a married woman, Ted.

389
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:41,223
You committed credit card fraud.

390
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:45,022
You... you kissed a married woman.
Do you know how offensive that is to me?

391
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:46,640
You're turning into Barney.

392
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:48,382
We don't need another Barney.

393
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,831
Look...

394
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:51,953
it's Saint Patty's Day.

395
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:54,492
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.

396
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,563
- "It wasn't as bad as it sounds"?
- No.

397
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:57,763
Huh? Okay...

398
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,662
I want you to hear exactly
how it sounds, Ted.

399
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,433
<i>First skipped message:
I don't see no ring on this finger.</i>

400
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:07,641
<i>And then last night started
coming back to me:</i>

401
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:08,932
<i>The real version.</i>

402
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:12,402
<i>Are the girls in there
hotter than our dates ?</i>

403
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,372
<i>I don't know if they're hotter,
but they're drunker.</i>

404
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,830
<i>Rock 'n' roll.</i>

405
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:23,712
- How many messages did I...
- Seventeen...

406
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:28,552
<i>Kids, it's sometimes possible to think
you're doing just fine in life...</i>

407
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:31,472
<i>Next message:
Can you put it on my tab?</i>

408
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:33,872
<i>Sure, what's the last name?</i>

409
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,472
<i>Garrido.</i>

410
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:37,872
<i>...and then someone opens
your eyes a little bit,</i>

411
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:39,131
<i>and you realize...</i>

412
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,512
<i>Next message:</i>

413
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,332
<i>I really want to hook up with you,</i>

414
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,973
<i>leave before breakfast,
and then never see you again.</i>

415
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,460
<i>...your whole world is off balance...</i>

416
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:49,400
<i>Next message :</i>

417
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:50,461
<i>...out of whack...</i>

418
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,613
<i>Okay, look, brah,</i>

419
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,163
<i>there is a very simple explana...</i>

420
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,041
<i>...crooked.</i>

421
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:03,063
That was hard to listen to.

422
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:07,510
No one likes how they sound
on an answering machine.

423
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,053
Thanks for doing that.

424
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:15,942
You yelled at me.

425
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:18,102
You got very firm with me.

426
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:19,213
Very confident.

427
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:20,730
It was cool.

428
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:22,272
Thanks.

429
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,512
- You're very sexy when you yell, Marshall.
- Shut up.

430
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:27,231
Veins, crazy muscles in your neck.

431
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,292
You look like
a Kentucky Derby-winning steed.

432
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:30,613
You're ruining a nice moment.

433
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:32,833
At one point, I swear,
I thought we were gonna kiss.

434
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,543
Ted, seriously.

435
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:36,402
I'm married.

436
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:41,273
Oh... a slanted floor.

437
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,542
Architecturally speaking,
fixing that's going to be...

438
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:46,270
Very, very, very expensive.

439
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:49,083
And it's gonna take some time, too, so

440
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,163
it looks like you're stuck with us for
a little while longer, if that's okay.

441
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:53,450
Are you kidding?

442
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:54,382
I love it.

443
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:57,150
I don't know what's gonna happen
to me without you guys around.

444
00:18:57,155 --> 00:18:58,010
Where are you going?

445
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:00,562
I'm going to get my stupid phone.

446
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:04,733
<i>So that was Saint Patrick's Day, 2008.</i>

447
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:07,772
<i>I found out years later
that your mom was at that party.</i>

448
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,342
<i>I just didn't meet her.</i>

449
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:11,433
<i>And it's a good thing I didn't,</i>

450
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:14,363
<i>'cause if I had met her,
I don't think she would have liked me.</i>

451
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:16,480
<i>Heck, I don't think I liked me.</i>

452
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,023
<i>But that's okay.</i>

453
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:19,423
<i>Tomorrow had arrived.</i>

454
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:22,730
# Leave me alone, and there'll be #

455
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:28,681
# No one to get hurt #

456
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:37,503
# Nobody move and there'll be
Nothin' to disturb #

457
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:47,252
# The sum of it all is that you
Don't know where to turn #

458
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:55,353
# Despite all your promises you
Don't keep what you learn #

459
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,472
<i>You see, I didn't know it yet,</i>

460
00:19:57,968 --> 00:20:00,893
<i>but my luck was about to change.</i>

461
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:06,302
# Beautiful beat get me
out of this mess #

462
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm awesome!
