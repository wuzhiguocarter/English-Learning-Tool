1
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:05,382
<i>Kids, sometimes in life you see someone
and you just instantly know</i>

2
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,107
<i>this is the person for you.</i>

3
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:09,456
<i>It can happen anywhere.</i>

4
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:12,524
<i>Even the waiting room
of a tattoo removal clinic.</i>

5
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,873
<i>And that's what happened
when I met...</i>

6
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:16,625
<i>...Stella.</i>

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,601
Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp.

8
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:24,841
My bread and butter.

9
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:28,423
So I'm guessing that the real story
involves a bad breakup and some booze.

10
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,200
Unless it's a gang tattoo,
in which case,

11
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:32,222
I think it's time to find a new gang.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,119
No, I just thought it would be cool
to get a caterpillar tattoo,

13
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:37,257
and then a few weeks went by,
and all of a sudden...

14
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,060
Well, I can get rid
of it in ten one-hour sessions,

15
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,480
but, I should warn you,
laser surgery's very painful.

16
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:46,713
Well, I think you'll find I have
a very high tolerance for pain.

17
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:49,152
Just last night, I sat through
the worst movie ever made.

18
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:52,882
- Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?
- No, the worst movie...

19
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:54,741
Manos: Hands of Fate.

20
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,733
Uh, I'm a doctor, went to
medical school. It's Plan 9.

21
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:59,780
If you don't believe me, it's playing
down at the Pamela Theater.

22
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,540
I don't believe you, Doctor.

23
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,081
Well, what are you doing tonight?

24
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:08,872
Hello.

25
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:10,563
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey.

26
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,432
Hey, put that away.
Tonight's on me.

27
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:14,892
- Oh, no, no, don't...
- Come on, I insist.

28
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:16,601
That's so nice. Thank you.

29
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,273
Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted.
He wants to pay.

30
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:23,110
- Thank you.
- One, two, three, four.

31
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:29,130
Is something wrong?

32
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,110
No, it's just, um...

33
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,120
I'm just a little embarrassed.
I thought this was a date.

34
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:38,050
But it's no big deal.
Don't worry about it.

35
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,182
What's wrong?

36
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:43,501
Ted's embarrassed,
he thought this was a date.

37
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,561
Ted thought this was a date.

38
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:48,273
Stella, did you know
Ted thought this was a date?

39
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,270
What? I'm not allowed to date
a patient. It's an AMA rule.

40
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,772
She's not allowed to date patients.
It's an AMA rule.

41
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,441
She's not allowed to date patients.
It's an AMA rule.

42
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:58,572
- She's not allowed to date...
- Yeah, I got it.

43
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:00,752
We all got it.
Ted's a schmuck.

44
00:02:04,097 --> 00:02:07,771
How I Met Your Mother 3x13
<i>- Ten Sessions -</i>

45
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,800
And you bought all the tickets.

46
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,970
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you were right.

47
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:25,932
Worst movie-going experience ever.

48
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:28,193
Of course, it had nothing to do
with the movie.

49
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:30,342
I am so sorry that
you thought that was a date.

50
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:33,592
No, it's fine. I got to hang out
with you on girls' night out.

52
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:36,791
All right, so if you're not allowed
to date a patient, I'll just...

54
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:40,140
I'll wait until these ten session are up
and then I'll ask you out then.

56
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:42,183
Well, then, fair warning:

57
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:43,852
I'm going to say no.

58
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:46,883
Really? I'm getting
mixed signals from you.

59
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:49,111
I feel like you've been staring
at my ass for quite some time.

60
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,121
- What, you're married?
- No.

61
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:53,062
- Boyfriend?
- No.

62
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:54,193
- Lesbian?
- No.

63
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:55,912
- Only date black guys?
- No.

64
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,582
And yet you can say
with absolute confidence

65
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:03,333
that ten weeks from now, if I ask you
out on a date, your answer will be...

66
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,412
No.

67
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,001
No... Hmm.

68
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,380
What could she mean
when she says no?

69
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:14,461
I don't know, it is totally cryptic.

70
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,333
This is far from over.

71
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,012
We're talking ten weeks from now.

72
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,432
Who knows what she'll want then?

73
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:21,682
Do you know what you're going to
want for lunch ten weeks from now?

74
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,060
Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail
and a milk shake.

75
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,803
Ted, do you know how long
it takes a woman

76
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,681
to decide whether or not
she's going to sleep with a guy?

77
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,233
8.3 seconds.

78
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:33,482
After that, her decision is made.
She will not change her mind.

79
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,493
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

80
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:38,032
Describe your first 8.3 seconds
with Stella.

81
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:41,920
Lower back butterfly tattoo,
you're up.

82
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,501
So we got off to a rocky start.

83
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:50,380
That may be a problem
for some guys,

84
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:52,323
but I get better over time.

85
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,210
I'm not some Top 40 song...

86
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:55,840
easily digestible.

87
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,803
I'm complex. I require...

88
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,801
time and multiple listens.

89
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:01,853
I'm "Stairway to Heaven."

90
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:05,851
Wow, Roger Daltrey just
rolled over in his grave.

91
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:09,983
That's not the right guy, is it?

92
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,071
He's not even dead, is he?

93
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:15,320
I think that's great, Ted.

94
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,270
You can do whatever
you set your mind to.

95
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:19,631
In fact, you've inspired me.

96
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,781
I'm going to stop biting my nails.

97
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:25,413
- But, baby, you love biting your nails.
- I know, but I'm doing this for Ted.

98
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,992
God, this is really hard.

99
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,452
Give me ten sessions,

100
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:34,081
I'm going to turn that "no"
into a "yes."

101
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,171
Really, Ted?
You think so?

102
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:38,882
Well, tell me, how did the rest
of that session go?

103
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,101
This is going to hurt a little.

104
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:43,202
Yeah, well, I can handle pain.

105
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,833
This one time
I was playing tennis, and...

106
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:53,701
Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts.

107
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,483
Everyone probably sounds like that.

108
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,481
Doctor, are you all right?
I heard a woman screaming in here.

109
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:09,911
Here's to nine more great sessions.

110
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,792
<i>And so the weeks went by.</i>

111
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,791
<i>The second session
I told her about</i>

112
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,481
<i>how I spent a summer working
with inner-city kids.</i>

113
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:24,731
<i>The third session we both spoke
nothing but French.</i>

114
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:29,313
<i>The fourth session I made her laugh
so hard she fell out of her chair.</i>

115
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,852
<i>So by the time the fifth session
came around...</i>

116
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:34,893
Still no.

117
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:37,772
Still no.

118
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,363
What's up with that?
I mean, I juggled.

119
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,071
You juggled?

120
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,201
I thought you were trying
to impress her.

121
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,472
You do magic.

122
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:47,282
How is juggling any lamer than magic?

123
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:48,790
Magic's not lame.

124
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:51,131
- I don't get it. I mean...
- Is this lame?

124
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:54,131
- Uhh..
- Barney, no, no..

125
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,540
We said no fireballs at the table.

126
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:58,133
What the hell is wrong with you?

127
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,502
There's alcohol in here.

128
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:00,462
- Barney...
- I...

129
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:01,821
We've talked about this.

130
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:05,013
- It's a fire code violation.
- Yeah, but Ted provoked me.

131
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:07,301
No, you are on a time-out.
Go sit over there.

132
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,422
- But...
- Go!

133
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,793
Anyway... I don't get it.

134
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,102
She should be into me by now.

135
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,731
You know, you can do this, Ted.

136
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:20,390
I said that I would stop biting
my nails, and kablam-ey.

137
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,281
It's just a challenge.

138
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:23,942
It can't be easy
to woo someone while

139
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:26,161
you're sticking
your naked butt in their face.

140
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:27,872
Works for baboons.

141
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,791
It's called "presenting."

142
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,092
I got four sessions left.

143
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:36,170
There's got to be an angle
I'm not seeing.

144
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:39,582
You can't turn a "no" into a "yes," Ted.
Can't be done.

145
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,809
I don't know, Barney. I mean,
sometimes persistence pays off.

146
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:44,927
- I said "yes" eventually.
- No, you didn't.

147
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,881
You were like, "No, we can't,

148
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,720
we're friends.
It would mess up the dynamic

149
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,992
- of the group."
- To Ted.

150
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,063
Oh, right.

151
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,641
Wait a second.
Wait a second, I got the angle.

152
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:55,652
Sir, please don't yell at me,

153
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:58,941
because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency to start crying.

154
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:01,021
Please don't do it.

155
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:02,993
Abby, I've told you before.

156
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:04,980
When they're rude to you,
hang up the phone.

157
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,493
Go on, you can do this, hang up.

158
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:09,992
Abby, hang it up.

159
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:13,121
<i>I am too busy to waste my time...</i>

160
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm sorry, I just wish that some of
the patients would be nicer to you.

161
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,462
The receptionist.
That's my way in.

162
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,551
I like this.

163
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:25,631
Seduce the receptionist.
That's a great plan.

164
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,160
That's not the plan.

165
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,430
And how would that
help me with Stella?

166
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:30,242
Who?

167
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,140
Here's the plan.

168
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,562
Hi. Here.

169
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:37,641
I stopped...

170
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,022
Hi, I stopped for coffee and I...

171
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,253
and I thought I'd grab you something.

172
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:47,511
Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice.

173
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:48,511
You're like a knight.

174
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,411
I should call you Sir Ted.

175
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,082
What?

176
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,133
Nothing. Nothing.
It's really stupid.

177
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,581
Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.

178
00:07:58,528 --> 00:07:59,680
Thanks. Thanks, Abby.

179
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:04,632
And now we wait.

180
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,000
<i>And sure enough, by session seven,</i>

181
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,852
<i>she saw me in a whole new light.</i>

182
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,511
Okay, I'm about to break
my big rule here.

183
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:12,771
Break it.

184
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,203
Abby goes bowling
with her church group

185
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:18,660
every Wednesday night...

186
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,062
and she really wanted to invite you,
but she's too shy.

187
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:24,443
Abby is...?

188
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:27,633
My receptionist.

189
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,920
You really made quite an impression
on her with the coffee the other day.

190
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:32,530
I mean, she has really not stopped
talking about you.

191
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:34,461
Oh, Abby.

192
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,850
I thought you said "Alan."

193
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:40,040
But you just said, "Abby is...?"

194
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:41,200
Right.

195
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,920
Right, I thought I said "Alan."

196
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,380
Who's Alan?

197
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,333
Who's Abby?

198
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,120
My receptionist.

199
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,082
Exactly.

200
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:57,100
What is happening?

201
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,853
You just got to be yourself,
no more gimmicks.

202
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:03,292
You're right,
no more gimmicks.

203
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:04,153
One more gimmick.

204
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:05,823
<i>You know what's on her shelf?</i>

205
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:08,283
<i>That self-help book The Power of Me.</i>

206
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,501
I know, I know,
but I thought if I read it,

207
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:13,160
maybe we'd have something new
to talk about.

208
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,542
It's actually a great book. It taught me
the power of complete memory.

209
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:19,870
Can I borrow your copy?

210
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,331
I left it somewhere.
I forget.

211
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,883
Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

212
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:30,092
Hi, Ted.

213
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,490
I'll let her know.

214
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,852
Telepathically?

215
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:40,102
That's funny.
That's funny, smart, and great.

216
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:44,523
I am so sorry that I am late.

217
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,251
I have, like, two minutes for lunch
everyday. It's crazy.

218
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:49,942
Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh,
checking out the old bookshelf here.

219
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:53,081
I see you've read The Power of Me.
It's funny...

220
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:55,351
What? Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no,

221
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,682
I would never read that piece of crap.

222
00:09:57,785 --> 00:09:59,232
Some patient left it here.

223
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:02,192
Oh, thank God.
I couldn't agree more.

224
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:03,612
That's total crap.

225
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,581
I see people reading that on the subway
and I just want to shout,

226
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,830
"Get a life, people!"

227
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:09,671
- Ted, I found your book.
- What?

228
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,423
Your book The Power of Me. I think you
accidentally dropped it in the garbage.

229
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,212
What? No, that's...
that's not mine.

230
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:15,802
I've never seen that before in my life.

231
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:17,341
No, you were reading it in the lobby.

232
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,601
What, no, you have me confused
with someone else.

233
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:22,181
No, no, look right here.
"From the personal library of Ted Mosby"

234
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:23,731
That's you.

235
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,232
Ted,

236
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:28,853
I hate to say this,

237
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:31,443
but I think it's
"nail the receptionist" time.

238
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:32,990
I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.

239
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:36,763
Ted, every little boy wants to grow up
to nail the doctor or the lawyer.

240
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,333
Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.

241
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,161
No. I like Stella.

242
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:43,100
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Ted.

243
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,713
Your little Stella is not so perfect.

244
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,231
What do you mean?

245
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:50,613
I went down there
and checked her out for myself.

246
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,202
And while I was down there,

247
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,470
I discovered that she had a secret,

248
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:00,432
a terrible... terrible secret.

249
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:02,771
What? What is it?

250
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,423
Hold on, I gotta pee.

251
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,070
Okay, I'm back.

252
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:15,863
What's going on at work?

253
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:17,281
What's the big secret?!

254
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:18,571
Oh. Oh, right.

255
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,531
Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.

256
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:21,663
Sure, what's it regarding?

257
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, I just want to see her. Want to
look at her, see what she looks like.

258
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,080
I-I don't understand.

259
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,543
I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima
numero dos when I called?

260
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:32,461
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

261
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,590
I want to see her!

262
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:36,343
Sir, please don't yell at me

263
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:39,432
because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency to start crying.

264
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:42,473
Please don't do that. Please.

265
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:47,503
<i>At first she seemed great, beautiful,
smart, way out of your league.</i>

266
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:49,922
<i>But then, I overheard this conversation.</i>

267
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:55,192
Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist
call yet?

268
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:58,493
When am I going to kick
this folliculaphilia?

269
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,120
Folliculaphilia?

270
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:08,371
Folliculaphilia.

271
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:09,790
What is that?

272
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:12,630
Ted, your perfect woman...

273
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:14,153
can only be attracted...

274
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,820
to men with moustaches.

275
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:22,553
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard. That's not real.

276
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,310
You're right, Ted.
I'm just making that up.

277
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,642
I know that you are
because there's no such thing.

278
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:31,232
I got it a little bit.

279
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:39,360
Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

280
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,892
Oh, hi, Ted.
Love the 'stache.

281
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:44,993
You look like a youngTom Selleck,
only a million times handsomer.

282
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,400
Dr. Zinman,
Magnum's here to see you.

283
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,781
Just kidding. Stupid.

284
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:56,981
Sorry I'm late.
Typical two-minute lunch.

285
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:00,090
So we are very close to getting...

286
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,893
Why? Just why?

287
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,352
Y-you don't remember?

288
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:15,271
I'll bet anyone ten bucks
I can get Ted to grow a moustache.

289
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,361
Uh... okay.

290
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:22,782
You sabotaged my next to last chance
with Stella for ten dollars?

291
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:25,612
I know.
I would've done it for free.

292
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,332
But, no. You owe me ten bucks.

293
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:32,681
This is awful. My-my tenth session
is next week.

294
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,450
I'm gonna ask her out and,

295
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:38,130
she's gonna say the most demoralizing
syllable in the English language, no.

296
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,222
You know what? Just forget it.
I'm not even gonna ask her.

297
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:44,372
No, you have to. She likes you.
She said so herself.

298
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,001
I mean...

299
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,183
Oh, my God,
you went and saw her, too.

300
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:50,312
I swear to you, I did not.

301
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,520
My wife's always getting on me
about my dry elbows.

302
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:00,343
So good to be in a relationship.

303
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,700
Anyone special in your life?

304
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,762
Or maybe just someone
you're interested in?

305
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:06,322
Interes-ted in?

306
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,922
You know, we should really
get this mole checked out.

307
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,551
It's just a little irregular.

308
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,031
<i>Irregular?</i>

309
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:15,703
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

310
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:18,383
<i>This is it. It's all over.</i>

311
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,620
One patients has this little butterfly
tattoo at the bottom of his back.

312
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:23,053
Can you stop talking
about your other patients?!

313
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,001
I'm dying here, woman!

314
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:30,130
Look, even if it is something,
it's easily treatable, so try to relax.

315
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:31,270
Okay.

316
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:34,481
Hey, what was it you were saying before
about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?

317
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,442
Oh, that... that's nothing.
It's just a little crush.

318
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,622
So I will be calling you
with your results.

319
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:43,380
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

320
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,851
Oh, sir, your book!

321
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:50,451
- No.
- Yes.

322
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:52,472
She said "crush"?

323
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:55,322
And she was talking about me?

324
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,910
<i>That last session was
the least painful of all.</i>

325
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:01,833
<i>I savored every searing blast
of that laser.</i>

326
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,113
All done.

327
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,553
<i>The moment I'd waited
ten weeks for had arrived.</i>

328
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:08,303
Stella...

329
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:12,360
...now that I'm no longer your patient,

330
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:15,831
would you like
to have dinner with me?

331
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:22,480
- Ted, you're a really nice guy...
- Oh, no.

332
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:25,070
It has been so great
getting to know you.

333
00:15:25,276 --> 00:15:26,651
I am gonna kill Marshall.

334
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,323
I've had so much fun
these last ten weeks.

335
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:31,120
Oh, my God, this is worse
than the laser.

336
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:32,993
I have a daughter.

337
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:35,322
What?

338
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,710
Her name's Lucy.
She's eight.

339
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:41,173
Work and being with her,
that's pretty much my life.

340
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:42,803
My social calendar

341
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:45,523
is movie night with the girls
once a month when I can get a sitter.

342
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,200
I mean, I've been to one
party in the past year...

343
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:50,711
St. Paddy's Day...
it was awful, I left early.

344
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,323
But, really, my only free time is
the two minutes I get for lunch, so...

345
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:55,930
this is why I don't date.

346
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:02,861
I only have time for one most important
person in my life, and that's Lucy.

347
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,161
Anyway, it's been fun.

348
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,513
Next time, think before you ink.

349
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:10,263
But if you ever do
wake up with, like, a

350
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:14,531
dolphin tattoo on your ankle,
just give me a call.

351
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,381
There it is.. she's a mom.

352
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:23,673
It's just not gonna happen.

353
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:25,163
Sorry, dude.

354
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,450
Have a shrimp.

355
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:28,380
I'm good.

356
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,501
I guess I got
no one but myself to blame.

357
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:34,942
She told me right from the start she was
gonna say no and sure enough...

358
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,000
Wait a minute.

359
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:44,340
- Hi.
- Hi.

360
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:46,701
You didn't actually say no.

361
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:47,571
What do you mean?

362
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,471
All this time you were, uh, you were
supposed to say no, but you didn't...

363
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:51,533
I checked the transcript.

364
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:56,081
So, here's what I'm proposing.
Uh... you only have two minutes, right?

365
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:56,982
Right.

366
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:00,502
Okay. You want to, uh...
go on a a two-minute date with me?

367
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:05,213
Last two-minute date I had
gave me a daughter.

368
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:07,710
But um... Okay.

369
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:08,623
Great.

370
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,342
And... go.

371
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:15,553
Taxi!

372
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:20,301
- I seriously only have two minutes...
- I know.

373
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:23,940
That's like 120 seconds.

374
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:25,863
380 West 22nd, please.

375
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:27,163
And step on it.
We're in a hurry.

376
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:29,773
380 West 22nd? That's...

377
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,722
- Right this way.
- Thank you, sir.

378
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:38,370
You know, I have always wanted
to try this place.

379
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,393
House salad.

380
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,371
- So, college?
- Stanford.

381
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:45,071
- Wesleyan.
- Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar?

382
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:47,192
No. Scott Crable?

383
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:50,413
- Eggplant parmesean.
- Thanks.

384
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:52,563
- Already cut up.
- Could we get the check please.

385
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:54,312
We're trying to make
a movie in 15 seconds.

386
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:55,663
- Of course.
- Okay, great.

387
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:56,852
Uh, how do you want to do this?

388
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:59,642
You had the eggplant parm.
I only really had water so...

389
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,773
I'm kidding.

390
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,392
Okay. Let's go.
Taxi!

391
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:05,801
- You nervous?
- A little bit.

392
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:07,552
- You can't tell at all.
- Oh, good.

393
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:09,583
Hello!

394
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,113
384 West 22nd.

395
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:22,470
- 15 seconds. The movie's started.
- Nah, previews. We'll be fine.

396
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,503
Ah! Just in time.
It hasn't started yet.

397
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,972
- So, what are we seeing?
- Manos: Hands of Fate.

398
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:32,972
- The whole thing?
- Only the important parts.

399
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,931
Worst movie ever.

400
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:43,291
Yeah, I almost walked out,
like, five times.

401
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:46,452
- How we doing on time? Taxi!
- We got a little time.

402
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,790
- Okay. Do you want to walk it?
- Why not?

403
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:49,913
Hello!

404
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,181
Good-bye!

405
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:54,323
So what grade's your daughter in?

406
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,213
- Third grade.
- Ah! That's a good year.

407
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,520
Yeah, she's wonderful.

408
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,993
I just wish that I could get her
to quit smoking, you know?

409
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:02,352
- What?
- I'm kidding.

410
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:04,263
Look, coffee and dessert?

411
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,863
You know, this neighborhood
just keeps on changing.

412
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:08,633
This used to be a cute,
little Italian restaurant.

413
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:09,660
I know. New York.

414
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:13,450
It's a living organism, an ever-changing
tapestry. Ooh, look at the time.

415
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,931
- Let's go.
- The cheesecake's amazing.

416
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:19,543
- Flowers?
- I'm allergic.

417
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:22,952
Okay. See? We're getting
to know each other.

418
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:26,941
Stella, I had a lovely...
Doggy bag?

419
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:30,920
- Stella, I had a lovely time.
- Me, too, Ted.

420
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:34,010
And... date.
Huh?

421
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:38,072
That wasn't so bad, right?
No lengthy, awkward silences.

422
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,780
Dessert ran a little long, so...
I had to cut the good-night kiss.

423
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,700
I think I can be late just once.

424
00:19:58,285 --> 00:20:01,132
Look, I would love to have
a second date, I would.

425
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:05,170
But I understand that you really don't
have time right now, but if you ever do,

426
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:06,431
will you give me a call?

427
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,813
- Yes.
- Okay.

428
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:16,400
<i>And that, kids, is how
you turn a "no" into a "yes."</i>

429
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,810
All my friends told me,
"Abby, be strong.

430
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,612
He doesn't deserve another chance."
But I forgive you!

431
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:25,973
No, no, no, no!

432
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,992
He seems so nice but then
he just kept toying with my emotions.

433
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,592
This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk.

434
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:42,223
You know your problem?
You're too sweet.

435
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,391
Aren't you going to see
the doctor about that mole?

436
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:47,222
Oh, yeah.
Turns out it's just a Raisinet.

437
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,862
Hey, how would you like me
to take you out to a fancy restaurant

438
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,181
and then go on a shopping spree?

439
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,531
Treat you the way
you should be treated.

440
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:59,820
Would that make you forget
about that Ted monster?

441
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:03,453
My mom was wrong.
There are nice guys in New York.

442
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:06,770
We just have to go
by my hotel room first.

443
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,663
My bed was broken.
I just have to make sure they fixed it.

444
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:12,442
Well, then if it's fixed,
can we have sex on it

445
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:14,593
and then go shopping.

446
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:17,302
I like you.
