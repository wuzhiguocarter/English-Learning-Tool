1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,910
it was saturday night in new york city,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,980
and the young metropolitan set
was out on the town,

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,350
living the kind of crazy lifestyle

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,220
you can only find in the big apple.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,250
a hundred

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,110
we only got 82 on our honeymoon.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,680
so, robin

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,510
mm? i've got a guy for you.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,280
oh?

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,250
he's cute.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,480
he's funny. he's smart.

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,180
what's his "but"? what do you mean?

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,680
when someone wants to set you up,

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,410
they always tell you their good qualities first, but

15
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,150
but then they leave out their huge flaw.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,780
she's totally hot and really fun.

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,610
but she has a dead tooth.

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,680
she's super-hot, and she's so successful.

19
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,250
but she has a pug

20
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,150
that she pushes around in a stroller.

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,050
she's so cute, and she's so smart.

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,450
but her last boyfriend had

23
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,110
get a restraining order against her,

24
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,750
and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,110
wow set her up

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,280
i'm still convinced

27
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,880
she killed my turtle.

28
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,310
hey you know what? not every setup has a "but."

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,780
what about, um, jamie, that girl

30
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,510
that lily set you up with? yeah.

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,510
she was really nice. if memory
serves me, she had a huge "but.

32
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,680
her huge butt.

33
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,010
nailed it!

34
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,580
yeah.

35
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,310
well, there's nothing wrong with this guy.

36
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,050
he's really nice, and he's really cute...

37
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,080
but

38
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,610
fine.

39
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,220
but he has a kid.

40
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,620
aha! there it is!

41
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,750
robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.

42
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,150
but the guy is really great, and his kid's sweet.

43
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,480
he's in my class.

44
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,210
it doesn't matter robin hates kids.

45
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,380
i don't hate kids.

46
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,650
you told me

47
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,850
even when you were a kid, you hated kids.

48
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,250
robin,will you watch

49
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,850
cartool with me?

50
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,510
i go to school all week.

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,510
can't i just have

52
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,910
five minutes to myself

53
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,660
to read highlights and drink my juice?

54
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,850
okay, yes, kids are not my favorite thing

55
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,580
in the world,but i like them

56
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,510
well, you don't want to have them.

57
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,780
i like sports cars, but it doesn't mean

58
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,280
i want to push a ferrari through my vagina.

59
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,910
shotgun.

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,650
you can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem.

61
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,410
i mean, if we were friends with garfield,

62
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,650
we wouldn't set him up on a date with mondays.

63
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,710
nice.

64
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,810
you know what the kid is not a problem i want to meet this guy.

65
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,210
okay. that's awesome! yeah.

66
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,480
hey, what's my "but"?

67
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,550
u know i'm a... i am really nice  but...

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,580
but she's afraid of commitments.

69
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,980
but she's a gun nut.

70
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,710
but she'scanadian.

71
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,310
but she didn't like field of dreams.

72
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,850
i can't think of...

73
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,860
you don't have a but.

74
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,660
i've got it. here. put on this eye patch.

75
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,960
why?

76
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,400
the ultimate ice-breaker.

77
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,370
a bunch of cobras got loose in central park.

78
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,600
you and i are jogging..

79
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,170
training for the death valley iron man.

80
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,900
no big deal. we do it every year.

81
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,170
mm-hmm suddenly,

82
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,570
we see these snake bastards

83
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,170
sneaking towards a little baby.

84
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,900
not on our watch.

85
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,800
you grab the kid

86
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,330
i strangle six cobras

87
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,060
with my bare hands.

88
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,860
women of new york, one at a time, please.

89
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,530
so what the the eye patches for?

90
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,340

91
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,240
on the eye?

92
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,130
yes.

93
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,500
both of us?

94
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,000
they're different eyes.

95
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,060
i don't know see why this bumps you!

96
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,060
patch up!

97
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,370
so robin went on a date with george,

98
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,470
the guy with the kid, and afterwards...

99
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,730
okay here's the thing.

100
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,900
george is

101
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,060
a great guy.

102
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,700
we had a wonderful date. but....

103
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,330
great i can't wait to meet him.

104
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,830
"can't wait to meet him"?

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,230
why did i say that?

106
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,200
i don't want to meet his kid. well, you knew

107
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,830
you'd meet him sooner or later.

108
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,660
oh. i was just hoping for later,

109
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,060
like in 20 years

110
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,100
when i'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.

111
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,430
robin, what's the big deal?

112
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,530
he's just a kid

113
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,470
he's not going to bite.

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,660
he may bite.

115
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,400
we're working on biting.

116
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,860
why is this kid around anyway?

117
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,300
shouldn't he be with his mom?

118
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,700
i mean, what kind of lawyer does this guy have

119
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,570
if he has to take care of the kid all the time

120
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,860
a good one.

121
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,230
he won full custody.

122
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,730
he won?! he won?

123
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,730
oh god, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?

124
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,200
don't tell anyone i said that.

125
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,530
mm. no.

126
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,800
i'm going out buying eye patches.

127
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,730
what are you doing to help score chicks?

128
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,030
okay, i'm going to let you in on a little secret.

129
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,700
people with real game don't need eye patches.

130
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,570
oh. theodore.

131
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,900
no no no

132
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,470
you can't spell "game" without me,

133
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,030
and me has the best game.

134
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,530
yeah, well,

135
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,700
i got so much game, i'm cornish game hen.

136
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,860
oh, yeah? i'm the new york state gaming commissioner.

137
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,170
well, i'm the game.

138
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,660
well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller

139
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,330
starring michael douglas and sean pen

140
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,760
wow.

141
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,500
wow. you're here

142
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,840
and not in stall two.

143
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,930
yeah. so

144
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,570
i may have made some

145
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,030
wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments

146
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,740
to a gentleman wearing your shoes.

147
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,430
okay, marshall? yes.

148
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,800
which one of us has more game?

149
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,130
neither of you guys has any game, right?

150
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,730
or else you'd be married like me.

151
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,600
what?

152
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,960
if dating is the game,

153
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,330
then marriage is winning the game.

154
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,100
yeah. if you're playing in the women's league.

155
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,100
you're joking.

156
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,000
i have mad game, brah.

157
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,100
okay one

158
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,400
we agreed not ever to say " brah"  any more

159
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,300
it was a good week, we had a lot of fun,

160
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,760
but it's over.

161
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,060
two

162
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,100
you've been with lily for 11 years.

163
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,300
your idea of good game

164
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,300
is slapping on a dr. seuce's hat

165
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,660
and flashing two tickets to a spin doctors concert.

166
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,210
yeah, i hate to say it, buddy,

167
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,710
-but, uh, you're kind of irrelevant

168
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,570
-what? i am not irrelevant.

169
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,900
i know tons of stuff.

170
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,330
i can help you guy

171
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,530
i don't want to be left out.

172
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,630
ted you do not have more game than me.

173
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,800
by sheer numbers

174
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,060
along i win.

175
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,860
come on, dude. you've seen my list.

176
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,270
you guys want to hear one of my lines?

177
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,900
first of all, i did not ask to see that list,

178
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,470
and i am still horrified.

179
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,530
and true game

180
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,940
is about quality, not quantity,

181
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,800
and a quality girl would pick me over you any day.

182
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,130
are you a model?

183
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,170
that one's good because it's flattering.

184
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,530
to the girl.

185
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,500
ted

186
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,800
i challenge you to a picking up girls olympiad.

187
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,570
fine there will be 26 events

188
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,860
spread out over 11 weeks.

189
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,630
we will travel to a neutral city

190
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,130
where a panel of internationa

191
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,960
or we could just choose a girl at first to seal the deal who wins

192
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,030
and that's good, too.mm-hmm.

193
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,270
how about her?

194
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,230
you're on.

195
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,430
before we start,

196
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,530
why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?

197
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,570
okay, great. rule #1: no eye patches

198
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,370
or props of any...

199
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,130
one time

200
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,860
i was with this girl, and i tried that model line,

201
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,370
and i totally got some over-the-shirt boob action

202
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,060
in the "just say no" assembly.

203
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,270
man, just stop.

204
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,270
you're bumming everybody out.

205
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,400
rule number two

206
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,540
the bet is for one million dollars.

207
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,170
i win.

208
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,070
how?

209
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,230
oh, i slept with her.

210
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,400
about a year ago.

211
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,500
i just forgot.

212
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,530
oh, well, that doesn't count.

213
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,500
the bet started the moment we shook.

214
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,230
but i can't sleep with her again,she hates me.

215
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,570
oh interesting.

216
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,160
look who just took a commanding lead.

217
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,630
-now with you out of the picture
i can take -ted, she's leaving.

218
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,960

219
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,300
by the look

220
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,240
of those shoes here comes
your bathroom buddy.

221
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,080
look who's got game.

222
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,330
so, you're a big kids person, huh?

223
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,460
only the biggest ever

224
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,960
i think kids are so great,

225
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,130
especially uh the ones, you know, uh... pudgy,

226
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,270
can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,170
you mean babies?

228
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,800
yeah, i like that kind.

229
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,930
well, doug's almost six,

230
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,230
oh, six is great.

231
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,000
oh, you are going to love six.

232
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,660
six is when they, uh, they really start to, um...

233
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,300
i hate kids.

234
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,630
excuse me. what?

235
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,300
i mean, i don't hate kids.

236
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,060
i'm-i'm just not a kid person.

237
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,760
i mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little,

238
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,730
but beyond that, what's the drawl?

239
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,830
you must think i'm nuts.

240
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
what? no, no, no. i...

241
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,370
so you don't like kids, so what?

242
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,370
and i'm not looking

243
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,030
for a mother for doug.

244
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,500
uh, why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?

245
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,730
yeah.

246
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,630
let's take things slow.

247
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,040
and kids, that's exactly what she did.

248
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,130
then, on a totally different date

249
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,830
that was definitely not the next morning,

250
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,170
aunt robin had to face her worst fear.

251
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,600
hey, what's up?

252
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,860
it's here, lily.

253
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,100
it's looking at me.

254
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,370
what?

255
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,400
the kid. what do i do?

256
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,030
just talk to him. you can do this, robin.

257
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,170
who are you?

258
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,330
um, i'm robin.

259
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,370
that's a bird's name.

260
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,530
ah, no, it's not

261
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,930
it's actually a type of bird.

262
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,730
my friend patrick has a parakeet named robin, so there.

263
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,980
do you want to talk in morse code?

264
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,550
dude, i'm-i'm just reading my paper, so...

265
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,230
i'm starving. will you make me cereal?

266
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,900
sure.

267
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,200
what are you doing? you're supposed

268
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,400
to pour the milk first.

269
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,860
what?! no, you pour the cereal first

270
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,530
so you know how much milk you need.

271
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,200
it tastes better milk first!

272
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,860
it all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.

273
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,660
why are you wearing my dad's pants?

274
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,980
milk first it is.

275
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,660
what are you reading?

276
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,760
the business section.

277
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,600
the fed's going to lower rates again

278
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,200
to bail out these sub-prime lenders.

279
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,800
bunch of idiots.

280
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,630
ms. aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.

281
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,470
well, maybe if they weren't such idiots,

282
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,370
i wouldn't have to call them that.

283
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,630
that's what i said.

284
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,960
you're pretty cool.

285
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,210
you too.

286
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
meanwhile stacey and i had start

287
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,630
oh, stacey was the girl from the bar.

288
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
anyway, i was close to winning the bet

289
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,060
when something unexpected happened.

290
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,860
i started to really like her.

291
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,100
well, have fun in yoga.

292
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,270
she's strengthening her core.

293
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,100
i think that's going to be good.

294
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,800
yeah? all right.

295
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,310
after a while, crocodile.

296
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,900
you see this?

297
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,010
game face.

298
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,550
whatever, ted get this.

299
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,350
she play bass

300
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,370
in a reggae band.

301
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,370
they're having a show this friday.

302
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,630
how cool is that?

303
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,910
oh, does she know that one song?

304
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,330
what's that song called?

305
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,930
oh, right. it's called every reggae song.

306
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,500
i am not irrelevant. what?

307
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,730
i ran the numbers.

308
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,600
if lily and i have sex twice a week,

309
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,630
which let's be honest, we all know is being conservative,

310
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,110
and we've been together

311
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,530
for ten years,

312
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,800
plus 17 more times on the honeymoon,

313
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,430
minus the two-week drought when i said the checker

314
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,710
at the grocery store might have met me and the young lily

315
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,630
then we have had sex a total of

316
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,930
-wait for it -nice.

317
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,160
1,053-1/2 times.

318
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,130
my mom called once.

319
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,700
but that's more times than barney

320
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,130
has ever had sex, and to your point, ted

321
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,600
lily is a quality girl.

322
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,800
i win.

323
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,680
lawyered.

324
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,960
doesn't count.

325
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,860
it totally counts.

326
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,030
you're right. it does count.

327
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,100
it counts as one.

328
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,500
you've had sex once.

329
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,170
how was it?

330
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,610
i still matter.

331
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,370
okay ted go win the bet.

332
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,330
you have my blessing she's a wonderful girl.

333
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,800
i should know.

334
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,170
oh, okay.

335
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,960
okay i see what you're doing.

336
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,830
we've never shared a woman, have we ted?

337
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,060
isn't that funny?

338
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,100
you're with her now.

339
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,630
i was with her a year ago

340
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,570
you figure, for her, that's like 200 showers ago.

341
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,270
you've got to ask yourself ted

342
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,960
"is 200 enough?"

343
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,860
you know what?

344
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,170
i don't mind.

345
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,800
no, of course you don't mind.

346
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,470
just lik the second guy to climb

347
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,730
mount everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top

348
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,400
only to find sir edmund hillary flat pole

349
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,730
thrust into its supple peak.

350
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,860
no, i'm sure when you're with her,

351
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,700
i'll be the furthest thing from your mind

352
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,960
kissing what i've already kissed,

353
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,800
nuzzling what i've already nuzzled,

354
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,570
going...

355
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,170
on what i've already gone  on.

356
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,600
barney, i'm not afraid

357
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,830
of catching your cooties, 'kay?

358
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,170
really? ted's not afraid of cooties?

359
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,200
no okay well then i guess you'd have no problem

360
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,500
having a sip of my g.d tonic.

361
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,710
fine

362
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,270
and i only stirred that with my pinky

363
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,000
guess who loves robin.

364
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,860
kids. kids love ted.

365
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,570
doug thinks i'm pretty cool.

366
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,760
really, that's great!

367
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,730
you and george, all thanks to me.

368
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,600
ah'i'm gonna have to break up with him.

369
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,760
what?

370
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,400
well, it's just.

371
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,330
it's getting a little bit too serious with the kid.

372
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,660
you know, it's just not

373
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,370
what i'm looking for.

374
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
better i break it off now

375
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,230
before he gets too attached.

376
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,230
what?

377
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,730
i hate to tell you this, but..

378
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,740
too late.

379
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,910
he drew it in class today.

380
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,960
there is no way  that's a picture of me.

381
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,430
that woman has on hoop earrings.

382
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,130
i don't even own hoop earrings.

383
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,590
i have one pair and they're gold.

384
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,890
those are fruit loops.

385
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,930
you are so in denial right now

386
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,860
and you're doing what you always do in relationships:

387
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,690
the second you get close to a guy, you want to bail.

388
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,730
okay, granted, he's six,

389
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,190
but the point stands.

390
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,860
well, we'll ask the guys.

391
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,630
they'll tell you that's not me.

392
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,960
that's totally you.

393
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,860
what... you guys are crazy.

394
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,530
hey, who drew the picture of robin?

395
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,530
it's not me.

396
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,590
you're joking right?

397
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,830
-it's not me! -"my new mommy."

398
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,160
kind of has a nice ring to it.

399
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,860
hey, now that you're a mom are you going to start wearing

400
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,370
those totally awesome jeans

401
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,430
that go right up to your boobs?

402
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,560
do you guys really think this is me?

403
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,990
honey, it's you.

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,860
and if you're going to break up with george,

405
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,530
you have to break up with his kid, too.

406
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,730
really?

407
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,490
yeah, you can't just abandon him.

408
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,990
you have to talk to him.

409
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,130
come on,  you know

410
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,360
it's the right thing to do.

411
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,330
oh, man.

412
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,140
doug was right you are a pa

413
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,830
so i had a really nice time tonight.

414
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,930
me, too.

415
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,200
yeah?

416
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,460
hey, ted, pucker up all you want,

417
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,970
but i was here first

418
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,560
from this spot, i also launched

419
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,860
an expedition those two large ridges

420
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,570
down there.

421
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,660
ted?

422
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,100
something wrong?

423
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,730
hey, doug.

424
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,160
are you here to see my dad?

425
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,560
he's taking a shower.

426
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,830
actually, i came to see you.

427
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,930
i wrote a poem.

428
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,390
do you want to hear it

429
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,490
sure. why not?

430
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,870
"to my new mommy"

431
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,660
"you are pretty"

432
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,490
"you are nice"

433
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,490
"and you smell like daisies"

434
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,090
aw, that is so sweet.

435
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,090
even though it doesn't right

436
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,020
look, uh, doug.

437
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,360
there's no good way to say this

438
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,790
aunt robin didn't know to what to say.

439
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,190
this kid has never been dumped before.

440
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,990
but then she realized...

441
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,790
this kid had never been dumped before.

442
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,790
she could use every cliche in the book.

443
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,030
we need to talk.

444
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,130
i just think, hum

445
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,460
we both could use some space right now.

446
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,460
it's not you. it's me.

447
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,490
i know this hurts, but you deserts someone better

448
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,060
i'm just really trying to focus on my career right now.

449
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,630
you know?

450
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,040
i just hope we can still be friends.

451
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,830
hi, i'm brooke.

452
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,240
i'm here for my date with george.

453
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,570
you must be

454
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,600
the babysitter.

455
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,860
i had so much coffee earlier.

456
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,140
i need to run to the loo, but hey, dougie.

457
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,290
what the hell was that?

458
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,630
that was my new mom.

459
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,360
so... this picture is not of me?

460
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,430
why would i draw a picture of you?

461
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,360
wha...?

462
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,190
how many dates has she been on with your dad?

463
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,330
two.

464
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,440
i've been on five

465
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,530
and you like her better?

466
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,660
we just really connected.

467
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,030
and what about me?

468
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,360
you think i just go around pouring cereal

469
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,930
for every boy in town?

470
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,660
why are you getting so upset, roberta?

471
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,140
robin my name is robin.

472
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,990
like the bird, remember?

473
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,930
whatever.

474
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,090
so that's it, huh?

475
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,930
look, you're great, but...

476
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,430
yeah. there's always a "but."

477
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,860
well, i couldn't do it.

478
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,290
i broke up with her.

479
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,790
thanks a lot, by the way.

480
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,360
a beautiful, sexy girl

481
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,790
and all i could think about you being there first.

482
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,930
you were stuck in my head like chumbawamba song.

483
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,990
which chumbawamba song?

484
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,990
well, what an interesting turn of events

485
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,290
it looks like i'm going to win.

486
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,130
what do you mean "win"? you couldn't even talk to her.

487
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,760
you tried and you got slapped. mm-hmm

488
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,060
that's what you think happened.

489
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,190
okay, great, rule no.1:

490
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,560
no eye patch or props of any...

491
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,560
here's the deal:  my friend just got dumped, so he's a little shy,

492
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,590
but i'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you.

493
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,790
the problem is, she this a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him.

494
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,260
so would you slap me across the face so he can see

495
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,530
you're not into guys who'd feed you lines?

496
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,630
what do you say? for my friend?

497
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,430
you are so sweet.

498
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,330
so now, whatever nice things

499
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,790
ted does for her, in her mind,

500
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,630
i'm the guy who's even nicer than him.

501
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,890
so you never slept with her?

502
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,730
not even at all.

503
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,890
wow, that's good.

504
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,190
it gets better.

505
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,590
remember ted's phone conversation?

506
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,160
we have fun in yoga.

507
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,800
well..

508
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,290
i am... sorry.

509
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,890
stacey, right?

510
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,790
yeah... oh, you're ted's friend fro||the bar, right?

511
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,990
yeah. wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here, too.

512
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,190
i do.

513
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,260
she plays bass in a reggae band.

514
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,430
and then i'm going to head out to a reggae concert.

515
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,490
i'm a huge an of reggae.

516
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,760
oh my gosh!

517
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,430
i play in a reggae band.

518
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,860
no way.

519
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,160
i wonder why ted didn't tell me about that.

520
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,590
like i said, i'm a huge reggae fan.

521
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,990
well... i should go inside.

522
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,490
after a while, crocodile.

523
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,930
see you later, allig... see you later, allig..

524
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,160
we are two ears.

525
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,930
wow, well, take care.

526
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,970
um, namaste.

527
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,090
you are a sociopath.

528
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,990
and that was my yoga mat.

529
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,390
so now with ted out of the picture,

530
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,530
i'm going to swoop in and win the whole thing.

531
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,900
why? parce que j'ai le jeu, mes  iennes.

532
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,690
translation:

533
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,460
"cause i got game, bitches"

534
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,060
no no this doen't prove anything because...

535
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,460
hold on a second.

536
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,960
it's stace .

537
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,790
hey, stace?

538
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,960
what happened?

539
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,630
he did not!

540
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,630
stay there.

541
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,700
i'll be right over.

542
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,170
i should've just rn that stupid eye patch.

543
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,330
oh, i can't believe you got dumped by a six years old.

544
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,330
whatever he's a stupid-head.

545
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,330
i'm just... i'm done with kids.

546
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,330
of course, ted eventually made her peace with kids.

547
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,390
and as you guy know she went on to appear

548
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,480
in some very important works of art: yours.

549
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,790
US And Aunt Robin

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,380
US and Aunt Robin At THE ZOO

551
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,840
US AND AUNT ROBIN AT THE BEACH

552
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,210
one month later

553
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,080
hey

554
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,710
you know, i really appreciate

555
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,850
how cool you've been
about us taking things slow.

556
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,350
since ted, you know, i...

557
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,950
i don't really want to get physical too fast.

558
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,280
that's what makes you so special, baby.

559
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,250
anyway, i am so psyched

560
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,880
to be playing sunsplash tomorrow.

561
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,080
we go on sometime
between 11:00 and 6:00,

562
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,610
so you probably want to get there
before 9:00 just to be safe.

563
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,990
oh, and it's gonna be muddy.
