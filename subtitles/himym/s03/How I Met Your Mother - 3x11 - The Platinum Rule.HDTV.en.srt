1
00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:01,994
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:03,988
I have a tattoo.

3
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:05,348
Oh, that's not a tattoo.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,010
That, dear boy,
is a tramp stamp.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,950
A tramp stamp.

6
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,302
<i>Kids, too often in life,</i>

7
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:15,129
<i>we make decisions that we're
not prepared to live with.</i>

8
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:18,909
<i>This is a story
about those decisions,</i>

9
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,126
<i>and the consequences
that follow.</i>

10
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:26,240
Say good-bye, kids,
'cause it won't be around much longer.

11
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,372
Oh, but Ted, if you get rid
of the butterfly,

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,549
how's everyone gonna know
you're a stripper from Reno

13
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:32,677
with Daddy issues?

14
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:35,791
Yes, yes, enjoy these
final moments of mockery

15
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:39,440
because in just ten surprisingly
expensive sessions,

16
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:43,073
Stella is gonna zap that butterfly
right off the face of my lower back.

17
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:44,210
Stella?

18
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,223
Dr. Stella Zinman.
She's the best in the business.

19
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:49,950
And she's rather cute. In fact...
we're going to a movie together tonight.

20
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:51,592
- What?
- I asked her out.

21
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,771
- Ted, why would you do that?
- What's the matter with you?

22
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,570
- What? What do you mean?
- Dude...

23
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,402
don't poop where you eat.

24
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:00,413
Oh, no, this doesn't count.

25
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,583
If it's someone you see
on a regular basis,

26
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:03,670
and you can't avoid them...

27
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:06,641
And in this case, you're paying
them... then yes, it counts.

28
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:09,210
Ted, you've heard
of the Golden Rule, right?

29
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:10,162
"Love thy neighbor?"

30
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,070
Uh, actually, it's "Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you."

31
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:14,903
It's from the Bible.

32
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,853
Damn it, Ted, I've worked out
this whole thing

33
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:21,102
where the Golden Rule is
"Love thy neighbor," so just... okay?

34
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,553
Now, the Golden Rule is
"Love thy neighbor."

35
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:26,710
But there's one
rule above it:

36
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:28,942
the Platinum Rule:

37
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:33,781
"Never ever, ever, ever,
love thy neighbor."

38
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,540
Well, that's cute. But she's not
my neighbor, she's my doctor.

39
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:39,261
- So if you'll excuse me...
- Ted, Barney has a point.

40
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:41,653
Remember what happened with me
and Curt down at the station?

41
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:44,421
Oh, yeah, and remember what happened
with us and the Gerards across the hall?

42
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:46,643
Need I remind you
about me and Wendy the Waitress?

43
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:48,020
Yeah, I don't have time
for this.

44
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:50,731
I'm out the door as soon
as I'm finished with my hair.

45
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:53,190
Good, then we've got
a solid half hour.

46
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:57,801
And in that time, we will convince
you not to set foot out that door.

47
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,480
It's a story older
than time, my friend,

48
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,161
and it always plays out
in the same eight steps.

49
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,553
Step 1: Attraction.

50
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:08,972
- It's true.
- That's not even possible.

51
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:10,462
- 12 of them.
- There's no way.

52
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:11,462
- Hi, Barney.
- Hey.

53
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,121
- Here's your gin and tonic.
- Thanks.

54
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,232
Oh, gosh.
Look at that.

55
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,731
Oh, hi! You must be our
new neighbors. I'm Michael.

56
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:24,750
And I'm Laura.

57
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:26,462
Oh, hi, welcome
to the building. Yeah.

58
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,992
Do you guys know any good
brunch places around here?

59
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:31,101
We love brunch!

60
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,320
You must be Robin.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,320
Yeah.

61
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,021
Curt "The Iron Man" Irons.

62
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,342
I'm gonna be doing sports.

63
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,450
Oh. Welcome.

64
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:46,201
You look really familiar.
Are you a former athlete?

65
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:47,411
Hockey.

66
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:51,303
<i>The attraction is
instant and undeniable.</i>

67
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:52,953
But you know better.

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,443
You've seen your friends
make the same mistakes before.

69
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:57,812
You've laughed smugly at them.

70
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,770
Idiots.

71
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,881
But still, you think,

72
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,450
"This is different. The Platinum Rule
doesn't apply to me."

73
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,500
And that's Step 2.

74
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,700
Bargaining.

75
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:12,243
I think I've got a little crush
on our sports guy.

76
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:14,061
- No, don't do it.
- No. No, no, no, no.

77
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:18,011
I know, I know. But he used to
play hockey, and I'm a Canadian.

78
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,161
I can't help it.

79
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,863
If he were missing some teeth,
I probably would've already hit that.

80
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,552
Robin, it's a mistake.

81
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:26,391
Remember what happened
with me and Marshall?

82
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:27,950
The Gerards across the hall?

83
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,543
Michael and Laura.
They're awesome!

84
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,373
We're gonna invite them
over for dinner.

85
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,931
- No! Really?
- Are you insane?

86
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:36,190
Guys, guys, guys,
this is New York City.

87
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:37,920
You don't get close
to the neighbors.

88
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,892
You nod at them politely
in the hall.

89
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,153
You call the cops if you haven't
seen them in a while

90
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:44,291
and you smell something
funny, and that is it.

91
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:47,030
We're not gonna date them.
We're just gonna be friends with them.

92
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:49,032
That's the couples
version of dating.

93
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,873
And you've got the couples
version of the hots for them.

94
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:54,903
Oh, yeah, you want to eat brunch with them.
You want to browse at Pottery Barn with them.

95
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:57,321
You want to go antiquing
with them, don't you?

96
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:00,990
Oh, yeah, you want to antique
the crap out of them.

97
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:04,900
Need I remind you what happened
with me and Wendy the Waitress?

98
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:07,990
I've decided to seduce
Wendy the Waitress.

99
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:10,111
- Don't do it!
- No! Request denied!

100
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:13,871
What rule is there that says I can't
seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?

101
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,431
I don't know. I'd expect you
to have one already.

102
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:18,292
Yeah, with some sort
of catchy name.

103
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:19,661
Well, I don't.

104
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,923
I don't have one and I never will be
because it's a great idea.

105
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,072
Come on, guys.
She's gullible.

106
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,373
I'm bored.
We're perfect for each other.

107
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:30,033
Barney.
We love this bar.

108
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,353
If you screw over Wendy the Waitress,
you're going to kill the bar.

109
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,993
- Bar-killer.
- Don't kill the bar, dude.

110
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:39,110
Yeah, well...
I think it'll be okay.

111
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:42,290
And it was a huge mistake.

112
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,683
Yeah, well...
I think it'll be okay.

113
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:47,741
And it was a huge mistake.

114
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:50,922
Yeah, well...
I think it'll be okay.

115
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,080
And it was a huge mistake.

116
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:57,773
Yeah, well...
I think it'll be okay.

117
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,810
How I Met Your Mother 3x11
<i>- The Platinum Rule -</i>

118
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,631
Ted, trust me.
You don't want to do this.

119
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,663
Look, Stella and I
are both adults.

120
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:20,090
We're both smart, mature people
capable of making good decisions.

122
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:23,223
You have a butterfly
tramp stamp.

124
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:27,202
We're just seeing a movie.
If it seems at all weird, I'll back off.

126
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:31,163
That's what everyone thinks.
And then along comes Step 3:

127
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,071
Submission.

128
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,192
- Night.
- Hey, Barney.

129
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:39,302
Carl had to take off.
You mind giving me a hand?

130
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:41,950
Not at all.

131
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:47,282
Robin. I got two tickets
to the Rangers. Center ice.

132
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:48,830
Want to go?

133
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:53,022
And then we discover the movers
lost all our kitchen boxes.

134
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:54,923
We don't have
a single pot or pan.

135
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,770
Guess we're ordering
take-out.

136
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,850
Want to have dinner
with us tonight?

137
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:26,291
- I love them.
- Me, too.

138
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:37,930
That was an interesting use
of the beverage gun.

139
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,161
Club soda can get
anything off.

140
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,291
It finally happened.

141
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,083
All this time,

142
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,272
every drink I brought you...

143
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:50,600
I always felt there was this
unspoken connection between us.

144
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,512
And I was right.

145
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,789
Hey, can I get
a gin and tonic?

146
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:58,447
See, I bet you didn't pay
for that gin and tonic.

147
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,531
Oh, I paid for it.

148
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:04,063
But you got to admit, there is an upside
to breaking The Platinum Rule.

149
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,092
Like maybe as her boyfriend,
I could get a discount on treatments.

150
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,861
Oh, Ted.
Of course there's an upside.

151
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:12,161
At first. That's Step 4.

152
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:13,953
Perks.

153
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,022
<i>We can split a cab
to work together.</i>

154
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,790
We always have
a standing lunch date.

155
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,670
And last night,
at the hockey game,

156
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:23,561
Curt got us into the locker room,
and I met Mason Raymond.

157
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:26,091
Left Wing for the
Vancouver Canucks.

158
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,191
What's the opposite
of name-dropping?

159
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,731
Damn it, you guys.
Be psyched.

160
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:35,170
Yes, we see each other every day,
but I think it's going really well.

161
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:36,842
That's what we thought.

162
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:40,230
And it's so convenient.
They're right across the hall.

163
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:44,493
Say it's Sunday, and we want to have
a brunch double date with someone?

164
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:45,920
We just go across the hall.

165
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:49,691
And say we want to have
a dinner party exploring the wine

166
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,323
and cuisine of France's
Loire Valley?

167
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,102
We just go across the hall.

168
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:55,432
Say we want to play
a game of charades...

169
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,350
You just go
across the hall?

170
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,482
Come on, people.
Get excited for us.

171
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,811
We've got a great thing
going here.

172
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,420
That's what I thought.

173
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,703
- Dude, you got to flick it.
- You don't...

174
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:16,870
Hi, sweetie.

175
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,162
I had the kitchen whip
these up, no charge.

176
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,500
Okay, bye.

177
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:27,403
I mean, not bye.
I'm not leaving.

178
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,312
I'll be over there.

179
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,233
Come on, guys.
Free nachos.

180
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:39,713
What?

181
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,382
- We like this bar.
- Don't kill the bar, dude.

182
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:44,243
- Nay, we love this bar.
- Don't kill the bar, dude.

183
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:46,152
- This bar is like home to us.
- Don't kill the bar, dude.

184
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,542
You're killing the bar.

185
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,990
I am not killing the bar.

186
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,383
Wendy the Waitress has seen
how I operate in this place.

187
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,782
It is perfectly clear
to everyone involved

188
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:58,272
that this is nothing more
than a temporary fling.

189
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,433
It's fine.

190
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:07,383
But it wasn't.

191
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,111
It's fine.

192
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:11,051
But it wasn't.

193
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:12,991
It's fine.

194
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:14,940
But it wasn't.

195
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:17,363
Which brings us to Step 5:

196
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:18,842
The tipping point

197
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:21,521
...but he should be back
on the mound by spring training.

198
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:24,022
And that's sports.
Back to you, Robin.

199
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,521
Thanks, Iron Man.
We'll be right back.

200
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,001
<i>And clear.</i>

201
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,561
So want to do
something later?

202
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,991
Oh, so you're talking to me now?

203
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:35,012
What are you talking about?

204
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,413
I'm talking about last night.

205
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:39,242
You said you'd call
and you didn't.

206
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,911
I missed you and I waited up,
but you didn't call.

207
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,561
That really hurt.

208
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:48,273
Um, I'm-I'm sorry,
I-I guess I just forgot.

209
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:52,243
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I don't wanna fight tonight.

210
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,361
It's our first weekiversary.

211
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:02,832
Hey, Wendy,

212
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:04,933
uh, do me a favor and
send a glass of champagne

213
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,330
to that pretty young thing
over there.

214
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:07,492
What?

215
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,973
Over there.

216
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:14,543
You.

217
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:17,252
You're the pretty young thing...

218
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:19,150
is what I meant.

219
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,333
Champagne? Would you? On me.

220
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,092
Oh. Okay.

221
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:25,453
Thanks, sweetie.

222
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,712
Okay. All right.

223
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:34,621
Hey, neighbors.

224
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,463
We bought all the fixings
for a Mexican fiesta.

225
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:41,261
Well, we actually
have tickets...

226
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:43,020
And no fiesta would
be complete without...

227
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,473
Dude, actually,
we made other plans, so...

228
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,052
Okay. One word.
Two syllables.

229
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,052
Sounds like...

230
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:51,932
..."parade." Charades.

231
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,190
- Charades.
- What do you say?

232
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,652
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

233
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,310
Which brings usto Step 6.

234
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,621
Yeah, listen, I'm leaving so,

235
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,121
if you want to write
the rest of these down,

236
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,632
I will read it tomorrow.

237
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,291
- Don't do this, Ted.
- You want to get out of the way?

238
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:23,011
Don't do this, Ted.
Don't.

239
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,023
It was perfect!

240
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,893
You're such a jerk.

241
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,063
Which brings us
to Step 6.

242
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:32,281
You finally realize
you've made a huge mistake

243
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:35,591
and now you have to live with it.
Step 6 is called Purg...

244
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,703
Wait for it.

245
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,231
Keep waiting...

246
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,801
keep waiting for all eternity only
to discover there's no escape... atory.

248
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,031
God, I'm such an idiot.

249
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:47,733
Yeah.

250
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:50,870
Curt "The Iron Man" Irons

251
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:53,280
keeps leaving me
love notes on Post-Its.

252
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:55,502
On the teleprompter,
on my desk,

253
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:58,431
on the coffee-maker,
on the jar of sugar packets

254
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:00,302
next to the coffee-maker.

255
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:02,773
"Here's some sugar
for my sugar."

256
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,150
The Iron Man.

257
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:08,812
I remember that.

258
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,612
God, we are such idiots.

259
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:11,683
Yup.

260
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:15,313
Every time we step out the door,
they're out there waiting for us.

261
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:18,521
Sometimes, we'll send Ted out
first as a scout.

262
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:19,722
Nobody's there.

263
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,893
Then we'll go out one second
later, and there they are.

264
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:25,221
It's freakin' supernatural.
Are they ghosts?

265
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:26,293
Can only we see them?

266
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,101
"Hey, neighbor. Hey, neighbor.
Hey, neighbor." Oh.

267
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:32,813
I remember that.

268
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,650
How could you guys let me date
Wendy the Waitress?

269
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:36,900
- Oh, you are kidding me.
- What?!

270
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:39,173
- Don't kill the bar, dude.
- We said, "Don't do it."

271
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,803
My own bar.

272
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,582
I can't hit on women
in my own bar.

273
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:57,043
Remember the old Barney?
He's a lion,

274
00:12:57,195 --> 00:13:00,801
the king of the jungle,
stalking whatever prey he chose,

275
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:03,213
going in for the kill.

276
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:06,113
You've got a whole meat locker at home
full of corpses, don't you?

277
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:07,572
Now look at me.

278
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:10,113
Declawed. Neutered.

279
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:13,232
What was once
my jungle is now my zoo.

280
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:17,332
And I am forced to mate
with the same old lioness

281
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,232
again and again and again,

282
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,652
while families pay to watch.

283
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,150
Yeah, this metaphor's really
falling apart.

284
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:30,161
Put a bell around my neck
and scratch my belly, kids,

285
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:34,472
for I am just
a docile housecat now.

286
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,621
Meow.

287
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,220
Well, we love this bar.

288
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:42,823
You can't dump her.
Marry her if you have to.

289
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:45,690
Wendy the Waitress-Hyphen-Stinson.

290
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,210
Don't kill the bar, dude.

291
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,321
And so, inevitably,

292
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:55,821
you have to do the thing
you've been dreading all along.

293
00:13:56,008 --> 00:14:00,453
Now, a relationship-ectomy
is a delicate surgery as it is,

294
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,221
but in the case of
the Platinum Rule,

295
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:05,493
it takes a very, very
steady hand,

296
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,691
and that's Step 7:

297
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,912
Confrontation.

298
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,361
Curt...

299
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,192
... we need to talk.

300
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:18,772
I like you...

301
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,532
Guys, we like you a lot...

302
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:21,901
I don't like you.

303
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:26,192
We're pretending this works,
but it doesn't.

304
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:28,531
And I'm getting a little
sick of the whole charade.

305
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,432
We're getting
a little sick of charades.

306
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,751
I mean, I don't like you
that way.

307
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:34,511
I used to like
you that way.

308
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,563
But now that I've seen everything
there is to see,

309
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:39,240
I don't know, I kind of want
to see those same parts

310
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,321
just, on other girls.

311
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:45,932
So maybe, we could go back
to just being coworkers.

312
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:49,673
Maybe we should just go
back to being neighbors.

313
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:52,832
Other girls and you,
if you're into that.

314
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:55,182
But the other girls
have to be there, too.

315
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:57,823
That's the important part.

316
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:03,392
Gosh, you're just terrified of ever
getting close to anyone, aren't you?

317
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:06,320
Or that.
Let's say it's that.

318
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,151
So can I get a gin and tonic?

319
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,923
And in any other relationship,
that would be it.

320
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,120
End of story.

321
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,531
But because you have
to see this person again,

322
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,240
there's a Step 8:

323
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:20,802
Fallout.

324
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:25,211
And now, here's
Curt "The Iron Man" Irons with sports.

325
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:26,880
Curt?

326
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,190
Curt?

327
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:39,233
Well, the Knicks lost.

328
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:41,033
It's sad, really.

329
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,713
They had a real shot.

330
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:46,662
Then, out of nowhere,
game over.

331
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:48,793
And why?

332
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:51,040
Why, Robin?

333
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:55,701
Uh, well, their perimeter shooting
has been a little bit off this season...

334
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,320
The Knicks lost because
they were afraid of getting hurt.

335
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,022
So they didn't even try.

336
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:01,820
Well, you know what I think?

337
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,411
I think

338
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:05,993
the Knicks didn't deserve
my love to begin with.

339
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:08,352
The Knicks suck.

340
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,173
And that's sports.

341
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:19,490
<i>- Do you see anything?
- I think we're clear.</i>

342
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:21,170
Okay, go, go, go!

343
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,852
- That was close.
- Too close.

344
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:35,943
You've got to be kidding me.
What do we do?

345
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:37,351
I have no idea.

346
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:42,070
Guys, are you there? I forgot
my keys. Can you open up?

347
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:43,741
It's just Ted.

348
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,052
Wait!

349
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:50,373
Hello?
Guys?

350
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,471
Baby, we only have one choice.

351
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:03,243
Okay, hurry! Michael
and Laura are probably...

352
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,723
Hey, neighbors.

353
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:12,192
Barney, I just want you to know,
I have no hard feelings.

354
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:15,041
It wasn't the best idea
for us to get involved.

355
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,323
I hope we can still be friends.

356
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,832
Thanks, Wendy.
Of course we can.

357
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,971
If you need anything else,
let me know.

358
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:27,410
I've got to hand it to Wendy the
Waitress, that was very mature of her.

359
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,560
She's gonna try to kill me.

360
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:31,963
This is poisoned.

361
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,212
- What? You're being ridiculous.
- Yours is poisoned, too.

362
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,681
She's trying to kill me
and everyone close to me.

363
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,532
What are you talking about?

364
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:42,521
Look at the facts, I dump her
and she says, "No hard feelings."

365
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:46,012
She's a psycho!
What other explanation is there?

366
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,533
Uh, that you're letting yourself
believe she's crazy

367
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,701
so you don't have to face the far
more likely possibility that

368
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:52,981
she doesn't want
to date you either?

369
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:56,302
Where did Marshall
get that hamburger?

370
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,821
I don't know, I guess Wendy
the Waitress brought it to him.

371
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:03,023
Nooooooo!

372
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:10,282
Dude.

373
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:11,833
You're welcome.

374
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:13,541
Wait a second.

375
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:15,181
You've been sitting here,

376
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,132
pretending to be
the expert on all this,

377
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:21,582
but the truth is, there was no
real fallout from your breakup at all?

378
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:23,503
Yet.

379
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:24,712
You're an idiot.

380
00:18:25,258 --> 00:18:26,431
All right, I'm taking off.

381
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:28,662
- What?!
- I have a date.

382
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,172
You are such a jerk!

383
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:35,563
Ted, have you not
been listening?

384
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:39,151
Attraction, bargaining, submission,
perks, tipping point,

385
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,071
purgatory,
confrontation, fallout!

386
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:44,153
These things will all happen to you
as surely as they happened to all of us!

387
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:45,631
It's a rule of nature!

388
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:48,891
Well, I'm sick of all the rules!
There's too many of them!

389
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:51,923
The Hot/Crazy Scale, the Lemon Law,
the Platinum Rule...

390
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:54,643
If everyone in the world followed
every one of your rules,

391
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:57,003
the human race
would cease to exist.

392
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,663
Yes, chances are

393
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:01,272
Stella and I are not going
to live happily ever after.

394
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,902
The overwhelming odds
have it ending badly.

395
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:07,532
And when that happens, it'll be
for one of a million possible reasons.

396
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,543
But that doesn't mean
I'm not gonna try.

397
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:12,142
And when it does fail,
so help me God,

398
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,242
it's not gonna
be because of some rule.

399
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:18,621
P.S.

400
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:21,301
you just made my hair
look awesome.

401
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,341
Good night.

402
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,510
<i>So Stella and I went
on our date.</i>

403
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:29,010
<i>But here's the funny thing:</i>

404
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:31,501
<i>turns out,
it wasn't actually a date.</i>

405
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:33,941
So what do you mean
"it wasn't a date"?

406
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:36,913
She thought we were seeing
a movie just as friends.

407
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:38,162
Why would she think that?

408
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:40,401
Did she see your tattoo
and assume you were gay?

409
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:44,020
Apparently, there's a rule
that says I can't date Stella.

410
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,570
Exactly: the Platinum Rule.

411
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,932
Stella reads my blog.

412
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:50,672
No, this rule comes from the
American Medical Association.

413
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,152
Doctors aren't legally allowed
to date their patients.

414
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:55,050
Oh, sorry, Ted.

415
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:56,330
It's okay.

416
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,680
What are you guys watching?

417
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:01,382
<i>So that was the end of the story
between me and Stella,</i>

418
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,223
<i>at least for the time being.</i>

419
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:05,963
<i>But I don't know, looking back
on the Platinum Rule,</i>

420
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,740
<i>I think there's a ninth step.</i>

421
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,483
<i>We'll call it Coexistence.</i>

422
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,021
<i>It's the moment you realize
that all that anger</i>

423
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,823
<i>and resentment
just isn't useful.</i>

424
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,203
- Thanks for watching.
- Good night.

425
00:20:18,598 --> 00:20:20,210
<i>And you start to let go of it.</i>

426
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:21,751
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

427
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:24,132
So what do you guys
have going on tonight?

428
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:25,853
We're going to have
a few friends over.

429
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:26,932
Gonna play some charades.

430
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,030
Have fun.

431
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,281
<i>And move on with your life.</i>

432
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,050
<i>It just takes a while.</i>

433
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:37,332
On the house.

434
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,300
Thanks.

9999
