1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,460
Well, kids, here we are.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,800
We've arrived

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,130
My 30th birthday.

4
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,130
The long-awaited story of...

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,560
...the goat.

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,960
That week started just like any other.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,730
Barney woke up in some girl's bed.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,500
In my experience, the way this normally goes is,

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,530
We lie here for a while,

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,660
Make a little awkward chitchat.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,060
Check.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,400
Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery,

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,600
Rocket test flight I've got to be at,

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Slip out of the apartment and never call you again.

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,230
And later at the bar,

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,530
You tell your good friend robin

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,960
The story of your latest conquest,

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,900
And she thinks to herself,

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,030
"who is this sad,  self-loathing idiot

20
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,430
Who climbed into bed with barney stinson?"

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,460
Actually, you usually say that out loud.

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,600
So...

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,400
...i just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,260
And I just slept

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,330
With my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Best friend.

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,930
Okay, here's the deal, barney.

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,730
The second my feet touch the ground,

29
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,600
This never happened.

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,100
Okay.

31
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,260
Wait.

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,230
Right click, save as...

33
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,160
Into the .bpeg folder, and okay.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,660
This never happened.

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,300
It's a good plan.

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,260
Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.

37
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,830
Okay.

38
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,530
Okay.

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,760
Right.

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,700
So, robin?

41
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,130
Yes, barney?

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,030
Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?

43
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,930


44
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,600


45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,500
Okay, uh, I am gonna take a shower,

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,830
Till june, and, um,

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,260
Since you were never here to begin with,

48
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,130
You won't be here when I get out.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,330
-Okay. -okay.

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,860
This never happened.

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,730
Never happened.

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,630
Never... happened.

53
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,030
But pretending it never happened

54
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,300
Wouldn't be that easy.

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,730
So, tell us,

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,700
What was it like?

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,800
What?

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,060
penetrating that barrier.

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,730
You and I are the first ones to hit it.

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,860
Well, not the first ones,

61
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,700
Certainly, but the first ones at this table.

62
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,200
I... I...

63
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,800
I'm... I'm...

64
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,460
Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.

65
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,100
yeah, you are.

66
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,130
Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,730
It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there.

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.

69
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,000
What are you taking about?!

70
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,100
The big three-oh.

71
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,930
You know,My 30th birthday's this friday.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,860
Did you forget?

73
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,100
What kind of friend is this guy?

74
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,560
Ha-ha right.

75
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,500
A great friend, by the way.

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
The best.

77
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,230
Is it my imagination,

78
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,660
Or are these drinks getting smaller?

79
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,960
If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, "try again."

80
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,430
How you doing there, robin?

81
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,700
-I'm good. -Oh, so, I made a a decision.

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm going to go through all my old stuff,

83
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,000
And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore.

84
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,230
Hmm.  barney, you want my xbox?

85
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,030
Ted, she has a name!

86
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,500
And just what are you accusing me of?

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,600
Liking video games?

88
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm gonna get a drink.

89
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,130
I'll come with you.

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,030
Okay.

91
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,330
God, this is awkward.

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,760
What is?

93
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,160
Being around ted.

94
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,260
Why?

95
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,600
-Because of our thing.-what thing?

96
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,430
You're really gonna pretend this never happened?

97
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,460
What never happened?

98
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,300
What are you guys talking about?

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,300
Nothing.

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,130
Guys, cut the act. I know.

101
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,230
I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me.

102
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
Marshall let it slip earlier today.

103
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,760
Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything.

104
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,200
Just be sure to invite stella.

105
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,760
Stella!

106
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,500
You have a serious girlfriend now!

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
You're over this one.

108
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,760
Robin who, right?

109
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,500
Stella makes this one look

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,000
Like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right?

111
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,830
Happy birthday, bro.

112
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,760
Hello.

113
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,360
Hey, marshall, I need your help.

114
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,730
Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,860
I know. I want to hire you.

116
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,900
For the last time, barney, I will not be your butler.

117
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,560
I need a lawyer.

118
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,100
I'll pay you.

119
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,800
How much?

120
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,000
A little.

121
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,260
I'll take it.

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,960
Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say,

123
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,630
This might be a little bit over my head.

124
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,930
For one thing, I'm fairly certain

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,960
That if these contracts aren't executed precisely,

126
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,960
We will be at war with portugal.

127
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,130
Forget that.

128
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,460
That's a tuesday for me.

129
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,960
New shredder.

130
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,630
This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds.

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,500
From sky mall.it's all from sky mall.

132
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,330
Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall.

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,930
-Want a hot dog? -of course.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,630
Why are you upset?

135
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,030
Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret

136
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,030
That you can't tell anyone-- not ted,

137
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,060
Not robin, not lily.

138
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,230
No. no, no, no,  I don't want any more secrets,

139
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,060
Especially now that I know what you guys did

140
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,060
To the drinking water in lisbon. i...

141
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,360
You are hearing this secret, marshall.

142
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,430
I... I slept...

143
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,030
Stop..stop doing that.

144
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,160
I slept...

145
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,100
I slept with robin.

146
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,530
You slept with robin?

147
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,860
Are you mad at me?

148
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,400
I don't know.

149
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,030
How's the hot dog?

150
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,500
It's helping.

151
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,730
You slept with robin?!

152
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,160
I... I cannot keep that secret.

153
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,960
I mean, you know

154
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,830
I at least have to tell lily.

155
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,130
You can't. you can't tell anyone.

156
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,900
Attorney-client privilege.

157
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,960
Why are you doing this to me?!

158
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,460
Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer,

159
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,300
to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.

160
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,400
How can I help you as your lawyer?

161
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,830
You didn't break any laws, did you?

162
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?

163
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,560
I didn't break any state or federal laws,

164
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,130
but I think I broke a much, much higher law.

165
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,860
The Bro Code.

166
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,460
<i>For many years,</i>

167
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,200
we had heard Barney<i>quote the Bro Code,</i>

168
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,730
<i>a list of do's</i><i> and don'ts for all bros.</i>

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,160
<i>Some were basic.</i>

170
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,330
Bro Code article one:"Bros before hoes.

171
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,700
<i>Some were unbelievably</i><i> complicated.</i>

172
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,030
Bro Code article 89:

173
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,300
"The mom of a bro is always off limits,

174
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,600
"but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it,

175
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,260
"and/or is wearing at least one a article

176
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,130
of leopard print clothing."

177
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
<i>And some were</i><i>just plain disturbing.</i>

178
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,360
Bro Code article 34:

179
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,530
"Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."

180
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,960
Two dudes.

181
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,200
This is not a legal docume..

182
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,530
This is just something you wrote.

183
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
You think I wrote that?

184
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,360
Oh, Marshall,

185
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,930
don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?

186
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,260
<i>The year was 1776.</i>

187
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,230
<i>The place: Philadelphia.</i>

188
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,030
Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.

189
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,960
But, bro, seriously,

190
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,400
I called the dibs on that wench.

191
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,400
You codpiece blocked me.

192
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,600
So what if I did?

193
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,830
There's no rule against it.

194
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,130
Well, there should be.

195
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,130
There should be a set of rules that govern

196
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,600
the way bros comport themselves among other bros.

197
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,630
But who shall write such a document?

198
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,560
I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.

199
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,160
And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.

200
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,900
I shall write this set of rules.

201
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,260
And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution.

202
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,760
 To save paper.

203
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,960
It's resolved!

204
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,660
Barney Stinson shall write...

205
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,700
the Bro Code.

206
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,800
And I shl l include a provision

207
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,960
that stateth no eye contact in a devil's three-way.

208
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,000
-Seconded. -Seconded.

209
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,200
Listen, what do you want me for? 

210
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,730
I've just been losing my mind lately,

211
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,430
and do you know why I feel so bad?

212
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,860
Yeah, because you slept with Robin.

213
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,260
No, that was awesome.

214
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,730
I feel bad

215
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,730
because the Bro Code  clearly states

216
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,660
"No sex with your bro's ex."

217
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,230
But if you,

218
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,030
my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere,

219
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,130
then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.

220
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,860
And you would pay me for that?

221
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,100
No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork.

222
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,000
Technically, you'll be paid  by a toy factory in Pyongyang.

223
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,130
Barney, I'm no shrink, okay,

224
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,600
but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you

225
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,660
to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?

226
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,530
Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation,

227
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,330
I'd hire the guy we pay

228
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,700
to hint notize us before depositions.

229
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,430
Now, get cracking!

230
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,630
<i>While Marshall examined</i>  <i> the Bro Code,</i>

231
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,730
<i>Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.</i>

232
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,660
And with a little luck, in a few days,

233
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,730
Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone.

234
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,360
And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine.

235
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,100
Right, Farmer Frank?

236
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,760
You got it, toots.

237
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,730
Any last questions  for Farmer Frank? Yes.

238
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,560
Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?

239
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,130
Oh! Ah, isn't  that sweet!

240
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,360
Well, you know, honey,

241
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,960
right after this,

242
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop.

243
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,560
 And they're going to take

244
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,730
a great big knife...

245
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,260
<i>And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class</i>

246
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,400
with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from..

247
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,600
So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.

248
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,400
Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.

249
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,130
I know, I know.

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,700
I already called an animal rescue,

251
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,800
and they're going to come get her on Monday.

252
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,060
Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat

253
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,100
and go to the bathroom?!

254
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,900
Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?

255
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,330
I-I guess  I'll keep her up on the roof.

256
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,960
Look, call me crazy. I just...

257
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,860
I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.

258
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,260
And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat

259
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,400
would go on to do in that bathroom was so...

260
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,530
<i>No, you know what?</i>

261
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
<i>I'm m getting ahead of myself.</i>

262
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,130
<i>We'll get there.</i>

263
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,430
Hey, Ted.

264
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,130
   You ready to, um...

265
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,700
Where'd the goat turd come from?

266
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,660
How'd you know  that was a goat turd?

267
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,960
Well, it was either that,

268
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,000
or a musk ox turd,

269
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,460
and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?

270
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,600
Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.

271
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,330
Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.

272
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,500
Talk about what?

273
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,960
Nothing.

274
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,500
How was your day?

275
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,460
Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?

276
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,760
How does everyone know that's a goat turd?

277
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,260
-Barney told you. -I don't know  what you're talking about,madam. 

278
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,330
Marshall,

279
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,330
you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing,

280
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,460
coughing,

281
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,760
and your hands are shaking.

282
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,500
come here.

283
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,330
Ted is never finding out about this, you understand?

284
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,230
Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything.

285
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,900
And don't even think about opening that can

286
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,030
until I'm out of the splash zone.

287
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,260
fantastic, you're here.

288
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,130
Give me the good news.

289
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,760
I'm sorry.

290
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,900
You did too good of a job writing this thing.

291
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,600
It's-it's iron-clad.

292
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,260
No!

293
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,360
Bad lawyer!

294
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,260
I need a loophole!

295
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,160
I want to feel better, Marshall!

296
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,960
I can't keep buying things!

297
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,600
I have six self-cleaning litterboxes

298
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,030
and I don't even have a kid.

299
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,160
Wait. How about this?

300
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,500
Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right?

301
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,430
And if he's broken the Bro Code,

302
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,600
then I'm off the hook.

303
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,760
I thought about that.

304
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,760
And I gotta say,

305
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,160
Ted has upheld this thing time and time again.

306
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,700
For example,  article 87:

307
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,430
"A bro shall at all times say yes."

308
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,860
So he saved you from an avalanche?

309
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,530
Yes.

310
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,130
And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?

311
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,400
Yes.

312
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,860
And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer

313
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,230
who used to be a member of the Russian mob?

314
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,260
Da.

315
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,830
Article 29

316
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,930
"A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro

317
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
to the existence of a girl fight."

318
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,200
Dude, two girls are fighting  at MacLaren's.

319
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,930
What?!

320
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,500
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,100
It was crazy. This one girl was like...

322
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,460
Oh, hey.

323
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,230
Hey.

324
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,600
Article 53:

325
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,960
"A bro will, whenever possible,

326
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,030
provide his bro with protection."

327
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,000
That feels nice.

328
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,000
Good.

329
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,400
I just wish we had some wine.

330
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,730
Yeah.

331
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,160
I wish we had  some wine, too.

332
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,860
damn it, Marshall.

333
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,860
I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is!

334
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,800
You're my lawyer!

335
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,000
The answer is in there! Find it!

336
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it.

337
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,200
The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong.

338
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,530
And the only way you're ever gonna feel

339
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,300
any better about it is  if you tell Ted what you did.

340
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,700
What if he never wants to talk to me again?

341
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,530
Well, I guess that's just a chance

342
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,330
you're gonna have to take.

343
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,460
Which brings us to April 25, 2008.

344
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,230
My 30th birthday,

345
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,930
or as it would come to be referred to in later years:

346
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,630
The Day of the Goat.

347
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,960
Hey, where are you?

348
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,530
I'm in the limo,  right outside ofeded's office.

349
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,830
Great. Well, everyone's here.

350
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,300
Stella just arrived

351
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,630
and there is something here so awesome,

352
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,460
I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...

353
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,500
Goat in a party hat?

354
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,660
Damn it!

355
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, you still gotta see it.

356
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,660
It's so much fun having a goat at a party!

357
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,000
In a few short hours,

358
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,960
Lily would come to regret those words.

359
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,100
But we'll get there.

360
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,860
Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.

361
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay. Bye.

362
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,100
Whoa, you guys went all out.

363
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning!

364
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,260
Everyone get ready!

365
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,460
Oh, Missy, are you excit??

366
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,830
Yes, you are!

367
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,560
Whoa, we're leaving the city.

368
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,630
Where the hell is this party?

369
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,460
Vegas.

370
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,700
Vegas? I thought the party  was on the rooftop.

371
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,430
Surprise!

372
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,900
Just a decoy, my friend.

373
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,430
So there's no roof party?

374
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,630
Oh, no. There is.  We're just not going.

375
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,530
This is how good a friend I am.

376
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,900
They want you to spent your 30th standing around

377
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room.

378
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,330
But not me, bro.

379
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,230
I pulled out all the stops.

380
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,660
Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio.

381
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,300
Steaks at BOA,

382
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,000
scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats

383
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,100
to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with,

384
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,260
wait for it...

385
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,400
a grizzly bear!

386
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,000
Take me home, Barney.

387
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,030
No!

388
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,630
We have to go to Vegas.

389
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,300
Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but...

390
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,660
there's something that I have to tell you,

391
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,430
and I wanted you to be

392
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,300
in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.

393
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,400
You slept with Robin.

394
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,030
Ranjit!

395
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,330
You slept with Robin?

396
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,130
Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!

397
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,200
When did you find out?

398
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,830
Hey, Robin. Come here!

399
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,560
What's up?

400
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,100
I was, uh, just going through some old stuff

401
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,130
-and I... -Oh, crap!

402
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,530
Anyway, uh,

403
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,960
I came across this.

404
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,660
-From my vacacation in Vermont. -Yeah.

405
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,630
I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.

406
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,130
I slept with Barney!

407
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,560
What?

408
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,300
It was just one time,

409
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,560
it, it was the night that Simon dumped me

410
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,300
and I was in a really vulnerable place

411
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,430
and I, I wand d to just pretend like it never happened,

412
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,300
but I couldn't, and...

413
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,030
I can't.

414
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,300
I just, I had to tell you.

415
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,930
And...

416
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,800
I just hope that we can still be friends.

417
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,460
Of course we can still be friends.

418
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,130
So you're not mad?

419
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,830
Well, I'm...

420
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,830
it's a little weird, but, um,

421
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,960
No, I'm not mad.

422
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,660
So you're not mad?

423
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,930
No, I'm not mad.

424
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago.

425
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,330
We've, we've both dated lots of people since then.

426
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,700
I'm with Stella now.

427
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,630
Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.

428
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,860
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.

429
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,700
Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,460
Oh, hey, I just remembered, um,

431
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,530
my mom is coming into town next month.

432
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,960
Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!

433
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,000
Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.

434
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,160
Marshall, can we keep the goat?

435
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,900
No.

436
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,860
-But she's so cute and furry and soft. -Yeah,

437
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,730
and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage

438
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,860
and can't control her bobowels.

439
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,500
Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital

440
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,800
and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?

441
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,530
Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea

442
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,330
after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning

443
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,060
you're going to want this thing out of your house.

444
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,200
Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.

445
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,900
Marshall!

446
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,930
I'm sorry!

447
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,300
I couldn't take it anymore.

448
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,200
I can't believe  you did that.

449
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,800
That's so gross.

450
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,730
Was it amazing?

451
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,430
What? I...

452
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,460
Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.

453
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,500
I know but it's Barney.

454
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,200
It's just hard not to be curious.

455
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,330
Did he have like devices and stuff?

456
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,700
Lily,come on.

457
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,930
-Hot wax? -Stop it.

458
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,930
Did he tie you to anything?

459
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,300
-That's enough.  -What's wrong with you?

460
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,160
I'm sorry.

461
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Is he all smooth down there?

462
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,660
Three billion women on the planet!

463
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,630
Three billion!

464
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year!

465
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,100
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?!

466
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,400
Robin?!

467
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,960
You think I'm proud of this?!

468
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,830
I'm horrified that this happened.

469
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,260
How did it happen? Huh?

470
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,730
Barney, I want to know.

471
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,900
Tell me exactly how it happened.

472
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,760
You mean...

473
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,360
what position?

474
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,330
Okay.

475
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,930
Stop it!

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,260
Stop it!

477
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,760
Stop it.

478
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:22,900
-Hit him! Hit him, -Ted! Stop!

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,360
-Hit him! -Stop!

480
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,300
-Hit him! -Okay.

481
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,800
Okay. Okay.

482
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,130
You're pissed.

483
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,260
You deserve to be.

484
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,300
Fine. You know what?

485
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,300
One free shot. On me.

486
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,900
Anywhere but the face.

487
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,960
Who punches someone in the groin?

488
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,030
Okay.Okay.

489
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,200
I deserved that.

490
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,660
I deserved that.

491
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,700
But what's important now is...

492
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,960
we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?

493
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,960
You think that this is just about Robin?

494
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,600
This is about...

495
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,100
You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff.

496
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,500
I mean some really terrible stuff

497
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,030
to a lot of different people.

498
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,230
I just always thought there had to be a limit.

499
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,460
I always thought I was the limit.

500
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,860
You're always spouting off  these rules for bros.

501
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,100
Isn't one of them, "don't do this"?

502
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,400
Yeah. And I broke it.

503
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,260
I'm sorry.

504
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,760
But, Ted...

505
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,260
...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...

506
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,500
I am not going to Vegas with you!

507
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm not going to blow off my friends

508
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,760
and my girlfriend,

509
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,230
and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club.

510
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,130
The fact that you think I would...

511
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,700
You know, Barney,earlier this week 

512
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,400
I started putting things in a box

513
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,330
and that box was labeled "stuff I have no use for anymore."

514
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,260
What does that mean?

515
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,130
It means...

516
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
maybe you belong in that box.

517
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,130
Are you saying you dnon't want to be bros anymore?

518
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,600
I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.

519
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,600
Okay, I'm going to stop you right there,

520
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,300
because it seems like you're about to say something

521
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,000
that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.

522
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,660
Ranjit, stop the car.

523
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,030
I'm getting a cab.

524
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,000
Surprise!

525
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,130
<i>Oh, right, the goat.</i>

526
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,600
<i>So funny.You're going to love this.</i>

527
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,700
So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom

528
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,600
and was eating one<i>of Robin's washcloths and</i>

529
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,230
<i>wait, hold on.</i>

530
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,160
Robin wasn't living here<i> on my 30th birthday.</i>

531
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,560
<i>When did this happen?</i>

532
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,930
Oh, wait, the goat was there<i> on my 31st birthday.</i>

533
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,760
Sorry,<i>I totally got that wrong.</i>
