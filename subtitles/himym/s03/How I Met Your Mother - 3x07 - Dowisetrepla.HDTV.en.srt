1
00:00:00,757 --> 00:00:03,004
<i>Kids, everybody makes mistakes.</i>

2
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:04,695
<i>Take this girl Meg for instance.</i>

3
00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:06,063
<i>She made a mistake,</i>

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,665
<i>a mistake named Barney.</i>

5
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:11,682
Yeah, I thought I was gonna get
married to my last boyfriend but,

6
00:00:11,903 --> 00:00:14,540
boy, did that guy
have commitment issues.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,209
That whole relationship...

8
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:19,224
that's three weeks of my
life I'll never get back.

9
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:22,161
Well, I love commitment.

10
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,910
I wish I could marry
commitment.

11
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:26,462
- I met a girl last night.
- Really?

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,829
So perky and full of life
and not at all fake.

13
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,277
- You're talking about her boobs, right?
- Sí. ("C")

14
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:35,113
And that wasn't Spanish,
that was cup size. What up?

15
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,771
- So, these boobs...
- Hmm.

16
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:41,451
- paint me a word picture.
- All right, Ted.

17
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:44,460
Imagine the heads
of two Irish babies.

18
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:48,740
- Let's call them... and...
- Please stop!

19
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>When you get married, you start
outgrowing certain parts of your life.</i>

20
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:55,843
<i>And for Lily and Marshall,
those certain parts were,</i>

21
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:57,741
<i>for the most part, me.</i>

22
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,111
Why would you come in?
You heard me shaving!

23
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:05,002
I thought you were
shaving your face!

24
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:07,183
Well, clearly I wasn't!

25
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:12,041
Pay up! Hussy!

26
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:14,650
Guys. Guys,
it's 3:00 in the morning

27
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:16,140
and it reeks in here.

28
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:17,612
Ted said it was okay.

29
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,851
Ah, hey, Marshall.
You're still up?

30
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:21,861
Aren't you taking the bar
tomorrow?

31
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:25,543
<i>Discontent was bubbling
under the surface,</i>

32
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:26,760
<i>until one day...</i>

33
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:27,810
Ted!

34
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,343
How many times
have I asked you to put the lid

35
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:32,051
back on the peanut butter jar?

36
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:36,302
It's this sort of inconsiderate,
immature jackassery

37
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:39,143
that makes me feel like I'm living
in the Real World house,

38
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,403
and not the early years
when they all had jobs

39
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:45,300
and social consciences.
I'm talking about Hawaii and after!

40
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:49,762
I can't take this anymore!
Ted, Lily and I are married now!

41
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:51,012
It's time!

42
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,163
We're getting our own place!

43
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:57,141
Actually, I left the lid off.
Sorry, baby.

44
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,441
<i>But still, it was time
to move forward.</i>

45
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01,752
<i>So, they set out to find
a new apartment to rent.</i>

46
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:03,262
Hey, here's one.

47
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:05,623
Pre-war building,
recently renovated,

48
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,723
hardwood floors,
tons of light,

49
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,423
two bedroom, two bath.

50
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:12,592
Oh, yeah, but that one's not
for rent. It's for sale.

51
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:16,993
<i>Kids, Uncle Marshall
always likes to say</i>

52
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:19,002
<i>that he had made three big
mistakes in his life.</i>

53
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:22,130
<i>- This was the first.
- Jump, you big chicken!</i>

54
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:24,500
<i>- Jump ! You afraidy cat!
- Jump!</i>

55
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,372
<i>This was the second.</i>

56
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,601
<i>And this was the third
and biggest.</i>

57
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:33,651
- We should buy a place!
- What?

58
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:36,510
Baby, real estate is always
a good investment.

59
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:37,350
<i>It's not.</i>

60
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:39,663
And the market is really hot
right now.

61
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:40,473
<i>It wasn't.</i>

62
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:44,263
And because of my new job, we are
in such a strong place financially.

63
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,153
<i>They weren't.</i>

64
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,891
<i>Because Lily had a secret...</i>

65
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:51,251
Hi. My name is Lily
and I'm a shopaholic.

66
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,003
Hi, Lily.

67
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:57,523
Oh, you guys don't do that here?
Sorry. Proceed.

68
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:02,870
I buy designer clothes
and accessories that I can't afford.

69
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:06,270
I have 15 credit cards,
and they're all maxed out.

70
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:10,492
And no one outside of this room,
not even my husband, knows.

71
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:14,120
And I, I feel terrible because
all I want to do right now

72
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:17,553
is ask you where you got those shoes.
They're adorable.

73
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,403
We can't buy, we have debt.

74
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,833
Yeah, I know,
my student loans are pretty big.

75
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:24,301
I forgive you.

76
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:25,250
What?

77
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,961
Well... I'm just saying
as your wife,

78
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:31,463
you know, I'm cool that you spent
tens of thousands of dollars

79
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,322
on a brand name law school.

80
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:37,033
Because I know it makes you feel
good and pretty.

81
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,592
Let's just go take a look
at this place.

82
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:41,721
Where is it?

83
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:45,111
Uh, it's in a
neighborhood called...

84
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:48,613
Dowisetrepla?

85
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,742
<i>Dowisetrepla.</i>

86
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:53,771
Oh, I see, you're
not New Yorkers.

87
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,482
Oh, actually we live
on the Upper West Side, so...

88
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:57,720
No need to be embarrassed,
listen, here in New York

89
00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,890
we just shorten the names
of all the neighborhoods,

90
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,393
SoHo, TriBeCa, Nolita...

91
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:05,042
Oh, right. Dowisetrepla.

92
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,781
No, I'm,
I'm from New York.

93
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,882
I know this neighborhood.
I'm down with D-town.

94
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:12,163
Oh, well,
nobody calls it D-town.

95
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:15,132
Dowisetrepla is
the up-and-coming neighborhood.

96
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,871
And I have to tell you,
for these prices,

97
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,420
you're not going to be able
to find another...

98
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:20,903
I'm, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

99
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:22,510
Don't bother
with the hard sell.

100
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,950
This place is, is way
out of our price range,

101
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,761
and besides, we've only
just started to looking.

102
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:28,303
<i>Is what Marshall
should have said.</i>

103
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,021
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

104
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:32,950
I love it!
Let's get it!

105
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,550
How I Met Your Mother 3x07
<i>- Dowisetrepla -</i>

106
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,573
<i>Thank you, guys,
for coming down here so quickly.</i>

107
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,132
I've never been to
this neighborhood.

108
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,853
Kind of thought this part
of town was water.

109
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:56,900
No, dude.
This is Dowisetrepla.

110
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,023
Dowisetrepla?

112
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:00,711
Is that an abbreviation
for something?

114
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:03,522
He's from Ohio.

116
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:07,683
Dowisetrepla is
the up-and-coming neighborhood.

117
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:10,991
I think this might be the place
where Lily and I start a family.

118
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:13,112
I can see it now.

119
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,361
Two, three, four.

120
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,161
All right, bring it home, boys.

121
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:25,203
Sounds great, boys.

122
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:27,241
Who wants chocolate pancakes?

123
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:29,333
Thanks, Mommy!

124
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:34,390
Man,
life is gonna be sweet!

125
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,641
Oh, my God, Lily, have
you seen this kitchen?

126
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:40,420
I know.
Isn't it amazing?

127
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:43,021
- I just love it so...
- What the hell are you doing?

128
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:44,430
You can't buy this place.

129
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,913
Lily, you have a debt
the size of Mount Waddington!

130
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:48,110
Waddington?

131
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:51,460
It's the tallest mountain in Canada.
It's like 4,000 meters high.

132
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:52,291
Meters?

133
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:55,451
Don't let Marshall
fall in love with this apartment.

134
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:58,603
I know, I know, I know,
but what do I tell him?

135
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,070
I don't know, tell him, um,
tell him you saw a ghost.

136
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:01,962
Tell him it's haunted.

137
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:04,153
You really don't know
Marshall at all.

138
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,562
So, uh, the owners,
where are they?

139
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:12,183
They're on vacation in France
for two of weeks.

140
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,191
I see.

141
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:16,883
Between you and me,
I'm also interested in the apartment.

142
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:19,652
So is there any way I could
come back later

143
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:21,760
and check it out while
you're showing them other places?

144
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,442
The lockbox
combination is 1421.

145
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,189
And here is my card.

146
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,007
Are you serious?

147
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,220
You're trying to snake this apartment
away from Marshall and Lily?

148
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:36,411
Ted, do you think I have
no morals whatsoever?

149
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:39,672
I simply want to fool a girl into
thinking this is my apartment

150
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:42,030
so I can nail her once and
never have to see her again.

151
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:43,093
I'm not a monster.

152
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,362
Now, listen, I don't want to put
a lot of pressure on you,

153
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:49,580
but there is one other couple that's
expressed very serious interest.

154
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,603
I see what
you're doing here.

155
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:54,652
"Another couple."
Please.

156
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:57,601
That crap is page one
out of the Realtor's playbook.

157
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:58,723
And we're not buying it.

158
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,233
<i>Is what Marshall
should have said.</i>

159
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,701
Another couple? No!

160
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:05,642
We want it. Sell it to us.
We'll give you so much more money.

161
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:08,241
Oh, Marshall,
can I talk to you?

162
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,122
Marshall, I just...

163
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,551
I don't know if now is
the right time to buy.

164
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,112
But we're not doing this for now,
we're doing this for our future.

165
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,950
Can't you imagine
starting a family here?

166
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,581
Oh, Persephone!
Oh, Daphne!

167
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:27,111
These'll be a perfect additions

168
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:29,910
to our upcoming mother-daughter
exhibit at the Met.

169
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:33,903
Looks great, girls.

170
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:35,932
Who wants crêpes au chocolat?

171
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,583
Merci, papa!

172
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:41,620
So... what do you guys think?

173
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,361
I love it, but Marshall,

174
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:48,592
I should have told you this
a long time ago.

175
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:52,012
We can't afford to buy
an apartment because...

176
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,193
I have too much credit
card debt.

177
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,761
I am so sorry.

178
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,222
<i>Is what she should have said.</i>

179
00:07:57,857 --> 00:07:59,503
I love it. Let's get it.

180
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,193
Can we charge it?

181
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:05,911
To Lily and Marshall and their
momentous step forward into adulthood.

182
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,900
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

183
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:12,080
Drink it! Yes! Well done.
Nice! Yeah!

184
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:14,370
- Anything else?
- Yes.

185
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,223
I've been staring at
that thing for years.

186
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,273
Wendy, bring me the comically large
bottle of champagne.

187
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:27,042
Really? Are you sure?
It's never been refrigerated.

188
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:29,200
And I think at some point there
was a fish in it.

189
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,672
Honey, once you've
made the sale, stop sellin'.

190
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,691
All right, but you guys
have to help me carry it.

191
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,432
All right,
let's do it.

192
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:38,732
Let's do this.

193
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,880
I know what you're thinking.
I should tell Marshall the truth.

194
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,613
Hey, I've got the whole thing
figured out.

195
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,631
We'll apply for the loan
under Marshall's name,

196
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,261
and he'll never need to know.

197
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,382
And then in the meantime,
I'll slowly work down my debt.

198
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,162
Right after I furnish
the apartment.

199
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:56,282
I saw this amazing
leather sofa today.

200
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,462
You should be a reality show.

201
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:01,531
Nice! Nice.

202
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,742
Wait! That cork is the size
of a softball

203
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:08,632
and you're pointing it directly
at Wendy the waitress's face.

204
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:09,993
<i>Is what he should have said.</i>

205
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,012
<i>Now if you thinking of
buying an appartment,</i>

206
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,073
<i>it's always good to check
the place out at night.</i>

207
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,662
Welcome to my humble abode.

208
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,083
This place is so nice.

209
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:23,712
Ah, make yourself at home.
Please, get comfortable.

210
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:25,712
If you see something you like,
just take it.

211
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,683
- Who are these people?
- Uh... that's my parents.

212
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,320
They're... Asian.

213
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,922
Yeah. They're a Chinese couple
that wanted a white baby.

214
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:38,091
It works both ways.

215
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:40,982
- Cookie.
- Wow.

216
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,831
- Did you make those?
- You got me.

217
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,492
My sisters taught me how to bake
and how to listen.

218
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,091
I feel so at home here.

219
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,190
I'm glad.

220
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:53,580
Sometimes, I don't.

221
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,370
A place like this really
needs a lady of the house.

222
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:59,011
I know it's early
to be thinking of you as...

223
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,012
Oh, God, I'm freaking you
out, aren't I? It's just...

224
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:04,621
you make me feel so safe...
I didn't...

225
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:10,461
<i>The next day, Lily and Marshall went
to the mortgage broker to get a loan.</i>

226
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:12,192
Hey, uh, can we get this
in singles?

227
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,190
Before we get the apartment I
want to put in a kiddie pool

228
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:15,472
and swim around in it naked.

229
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:19,362
- Great, that is great!
- Thank you.

230
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:22,843
- Thank you.
- Okay, all right, back to business.

231
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:27,082
All right, Mrs. Aldrin,
I'm going to need your social as well.

232
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,441
What? Why? I mean, you already
have Marshall's.

233
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,260
Yes, but since you're
a married couple,

234
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,592
you'll be applying for
a joint loan, so...

235
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:38,671
Well, can we just go ahead
and do it in my husband's name?

236
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,512
He's the head
of the household.

237
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,053
He earns the big bucks. I mean,
can women even own property?

238
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,162
Go ahead, just give
him your social.

239
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:50,470
Okay, my...
my social is, uh...

240
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:52,622
5 5 1 2 4 1 8 0

241
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:53,751
Got it.

242
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,691
Let's see what kind of rate
I can get you two.

243
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:01,682
Under six percent. Under six percent.
Under six percent, please.

244
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,592
There we go.
Congratulations.

245
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,602
You have been
approved for a loan at 18%.

246
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,053
No, way. That-that
can't be right.

247
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,812
You're lucky to be
getting a mortgage.

248
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,283
Let's get out
of here, Marshall.

249
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:16,483
Hold it, I-I don't understand.

250
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,222
Did we do something
wrong or...?

251
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,112
You have quite a bit of debt.

252
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:22,641
My student loans.
Great.

253
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:23,770
I thought we were friends.

254
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,670
You know what, it's fine
to penalize me

255
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,722
for trying to get an education
and build a career,

256
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,780
but I will not let you
deprive my beautiful wife

257
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,303
of her dream home just because I...

258
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:34,232
Okay, actually, it's because
of your wife's credit card debt.

259
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:41,051
Oh, my God.

260
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:46,193
Marshall, there's something
I have to tell you,

261
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,412
and I want you to hear it
from me first.

262
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,652
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

263
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:59,520
You just snuck this girl
into some stranger's apartment?

264
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:00,843
Yeah, we spent the night.

265
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:05,312
- Hey, look at you.
- Hey.

266
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,691
I'm wearing your bathrobe.

267
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,790
I hope you don't mind.

268
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:12,513
The only thing missing from
that bathrobe are your initials.

269
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,752
My mom's gonna be
in town next week.

270
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:20,491
Is it okay if
she stays with us?

271
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:25,112
Only if she sleeps in the bed
and I sleep on the couch.

272
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:28,430
- You're so sweet.
- I love you.

273
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,731
There, I said it
and I'm not taking it back.

274
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:34,501
Oh, my God!
I love you, too.

275
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm finally not
the first one to say it!

276
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:42,203
How about you get in the shower,
and I will make us some waffles.

277
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:00,101
Works every time.

278
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,281
Wait. That time that you
offered to walk my dogs

279
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:05,190
when I went to visit
my dad in Vancouver...

280
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,043
Yup.

281
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:09,721
Is that why my Yorkie trembled
for like a week after I got back?

282
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:13,090
Yeah. That little guy saw some
stuff I'm not proud of.

283
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,393
What ?

284
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,271
There was a fight here.

285
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:20,281
What do you mean?

286
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,221
Whenever Marshall and Lily have
a big argument,

287
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,031
they always leave a trail of evidence
all over the apartment.

288
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:28,863
Oh, God, here we go.
He had a detective club as a kid.

289
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:32,322
Uh, the Mosby Boys
cracked a lot of big cases.

290
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:35,530
The Mosby Boys?
You mean you and your sister.

291
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,412
We solved the mystery
of the missing retainer.

292
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:41,142
Hmm, let me guess:
it was in the garbage.

293
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:43,072
Why are you like this?

294
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:45,643
Anyway, this is serious.

295
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,063
I know Lily and Marshall.

296
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,823
All the telltale signs
are here.

297
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:50,322
Like this.

298
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:53,603
- A water bottle?
- Don't touch the evidence!

299
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:54,853
I got your back, partner.

300
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,630
It's not just any water bottle.

301
00:13:58,077 --> 00:14:00,390
Notice the label is peeled off.

302
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,430
<i>Lily always peels labels off
the bottle when she's feeling guilty.</i>

303
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:07,162
<i>This label is not
only peeled off...</i>

304
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:08,802
<i>but torn up.</i>

305
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:13,580
Oh, man, she must have
done something bad.

306
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:16,383
Which means Marshall
must have been really angry,

307
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,242
and when Marshall gets
really angry...

308
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:20,293
he eats.

309
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:29,402
Just as I suspected,

310
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,213
Cherry Garcia.

311
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:34,652
Given the liquid consistency,

312
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:37,643
I place the fight between...

313
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:39,933
noon and 1:00.

314
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:42,233
Ew, that was on the floor.

315
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:43,662
If you want to get to
the bottom of this,

316
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:46,193
you're gonna need a stronger stomach
than that, doll-face.

317
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:47,702
Marshall stood here.

318
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:51,243
<i>Eating and yelling,
yelling and eating.</i>

319
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,970
<i>Lily stood here.</i>

320
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:56,890
- Crying.
- Ew, Ted.

321
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:00,090
And then Marshall tried
to storm out...

322
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:04,252
but Lily...
went for the Hail Mary pass.

323
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:08,813
Which would mean...

324
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:15,623
What do you think,
makeup sex?

325
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,950
No. There'd be bigger mess.

326
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:20,221
Tempted as he was,
Marshall was still too upset.

327
00:15:20,656 --> 00:15:22,681
<i>He had to get out of here,
any way he could.</i>

328
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,631
<i>He chose the door,
slamming it behind him.</i>

329
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:28,922
Which is why this picture
is crooked.

330
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:30,613
Nice catch, rook.

331
00:15:30,718 --> 00:15:33,361
I'll just, uh, take
this down to the lab.

332
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,283
Now all we need is a motive.

333
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:38,962
The million-dollar question.

334
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,361
What were they fighting about?

335
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:41,401
I know what they've
been fighting...

336
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:42,580
Bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup, bup.

337
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:45,241
There's only one possible
conclusion.

338
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:48,230
Lily and Marshall
were fighting about...

339
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:50,640
peanut butter.

340
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,050
Lily left the lid off...

341
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:56,631
then Marshall blew his.

342
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,902
I know what they were fighting about,
and it wasn't peanut butter.

343
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:03,221
- Robin, just...
- I appreciate your help,

344
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,820
but there's a reason your
name is Robin, not Batman.

345
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:06,683
Just...

346
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,981
They were fighting because they didn't
get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.

347
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:12,173
- Robin, just...
- What?

348
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,961
Yeah, she has a pile of debt
the size of Mount... Rushmore.

349
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:19,552
Nice try, Robin.
So, the next thing Lily did

350
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:23,393
was give Marshall a few hours
to cool off about the peanut butter.

351
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,802
Then she called him
to apologize,

352
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,290
which is why
the last number dialed... is...

353
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:31,430
<i>Greenstein and Lee,
Divorce Attorneys.</i>

354
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:37,501
- This can't be happening.
- They can't... get divorced.

355
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,470
Not Lily and Marshall, no way.

356
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,223
Well, it's been nice
knowing you guys.

357
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:42,670
- What do you mean?
- Well...

358
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,180
Marshall's gonna get you guys,
Lily's gonna get me.

359
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,852
Even if they did break up, that doesn't
mean we can't all still hang out.

360
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:50,602
I mean we broke up and we still
hang out. It's not weird.

361
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:54,580
- It's a little weird.
- Yeah, it is. It's weird.

362
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:59,973
The world needs
Marshall and Lily... together.

363
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:05,203
I'm not crying,
there's something in my eye.

364
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,041
They're back.

365
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,853
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Hey.

366
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:14,753
We have an announcement.

367
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,083
I know, it's a terrible idea.
You can't do it!

368
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,250
Just look at me.

369
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:26,581
I hit redial on the phone.
Divorce lawyers?

370
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,523
Oh, I should explain.

371
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:33,251
- We got in a pretty big fight.
- Yeah, I know.

372
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:37,413
- Marshall stormed out.
- I went, uh, to the bar.

373
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:41,280
Still drinking that?

374
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:45,793
I paid for it. And apparently
money's tight now, so...

375
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,820
Listen, I've been
thinking about this, and,

376
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:53,810
I know there's no way to undo
what I've done, but, well,

377
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:55,901
I made an appointment
with a divorce lawyer.

378
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:56,923
What?! What?!

379
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:58,171
Oh, no, no, no, no-no.

380
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,851
- What, you want a divorce now?
- No. I just mean on paper,

381
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:04,702
so that you can buy the apartment
without my bad credit dragging us down.

382
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:07,623
Lily... are you trying
to kill me?

383
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,482
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have led
with the divorce lawyer part.

384
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,761
No, you shouldn't have.

385
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:15,931
I love you, Lily.

386
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:17,590
I love you, too.

387
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,463
And I want us
to have our dream home.

388
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:24,861
Well, I don't know.
It seems like this is a way to do it.

389
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:30,290
So... Marshall Eriksen,
will you divorce me?

390
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:34,342
That's the sweetest divorce
proposal I've ever heard.

391
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:37,821
So is that a yes? You can't sleep
with other women though.

392
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:41,992
No, we're not getting divorced,
not even on paper.

393
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:45,072
When I married you, I
married your problems, too.

394
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:48,613
The ones I knew about
and the ones I didn't.

395
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,193
That was the deal.
We'll figure this out together.

396
00:18:56,556 --> 00:18:58,183
Can I get you guys
anything else?

397
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:02,513
So you're not
getting a divorce?

398
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:04,431
- No.
- Wow, you guys scared us.

399
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:06,662
Oh, thank God.

400
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,990
'Cause, I mean if you did, then,

401
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,713
who'd be the lame married couple
I get to make fun of?

402
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,581
Like, "Hey, Marshall,
you married Miss Right.

403
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,700
You just didn't know her
first name was Always."

404
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:18,572
That stuff is gold.

405
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:22,960
So, what's the announcement?

406
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:25,650
I just got off the phone
with the Realtor.

407
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,403
We told her that, uh,
because of our finances,

408
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:31,072
we're not getting the place.
It's just... it's not the right time.

409
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:32,732
<i>Is what Marshall
should have said.</i>

410
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,333
I just got off the phone
with the realtor.

411
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,530
- We got the place!
- We're homeowners!

412
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,711
- Are you insane?
- Have you lost your mind?

413
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:42,060
<i>Is what we should have said.</i>

414
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:46,291
- Yes! Congratulations!
- That's awesome!

415
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:49,341
- Thank you.
- Wow! Wow!

416
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:52,502
This is exciting!

417
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah. There it is!
Our new home.

418
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:59,410
- Shall we?
- We shall.

419
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:06,190
Oh, what a horrible smell.

420
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:07,441
It reeks.

421
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:08,663
Oh, that's just the plant.

422
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:10,860
Don't worry, they shut it
down on the weekends.

423
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:13,682
Wh-What plant?
What are you talking about?

424
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:14,840
Don't you know?

425
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:18,003
Baby, this whole neighborhood is
downwind of the sewage treatment plant.

426
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:20,511
Wait...

427
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,720
What did you just say?

428
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:27,492
I said, we're downwind
of the sewage treatment plant.
