1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,510
<i>Kids, back on the falls of 2007</i>

2
00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:04,142
<i>I was dating the girl named...</i>

3
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:05,756
<i>Oh God, what was her name?</i>

4
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:08,348
<i>It's been 23 years,
I can't remember all this stuff.</i>

5
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:10,157
<i>For the sake of the story,
let's call her...</i>

6
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:11,553
Everyone, this is Blahblah.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,227
Please, call me Blah.

8
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:16,473
So, Blah, how did you two meet?

9
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:19,053
Well, I was taking this
cooking class,

10
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:21,930
French Fusion, and everyone
already had a partner,

11
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,592
but then I looked up
and across a crowded room,

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,909
I saw Ted. It was magical.

13
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,197
It was so magical.

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:31,243
<i>Except it wasn't.</i>

15
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:34,691
She's going to tell some bogus
story about a cooking class

16
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:37,063
because she's embarrassed
we met online.

17
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:39,220
- Ai Chihuahua!
- What?

18
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:41,031
What? There's no stigma anymore.

19
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:42,010
Oh, there's a stigma.

20
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:44,570
That's why people always say,
"There's no stigma anymore."

21
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:46,953
- So, she's hot?
- Oh, she's gorgeous.

22
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:48,230
Then she's crazy.

23
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,212
No, she's not.

24
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:53,290
Ted, the only hot girls that troll
the Internet for dudes are crazy,

25
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:55,113
hookers, or dudes.

26
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:59,030
Okay, she's not crazy.
She's not a hooker. She's not a dude.

27
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:01,843
There's this guy I pass on my way
to work every day who's all three...

28
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,053
scares the crap out of me.

29
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,812
There is no way she is above
the line on the Hot/Crazy scale.

30
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,611
She's not even on
the Hot/Crazy scale.

31
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,763
She's just hot.

32
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:11,453
Wait. "Hot/Crazy scale"?

33
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:12,643
Let me illustrate.

34
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:15,610
A girl is allowed to be crazy

35
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:18,150
as long as she is equally hot.

36
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,781
Thus, if she's this crazy,
she has to be this hot.

37
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:26,203
If she's this crazy,
she has to be this hot.

38
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:29,672
You want a girl
to be above this line,

39
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:32,390
also known
as the Vickie Mendoza Diagonal.

40
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:35,360
This girl I dated, she played
jump rope with that line.

41
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,880
She'd shave her head,
then lose ten pounds.

42
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:41,053
She'd stab me with a fork,
then get a boob job.

43
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,132
I should give her a call.

44
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:47,450
How I Met Your Mother 3x5
<i>- How I Met Everyone Else -</i>

45
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:59,572
Okay, so please, just play along
with her fake story.

46
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,262
We met in a cooking class.

47
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,291
I don't know, Ted.

48
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,080
I don't know if I can
just play along

49
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:06,360
with your crazy girlfriend's
fake story.

50
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:08,372
Now, if you had said
fake breasts...

52
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,383
She's not crazy.

54
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,483
Okay. We'll see.

56
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:16,211
Long story short, thank goodness
I'm such a bad cook,

57
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:18,010
or I never would have met Ted.

58
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:22,400
Oh, crazy how cute that is.
It's crazy.

59
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:25,560
You know who else has a really
cute story of how they met?

60
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:28,151
Marshal and Lily. You guys should
tell that story, right now.

61
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:31,960
All right. But spoiler alert.
It ends with everyone saying, "Aw!"

62
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:34,342
- Aw.
- Starts with it, too.

63
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:37,512
<i>When you've been a couple
as long as Marshal and Lily,</i>

64
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:40,720
<i>telling the how-we-met story
becomes a choreographed dance.</i>

65
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:43,302
It was late August, 1996.

66
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:45,603
Lily and I were both
freshman moving into...

67
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,051
- Hewitt Hall.
- Hewitt Hall.

68
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:49,571
<i>And she needed some help
setting up her stereo.</i>

69
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>For some unknown reason,
I felt drawn to room 110.</i>

70
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:58,962
<i>As if she knew that someone
very special was behind that door.</i>

71
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:01,453
<i>And as fate would have it...</i>

72
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:03,143
<i>...that someone...</i>

73
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,841
<i>...was Marshall.</i>

74
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,862
<i>- It was love at first sight.
- It was love at first sight.</i>

75
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:12,892
- Aw...
- I know, right?

77
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:16,032
<i>Now, they perfected that story
over hundreds of tellings.</i>

78
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,843
<i>The first time Marshall
told it to me,</i>

79
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,092
<i>it was a little different.</i>

80
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:21,782
Dude, this black-haired
Goth chick stopped by today.

81
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,890
Want to tap it.

82
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:27,761
You guys are so lucky.

83
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,383
You know, when Ted and I
were cooking

84
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,262
and our hands touched
for the first time,

85
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:34,061
I knew right then that after class
he would take me up on the roof,

86
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:36,033
kiss me and give me a rose.

87
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:37,883
Which he did!

88
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:42,423
- Say, "Aw."
- Aw.

89
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:44,162
I know, right?

90
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,450
I'll get the next round,
okay, guys?

91
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:53,992
Anybody would be stressed out
meeting new people.

92
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,622
She's not crazy.

93
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,663
Crazy-generous maybe,
buying us drinks.

94
00:03:59,005 --> 00:03:59,981
Shut up.

95
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,820
So we know how Marshal
and Lily met.

96
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,341
Robin, how did you and Barney meet?

97
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:12,482
No... 
No, no, no, no.

98
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:16,201
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

99
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:19,120
No. Barney and I
are not together. No.

100
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,293
No.

101
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,542
Really? 16 no's?
Really?

102
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:26,781
- So you're... single?
- Yeah.

103
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:31,173
Oh. So, pretty and, single and,
friends with Ted.

104
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:32,472
Great.

105
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,622
You know who else is friends
with Ted? Marshall.

106
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,870
How did we meet? It was a good story.
I'm going to tell it, right now.

107
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:42,370
Uh, it was the first
day of college.

108
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:44,973
<i>Kids, to understand this story,
you need to know</i>

109
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:48,642
<i>that your Uncle Marshall was doing
something that lots of college kids do.</i>

110
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,060
<i>How do I say this?</i>

111
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:52,341
<i>He was, uh...</i>

112
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:54,281
<i>let's say, eating a sandwich.</i>

113
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:01,103
Dude, I heard the dean is coming.
Put out your sandwich.

114
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,551
Good afternoon, sir.

115
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:14,963
- I'm Marshall Erickson.
- "Sir"?

116
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:17,190
No, please, just call me Ted.

117
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,240
Okay,

118
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:19,720
Dean Ted.

119
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,782
Someone's been eating a sandwich.

120
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,460
What? No. Really?

121
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:29,950
I don't know 'cause I don't even
know what sandwiches smell like.

122
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,623
My parents are going to donate
a lot of money to this school.

123
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,750
So you're bottom bunk;
that's cool.

124
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:38,860
I wanted the top bunk anyway.

125
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,270
What do you mean?

126
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,510
I'm you're new roommate.

127
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:45,901
So unfair.

128
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:49,660
I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean
until later that night.

129
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:57,490
You're not the dean.

130
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:01,513
College... good times.

131
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:03,991
Oh, I get it. Ted told you
I didn't go to college,

132
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:06,642
so now you're giving me a cute,
little backhanded slap.

133
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,421
Oh, here we go.

134
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:12,601
Well, while you were busy majoring
in being freakin' beautiful,

135
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,811
I was starting
my own line of handbags.

136
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:17,590
Your own line of handbags?
That's crazy.

137
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,323
These have sold in Japan. Robin,
have you ever sold anything in Japan?

138
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:25,363
Uh, no. But I would love
to buy one of them, if...

139
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:26,661
Where can I get one?

140
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:29,670
I don't have a distributor here yet,
but than for rubbing that in.

141
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,190
Why are you trying
to undermine me in front of Ted?

142
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:35,302
Look, there's nothing going on
between me and Ted.

143
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,730
Wow, that just...
came out of nowhere.

144
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,492
No, I'm just saying that you
have nothing to worry about.

145
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,519
I wasn't worried.
Are you saying I should be?

146
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,277
No, I'm saying
that you shouldn't be.

147
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,402
Oh, good, 'cause I'm not.
Now, Robin, can you just let it go?

148
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,640
You're making all of us
really uncomfortable.

149
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:51,783
You know what else is
a good story?

150
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,103
How Barney and I met.
Barney, tell that story,

151
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,661
right now, please.

152
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:57,572
Okay, Ted.

153
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:59,870
This is a crazy story.
You're going to love it.

154
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,291
Tonight's the first time I'm taking my
deaf brother out

155
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,002
since our mom died.

156
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,131
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- No, that's okay.

157
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,453
I have to take care
of him now.

158
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,150
Of course,

159
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:15,860
I have had to put my dreams
on hold in order to do it, but...

160
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,003
I'm happy to.

161
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,093
He's my brother
and I love him.

162
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,623
I'm sorry,
it's all still so fresh.

163
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:27,731
Well, man, I'm, uh...
I'm really sorry.

164
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,053
Wow, you bought that?

165
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:32,472
What?

166
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,410
I just made that up
in mid-pee.

167
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,031
If it worked on you,
it's definitely going to work

168
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,982
on the blonde chick
at the end of the bar.

169
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,670
Unless you're a total idiot.
What's your name?

170
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,513
- Ted.
- Are you a total idiot, Ted?

171
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,913
Well, I'm still having
this conversation, so...

172
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:48,113
Well played.

173
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:51,543
I like you, Ted.

174
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,212
Ted, I'm going to teach
you how to live.

175
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,051
Barney.
We met at the urinal.

176
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,472
- Oh, right. Hi.
- Lesson one:

177
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:02,830
Lose the goatee;
it doesn't go with your suit.

178
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:03,993
I'm not wearing a suit.

179
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:05,320
Lesson two: Get a suit.

180
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,642
Suits are cool...
Exhibit A.

181
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:11,650
Lesson three: Don't even think about
getting married until you're 30.

182
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,121
And lesson four:

183
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:14,971
Be totally silent for
the next five minutes.

184
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,233
Hey, Audrey.

185
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,681
Uh, this is
my deaf brother, Edward.

186
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:20,570
Edward!

187
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,320
This is Audrey!

188
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:27,283
You know, I actually know
some sign language.

189
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:32,123
<i>"Hi, my name is Audrey."</i>

190
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:33,871
<i>"Nice to meet you."</i>

191
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:35,583
He doesn't sign.

192
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,990
He's embarrassed by his hands.

193
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:39,701
They're tiny...
and lady-like.

194
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,143
<i>"I'm Edward."</i>

195
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,793
<i>"Nice to meet you to."</i>

196
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:47,731
What? You...
are over your hand issues.

197
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,100
It's about time.

198
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:53,640
<i>"My brother's a great guy."</i>

199
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,642
<i>"You shoul give him
your phone number."</i>

200
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,703
Here. Call me.

201
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,723
And even though that girl ended
up giving me a fake number,

202
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:13,191
I knew that Ted and I would be
each others wingmen forever.

203
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,503
Barney, it's
time you knew, um.

204
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:17,393
That story actually goes
a little bit differently.

205
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,270
<i>"He's lying to you."</i>

206
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,710
<i>"Just give him a fake number."</i>

207
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:27,851
Great. Funny.

208
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,700
God, with a wingman like Ted,
I might need to resort to

209
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:33,331
meeting someone in a super,
desperate and lame way,

210
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,872
like online.

211
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:38,773
Online.

212
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:43,162
- Online.
- Oh, my God! You told them?!

213
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:46,023
Okay, yes, I told them.
But it's not a big deal.

214
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,220
Lots of people meet
on the Internet.

215
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:50,562
That whole scene, a stranger
across a crowded room thing...

216
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:51,780
that only happens in the movies.

217
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:53,232
Yeah, that never happens.

218
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:56,011
Oh, wait, except you and Robin.
That's how you guys met, right?

219
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,082
Wait,

220
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:04,860
you guys dated?

221
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,292
- For how long?
- A year.

222
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:11,233
But don't worry.
The relationship wasn't that good.

223
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,040
By the end,
it was mostly about sex.

224
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,992
Which was not that good.

225
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:18,891
But I was the problem.
I'd just lie there.

226
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:20,962
Ted is, uh, very good.

227
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:23,952
I'm sure he will get you
where you need to go.

228
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,092
Can I buy your bags online?

229
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,252
Oh, oh, I see what's
going on here, Ted.

230
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:33,222
I'm just some random girl
to make Robin jealous,

231
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,342
and after she takes you back,

232
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,942
you probably won't
even remember my name.

233
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:38,501
Come on, Blahblah,
it's not like that.

234
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,331
Well, we're closing in
on the half.

235
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,562
Let's see how Blahblah is doing
on the Crazy/Hot scale.

236
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:48,212
She started the night here,
but as the night's progressed,

237
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:50,743
she's gotten crazier
but no hotter,

238
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:54,180
which has caused her to drift
across the Mendoza Diagonal

239
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:57,773
and dangerously close
to the Shelly Gilespie Zone.

240
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,281
Another girl I dated...

241
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,662
she gained 20 pounds and tried
to kill me with a brick.

242
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,181
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

243
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,312
but seriously, there's nothing
going on with me and Robin.

244
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,830
Then why has she been trying
to undermine me all night?

245
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:11,461
I mean, look at her.
She's laughing at me right now.

246
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,071
I'm sorry, it's just...

247
00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:19,753
you know, Lily and Marshall's story
is so romantic.

248
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:22,103
I just wish we had
something like that.

249
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,570
Well, their story's not
as magical as it seems.

250
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:25,980
What do you mean?

251
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:29,183
No, I, I can't, it's,
it's kind of a secret.

252
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,502
Well how about I tell you a little secret

253
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,002
about what you
might get to do later tonight?

254
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:43,053
The night before Lily met Marshall
there was this party.

255
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:51,190
You a freshwoman?

256
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:53,692
I never use the word "freshman."
Sexist.

257
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,263
Yeah, I'm a first year.
I'm in Hewitt 220.

258
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:00,861
No way. Hewitt 110.
You should totally come by.

259
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:03,520
Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.

260
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:09,182
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

261
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,353
Look at these drunk idiots.

262
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,343
Hey, don't drink
their two dollar beer.

263
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,071
This is a pinot noir.

264
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:20,550
From Europe.

265
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,961
- Oh, it's fruity.
- Yeah,

266
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,343
I cut it with some cranberry juice.
It was pretty strong.

267
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,173
So, uh...
do you have a girlfriend?

268
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,230
Yeah.

269
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,182
Not sure about the whole
"long distance" thing, though.

270
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,493
It's like Descartes says.

271
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,833
"In order to determine whether there is
anything we can know with certainty,

272
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:45,550
we first have to doubt
everything we know."

273
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,551
You know?

274
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:56,371
But as drunk as she was, when
she woke up the next morning,

275
00:12:56,946 --> 00:13:00,000
she still remembered room 110.
That's why she knocked on the door.

276
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,130
- She was looking for me.
- Oh, my God.

277
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:06,683
Yeah, and in all these years, Lily and
I have never even spoken about it,

278
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,032
so again, mum's
the word, okay?

279
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,861
You have to tell Marshall.

280
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:12,423
No, if, if he heard that,
it would destroy him.

281
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:17,713
If you don't tell him...
...I will.

282
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,963
Oh, come on, you wouldn't.

283
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,240
So, Lily,
how did you and Ted meet?

284
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:31,661
Come on, Lily, the real story.

285
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,592
I don't think anyone wants
to hear that story.

286
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,691
Aw, don't be embarrassed, Ted,
it was a long time ago.

287
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,911
And I made a huge mistake
last night,

288
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,373
but it's like
Descartes says.

289
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:44,620
"In order to determine whether there is
anything we can know with certainty,

290
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:46,722
we first have to doubt
everything we know."

291
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,353
And I now know for certain
that I love you, Karen.

292
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,910
Anyway, call me back
when you get this.

293
00:13:55,156 --> 00:13:58,592
I'm also going down to the computer
center to send you an electronic mail.

294
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:06,641
- This is Lily.
- No, no, I'm sorry, but I love Karen.

295
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:11,363
Yes, that is the unabridged
story of how Lily and I met.

296
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,230
How embarrassing.
Who wants another round?

297
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,902
- That's not the story. Ted, tell 'em.
- Tell us what?

298
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,973
Um, Lily, will you help us get
the next round?

299
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,373
- Ted, what's going on?
- She knows about us,

300
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:25,780
- about how we really met.
- Yeah, I know, I just told her.

301
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,422
No, the real story.

302
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:30,201
Ted, what are you
talking about?

303
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:32,861
Lily... come on.

304
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,562
Come on, what?

305
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,350
Lily... come on.

306
00:14:38,098 --> 00:14:40,423
Ted, I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

307
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:43,311
Lily... come on.

308
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:47,801
I know that you and Ted made out
the night before you met Marshall.

309
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,472
What?

310
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:52,382
- Ted and I never made out.
- Yeah... we did.

311
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:56,220
I only made out with one other guy
in college before I met Marshall,

312
00:14:56,327 --> 00:15:00,203
and it was just some random dude.
I, I don't even remember his name.

313
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:02,130
I just call him
Too Much Tongue Guy.

314
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,222
What? Too Much Tongue Guy?

315
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:05,483
Well, I'm not surprised to hear that
coming from

316
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,681
Unreasonably Small Mouth
Opening Girl.

317
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,212
That wasn't me.

318
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,710
Yes, it was, at the
freshman orientation party.

319
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:15,052
No, no, no, no, no.

320
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:19,011
No, no.
No, no, no, no, nooo!

321
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:21,551
How much fun is this?

322
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:24,211
All of us reminiscing
about how we met me?

323
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,763
Robin, have I told you
how I met Marshall?

324
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:29,590
- Uh, yeah, like five or six ti--
- It was right over there.

325
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:33,022
Here's your problem.
You've only slept with one woman.

326
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,433
Those kind of stats
are only okay if you're 11,

327
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,702
but tonight
we're getting you a new girl

328
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:41,691
because, Marshall Eriksen,
from this moment on,

329
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,431
I make all your decisions for you.

330
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:47,531
I'm sorry, who,
who are you again?

331
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,643
This is Barney, I met
him the other day.

332
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:51,701
He's kind of a jackass.

333
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,443
I'm teaching Ted how to live,

334
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:56,151
and, lucky you, I have room
for one more student.

335
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:58,052
Think of me as Yoda,

336
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,761
only instead of being little and green,
I wear suits and I'm awesome.

337
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:04,622
I'm your bro.
I'm Bro-da.

338
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,550
And tonight,
you're going to use The Force

339
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:10,301
to get the hottest chick
in this bar into bed.

340
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:12,101
He's going to use force?

341
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,090
'Cause that sounds
wrong, Bro-da.

342
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:17,931
No, The Force.
It's a Star Wars reference.

343
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,941
So we should make lots of
Star Wars references around girls.

344
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:21,323
That's what you're saying?

345
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:23,392
I'm not going to cheat
on my girlfriend.

346
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:26,990
Yes, you are, with the hottie
that just walked in.

347
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,450
Look at her.

348
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:31,581
How much hotter
is she than your girlfriend?

349
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,891
There's no comparison.

350
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,950
What do you think, Ted?
Should I go for it?

351
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:39,671
Don't do it, man.
I mean, think about Lily.

352
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:41,671
You know what?
I don't care.

353
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:45,042
I've been with one woman for too long.
I need me some strange.

354
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,593
Yes! Yes!
Pep talk.

355
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:51,711
You can do this,
but to be more accurate,

356
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:53,392
you probably can't.

357
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:56,373
You're way out of practice and
she is way too hot for you,

358
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:59,342
so remember, tonight
isn't about scoring.

359
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:02,191
It's about believing
that you can do it

360
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:04,491
even though
you probably can't.

361
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,733
Go get 'em, tiger.

362
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,060
Poor guy's going
to crash and burn.

363
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:24,002
That man is a god.

364
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:27,830
For like a week after,
Barney followed me around

365
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:29,691
asking me
to teach him how to live.

366
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:31,843
I even got him
to do my laundry once.

367
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,092
I thought it was a Mr.
Miyagi kind of thing.

368
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:38,232
Marshall, I need to talk to you.
Can we go somewhere in private?

369
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:39,971
Yeah, of course.
What's wrong?

370
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,343
Lily and Ted made out.

371
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,212
What do you think of that,
Robin?

372
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,320
What are you talking about?

373
00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:49,213
You know that guy I made out with
at the freshman orientation party?

374
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,961
Too Much Tongue Guy, yeah.

375
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,951
And you know that girl I made out with
at the freshman orientation party?

376
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:56,633
Unreasonably Small
Mouth Opening Girl, yeah.

377
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:58,170
I'm Too Much Tongue Guy.

378
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,811
And I'm Unreasonably
Small Mouth Opening Girl.

379
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:03,263
Worst superheroes ever.

380
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,190
Oh, baby, I am so sorry.

381
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,632
I don't think
you need to be.

382
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:10,103
I was at that party.
It was dark and, granted,

383
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,531
I had eaten quite a few
sandwiches, but,

384
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,860
I'm 100% sure that Unreasonably
Small Mouth Opening Girl

385
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:17,863
was Alexa Leskeys, not Lily.

386
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,180
- Really?
- Yeah,

387
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:23,003
I'm positive, and Too Much Tongue
Guy was Colin O'Reilly.

388
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,430
Are you sure?

389
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:27,510
If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong
guy's shampoo, man.

390
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:32,411
You don't really
believe that, do you?

391
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,420
You swore it was Lily.

392
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,753
I guess I made a mistake.

393
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,850
Must have been Alexa.

394
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:43,831
Another girl, Ted?

395
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:45,943
Who haven't you made out with?

396
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:47,801
You know what?
I don't need this.

397
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,902
I design handbags,
I'm writing a memoir,

398
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:52,221
I'm a superstar,
this is totally my year.

399
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:54,941
Someday the name Blahblah
will be up in lights.

400
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:58,030
And, Ted, next time you're online
playing World of Warcraft,

401
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,533
don't even think
about chatting with me.

402
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,671
World of Warcraft?

403
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,900
The online
role-playing game?

404
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:12,173
That's how you two
"met online"?

405
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:16,631
<i>"We shoul grab some
coffee sometime..."</i>

406
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:19,711
<i>"Yes, we should."</i>

407
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:21,413
<i>"What's your name?"</i>

408
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:23,971
<i>"Ted. What's yours?"</i>

409
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,073
Yeah, it's a really...
it's a cool game.

410
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:28,230
<i>So suffice it to say,</i>

411
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:30,751
<i>Blahblah did not turn out
to be your mother,</i>

412
00:19:30,828 --> 00:19:32,951
<i>and as for the girl
I made out with at the party,</i>

413
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:36,320
<i>there wasn't a doubt in my mind
that was your Aunt Lily.</i>

414
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:39,742
<i>But, you know, that magical story
of how she and Uncle Marshall met,</i>

415
00:19:39,818 --> 00:19:42,653
<i>it was worth preserving,
so I kept my mouth shut.</i>

416
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:44,652
I guess I made a mistake.

417
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,460
Must have been Alexa.

418
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:47,710
<i>Until...</i>

419
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,951
<i>our 20th college reunion
when I ran into...</i>

420
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:52,973
<i>Alexa Leskeys.</i>

421
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:56,751
So, Ted, remember
the last time we were here?

422
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,533
You and me?
No idea.

423
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,932
Ted... come on.

424
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,642
Freshman year,
we were both pretty drunk?

425
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:15,001
That was you?

426
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:18,353
Lily, we never made out.

427
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:19,262
I know.

428
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:22,451
So I am not Too
Much Tongue Guy.

429
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:25,333
- Actually...
- No.

430
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:33,442
Look what I've confiscated
from some kids.

431
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:37,953
- That is a fat sandwich.
- I know, right?

432
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:49,542
Chew, chew, chew,
chew, swallow.

433
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:54,900
Oh, that's all right,
honey.

434
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:57,142
Sandwiches are strong
these days.

435
00:20:57,267 --> 00:21:00,303
I can't believe I used to be able to eat
a whole sandwich by myself.

436
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:02,863
Now it's like two
bites and I am done.

437
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,032
Baby, can we grow sandwiches
behind the garage?

438
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,831
Dude, we're 42.

439
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:13,472
W-W-Where's my wife?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
