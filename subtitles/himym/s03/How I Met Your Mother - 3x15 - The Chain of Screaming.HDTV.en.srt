1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:03,403
<i>Kids, the spring of 2008
was a pretty great time for me.</i>

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,350
<i>Stella and I
had started dating,</i>

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,983
<i>and I'd just gotten
a big raise at work,</i>

4
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>so I decided
to purchase something</i>

5
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:10,589
<i>I knew it would be
the envy of all my friends.</i>

6
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,870
A new car!

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,155
Ted, this is New York City,
you're never gonna drive it.

8
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:17,229
This is a really,
really stupid purchase,

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,462
and, and I'm sorry,
but none of us can support it.

10
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:21,940
Shotgun for eternity!

11
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,742
- You can't call shotgun for eternity.
- I just called it.

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,259
You can't just call things, Barney.

13
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:27,477
I call that I can call things!

14
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,170
Hey, baby.

15
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:31,183
Beer.

16
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:32,840
Are you okay?

17
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:34,470
Beer.

18
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:43,723
Okay, what happened?

19
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:44,932
They always told me that...

20
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,570
that working at a big law firm
was like being at war.

21
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:50,281
<i>You get out of law school,
it's like getting out of boot camp.</i>

22
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,902
<i>That first day at work,
you're storming the beaches,</i>

23
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:54,440
<i>full of piss and vinegar...</i>

24
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:57,320
- Dude, we're lawyers now.
- Totally.

25
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,013
We've got briefcases and everything.

26
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:00,890
Freakin' briefcases.

27
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,211
- You have anything in yours?
- Totally empty. You?

28
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:04,603
Candy bars.

29
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:11,231
<i>Then you get in the trenches
side by side with your buddies</i>

30
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,882
<i>and you feel a sense of camaraderie.</i>

31
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,432
<i>But before too long...</i>

32
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:15,552
Hey, Marshall.

33
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:16,823
<i>...the shells start to fall.</i>

34
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:17,852
Hello, Arthur.

35
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:22,093
Arthur Hobbes is one of the
senior partners at my firm, and

36
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:23,642
he's... he's my boss.

37
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:26,481
He seems like a nice guy,
but he's got a nickname...

38
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,131
Artillery Arthur.

39
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:30,961
How's your morning going?

40
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:32,860
It's going fine, how is yours?

41
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,431
Not too bad, not too bad.

42
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,282
Hey, is Ferguson in yet?

43
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:38,712
He is, he's in,
just in his office next door.

44
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,743
That's great.
Have a good one, buddy.

45
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:41,941
You, too.

46
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:45,802
<i>You never know
who's gonna get hit...</i>

47
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:47,203
<i>Hey, Ferguson!</i>

48
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,583
<i>I read your report,
and it's complete crap!</i>

49
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:51,801
<i>No, you know what?
That's an insult to crap.</i>

50
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:55,283
<i>If crap could eat and then
crap stuff out, it's that!</i>

51
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,832
<i>Your report is the crap
that crap craps!</i>

52
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:01,642
<i>If you last two more days here,
I'll be shocked!</i>

53
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:02,483
<i>Shocked!</i>

54
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:06,191
It was brutal,

55
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:08,851
but the worst was
a few minutes later.

56
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,400
Did you hear that?

57
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:15,162
Yeah, sorry.

58
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:19,481
Can you believe he did that on
Take Your Daughter to Work Day?

59
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:24,921
So that brings us to today.

60
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:26,151
Oh, no.

61
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:27,083
A little background.

62
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:28,862
So I'm working on
this report called

63
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:32,093
"Using 23-b-3 Spurious
Class Action Precedent to

64
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:34,092
"Contest a Class Certification Order

65
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:36,590
Based On A Lack of Commonality,
Numerosity..."

66
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,640
Dude, you lost us.

67
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,223
Can't you just call it something cool
like "the Ninja Report"?

68
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,240
Okay. Yeah, fine, whatever.

69
00:02:43,347 --> 00:02:45,730
Um, so I'm supposed to turn in
"the Ninja Report" yesterday.

70
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,401
- Awesome.
- Cool.

71
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:50,132
But I got insanely busy
with other stuff,

72
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,262
I didn't get a chance to finish it,

73
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,130
and then this morning...

74
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:55,893
<i>- Hey, Ferguson.
- Hey, Arthur.</i>

75
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:57,493
<i>- How's your day going?</i>
- I gotta go.

76
00:02:57,596 --> 00:02:59,903
<i>- Great. How is yours?
- Great, great.</i>

77
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,121
<i>Hey, is Marshall in yet?</i>

78
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,293
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

79
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:04,511
<i>Yeah, he's right in there.</i>

80
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,910
<i>Fantastic.
Have a good one, buddy.</i>

81
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:11,380
<i>And then...</i>

82
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:13,150
He screamed at me.

83
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:15,051
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

84
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,900
What, that's it?

85
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,203
You're upset because
a guy talked loudly near you?

86
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,851
Barney, I have never been
screamed at like that in my life.

87
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,400
Come on, when's the last time
you got screamed at at work?

88
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:27,622
I got screamed at
three times today.

89
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:28,631
Once in Korean.

90
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,840
This is corporate America, Marshall.

91
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,580
Screaming is a motivational tool,

92
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:36,360
like christmas bonuses
or sexual harassment.

93
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,032
It's just good business.

94
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:41,240
Oh, baby, it's just not fair.

95
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,540
You've been working so hard.

96
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:46,143
Late nights, weekends.

97
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,513
I never see you.

98
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,922
We've barely made love in weeks.

99
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,142
It's bad, guys.
Mama needs her sugar.

100
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:03,480
Look, Marshall,
he screamed at you, you took it.

101
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,181
He probably
respects you more for it.

102
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:08,310
Yeah, about that...

103
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,361
So Arthur's busy giving me
the full screaming treatment...

104
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,652
<i>Face turning red,</i>

105
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:18,322
<i>vein in his forehead
about to burst,</i>

106
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:21,181
<i>spittle flying like shrapnel.</i>

107
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:24,763
<i>Everyone you work with
walking by your office, peering in.</i>

108
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:32,382
<i>And suddenly, I just
felt all of it.</i>

109
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:33,793
All of what?

110
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,353
All of it.

111
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,103
The fact that I became a lawyer
to save the environment,

112
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,513
end now I'm working
for the bad guys instead.

113
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:42,703
The fact that
I am stuck in this job

114
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,580
because of a mortgage
I can barely afford

115
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,742
on an apartment
that is crooked.

116
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:48,532
The fact that I am a grown man,

117
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:50,813
and nobody,
not even Artillery Arthur,

118
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,440
has the right to
talk to me like that!

119
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,662
<i>I begged my body not to do it.</i>

120
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,863
<i>But it was no use.</i>

121
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,830
Oh, God,

121
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:08,621
I just... I just...

122
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:17,021
Just because you weren't
around for this,

123
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:19,301
I called shotgun
for all eternity in Ted's car.

124
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,770
How I Met Your Mother 3x15
<i>- The Chain of Screaming -</i>

125
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:38,390
Dude, I can't believe you cried
in front of your boss.

126
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,862
I don't know what happened.

127
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,193
There's just something about
being yelled at like that,

128
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:44,402
like I was being
scolded by my dad.

129
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,292
Suddenly...
suddenly I was a little boy.

130
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:49,731
Is "boy" the right word?

132
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:52,502
I felt absolutely powerless.

134
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:55,700
Flaccid. Hell, I...
I felt castrated.

136
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:57,411
God, you're hot right now.

137
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:00,981
And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning
I have to walk into Arthur's office

138
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:02,871
and give him the Ninja Report.

139
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:05,301
- Ooh. ooh.
- Ninjas are cool.

140
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,811
How the hell am I supposed
to face this guy again?

141
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:10,803
Here's what I would do
if I were you.

142
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:12,983
Hi, Arthur.

143
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:16,060
Hello, Marshall. Have you finally
finished the Ninja Report?

144
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:18,112
Yeah, I got it.

145
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,679
Right here.

146
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,707
I think it's gonna blow you away.

147
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,781
Please, I have a family.

148
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:29,301
So we good?

149
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:31,120
We're so good.

150
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,282
Then why are you still
in my office?

151
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:43,923
Okay, gun violence might be the answer
to everything up in Canada, Robin,

152
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:47,382
but here in America,
we solve our problems with words.

153
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:50,350
Marshall, you go in
and you dazzle this guy

154
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:53,361
with a big eloquent speech
defending human dignity.

155
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:54,760
Like Abraham Lincoln.

156
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:57,830
Yeah, because it's so easy
just to bust out

157
00:06:57,937 --> 00:07:00,150
a big, eloquent speech
off the top of your head.

158
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:02,661
Observe.

159
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,081
- Arthur?
- What do you want, Marshall?

160
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,072
Justice, sir.

161
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,702
You see, we are all born
with certain incontrovertible rights,

162
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:12,540
the most fundamentally
paramount of which is the right...

163
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,061
Wait, you can't be
fundamentally paramount.

164
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,862
One means highest,
one means lowest.

165
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,710
You are nailing this.

166
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,221
Human beings have rights,

167
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,760
and those rights are, um...

168
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:26,932
You got me hooked, reel me in.

169
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:29,052
There are certain justices

170
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:31,102
that cannot or will not

171
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:34,150
be inalienable... as such...

172
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:35,962
for the future.

173
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:38,003
Stuck the landing...
Bravo!

174
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,250
Thank you.

175
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:44,402
Security's gonna rough you up
a bit on the way out.

176
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:49,851
Guys, guys,
this is not helping, okay?

177
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,511
I can't have some
big confrontation with Arthur.

178
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:54,790
I need this job,
I... I need the money.

179
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,001
Yeah, but how good would it feel
to walk in there tomorrow,

180
00:07:57,107 --> 00:07:59,650
- tell him off and then quit?
- It's great to fantasize about,

181
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:01,821
but nobody ever actually does it.

182
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,581
Gary Blauman did it.

183
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:06,961
Guy I used to work with,
the guy's a legend now.

184
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,383
We were at the morning meeting

185
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,342
and old Blauman
was getting reamed out but good.

186
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,342
<i>Pretty much routine
at the morning meeting,</i>

187
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:17,262
<i>but then, on this particular day,
something amazing happened.</i>

188
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,630
You made yourself look bad,

189
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:21,292
you made this company look bad,
and quite frankly,

190
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:24,760
you made our friends,
the North Koreans, look bad!

191
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:27,612
And I'll tell you something else,
Blauman, if you think for one...

192
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,202
You know what, Bilson?

193
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,301
You can kiss my ass.

194
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,202
Oh, snap.

195
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:35,400
- What?
- You heard me.

196
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:38,012
I don't need to take
your crap anymore.

197
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,223
My cousin's website
went public today,

198
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,571
and I made a pile of money
on the IPO,

199
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:46,522
so you know what I think
of this whole damn company?

200
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:53,180
- Oh, my God.
- He peed on the conference table?

201
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:58,103
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on...

202
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:00,311
Uh, look,
could you guys just...

203
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,150
look away for a second
till I get started?

204
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,302
Come on.

205
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,090
Does this help?

206
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:12,392
Eventually, he just gave up and left.

207
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,591
And then his cousin's website tanked.

208
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,931
And then he became a janitor
at an old folks' home

209
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:20,872
and moved into a one-room apartment
above a bowling alley.

210
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:24,600
That's it?
That's the end of the story?

211
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,882
No, no, of course not.
He died.

212
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:29,033
How does that help me?

213
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,722
How does any of this help me?

214
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:33,003
Can somebody,
for God's sakes,

215
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,800
please give me
one piece of useful advice?

216
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:37,760
Lily, control your woman.

217
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:42,133
The lesson of Blauman
is that when your boss

218
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,423
screams at you,
you never scream back.

219
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,903
That's why there's a little thing
in corporate America

220
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,610
I like to call
the Chain of Screaming.

221
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:51,560
- Chain of Screaming?
- Yes.

222
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,212
The Chain of Screaming
starts at the top.

223
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:57,393
<i>Arthur's boss's boss
screams at Arthur's boss.</i>

224
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,822
<i>Arthur's boss screams at Arthur.</i>

225
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:02,053
<i>Arthur screams at you.</i>

226
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,592
<i>You go home and scream at Lily.</i>

227
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:08,883
<i>Lily screams at one of the kids
in her kindergarten class.</i>

228
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:12,153
<i>Then that kid
screams at her dad,</i>

229
00:10:12,256 --> 00:10:14,721
<i>Arthur's boss's boss.</i>

230
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,353
And the whole thing
starts all over again,

231
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:20,472
thus completing
the Circle of Screaming.

232
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,311
I thought it was
a Chain of Screaming.

233
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,882
It's a circle, Ted,
I called it a circle.

234
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:26,691
I don't scream at Lily.

235
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:28,723
And I don't scream at my kids,

236
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,683
none of whom have parents
who work at Marshall's firm.

237
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,150
So it's not a circle.

238
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,553
Fine. You want it to be
a Chain of Screaming,

239
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:36,923
it's a chain of screaming.

240
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,873
I came up with the circle idea
halfway through,

241
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:40,573
cause I thought it was
a more elegant metaphor,

242
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:41,952
but fine, ruin it!

243
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:44,080
You guys always undermine me

244
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:46,010
when I'm trying to make a point,
and I'm sick of it!

245
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:49,453
God, I'm surrounded by idiots!

246
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,801
Idiots!

247
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:56,010
See, doesn't everyone
feel better now?

248
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,550
Lily, I need your take on this.
What...

249
00:10:58,655 --> 00:10:59,953
what should I do?

250
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,852
Well, what I teach
my kids in kindergarten...

251
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:03,312
Oh, God.

252
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:06,331
...is, when
dealing with a bully,

253
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:09,693
the most important thing is
to be constructive and positive.

254
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,570
- Hello, Arthur.
- Hello, Marshall.

255
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:15,853
I have the Ninja Report right here.

256
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,971
But Arthur, in the future, if you want
someone to do their best work,

257
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:23,680
try to motivate them,
not with fear and intimidation,

258
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:27,331
but through encouragement,
inspiration and respect.

259
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,842
Well said, Marshall,
I... I needed to hear that.

260
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:35,520
By the way, I saw your wife's
picture in your office.

261
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,453
That is one tasty slice.

262
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,320
Oh, you're damn right.

263
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:41,371
You know what I'm gonna do
when I get home?

264
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:42,420
Oh, yeah.

265
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:44,771
I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...

266
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:45,662
That's it.

267
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,660
...just throw her on the bed...

268
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,102
That's where she belongs.

269
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,092
...and drive her home
like a pack of sled dogs!

270
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,312
It's bad, guys.

271
00:11:58,415 --> 00:11:59,702
Mama needs it bad.

272
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,002
You're right, baby,
it's about respect.

273
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:06,861
That is the first useful thing
anyone's said to me tonight.

274
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,393
Can you give me
that speech again?

275
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:09,920
I'm gonna drive her home
like a pack of...

276
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,242
No, the other part, please.

277
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,750
I have the Ninja Report
right here, but...

278
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,752
<i>And it seemed like
that was the end of it,</i>

279
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:17,803
<i>but it wasn't,
because the next night...</i>

280
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,373
Which of these carpets would
look better in the new apartment?

281
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:23,282
I like the color
of this one, but...

282
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:26,811
this one's so soft. It would
feel great on your bare feet...

283
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,481
...or your bare back,
a bead of eager sweat

284
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:35,052
rolling down
your trembling bosom.

285
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:41,110
Lily, didn't we just go through
this with bathroom tiles?

286
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:45,430
Shh, don't say my name.

287
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:48,120
Lily can't know it's me.
Just pretend you're talking to Stella.

288
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,413
Be all lovey dovey.

289
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,041
Hey, Stella.

290
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:54,383
Sweetie, how's it going?

291
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:57,512
Not good, not good at all.

292
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:58,881
Where are you right now?

293
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,973
Right downstairs, come find me.

294
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,711
Without Lily.

295
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:06,222
Okay, I'll see you soon.

296
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:08,603
I love you.

297
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:10,373
I love you, too.

298
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,361
Wow, you two are already
saying the "L" word, huh?

299
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:17,150
Apparently.

300
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:19,572
You hitting that?

301
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,560
- Oh, oh.
- I'm in trouble, Ted.

302
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,562
Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.

303
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:37,602
It's a new car,
so just be careful...

304
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:40,461
I did something stupid...
can we just drive somewhere?

305
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,712
I need to get away, just drive,
man. Please just drive.

306
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:46,900
It's just, this is
a really good parking spot.

306
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,000
Dude!

307
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,603
Look, just tell me
what happened first.

308
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:51,523
Remember how I said
I was gonna give that

309
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:53,973
big speech that Lily told me
to give, be firm but respectful?

310
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:55,863
Well, it didn't totally go that way.

311
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,603
There is a lot of ketchup
on that burger.

312
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,240
Sorry... what happened?

313
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,823
After we all finished
talking last night,

314
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,580
I went to the diner to finish
working on the Ninja Report.

315
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,451
<i>Hey, Marshall.</i>

316
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,233
How long have you been
sitting there?

317
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,860
If you go in there with
Lily's kindergarten nonsense,

318
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:15,412
you're gonna get torn apart.

319
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,133
I'm here to save your life.
You hungry?

320
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:20,163
- Yeah, I was just about to order.
- What do you want ?

321
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:21,840
A BLT and gravy fries.

322
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:24,513
Okay, friends,
what do you like?

323
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,621
A green tea with lemon for me,

324
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:28,142
and for my friend here,

325
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:29,720
- the meatloaf, please.
- Very good.

326
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,263
- No, I didn't want meatloaf.
- Marshall,

327
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,353
the Chain of Screaming
is a real thing.

328
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,983
Arthur screamed at you, now
you have to scream at someone else.

329
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,110
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do,

330
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:43,400
or else that anger
is gonna eat you alive.

331
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,301
Who would I even scream at?

332
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:47,630
I don't know.

333
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:50,101
How about somebody
who's disappointed you?

334
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:52,182
Someone who's let you down.

335
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:55,000
Someone who's gonna
bring you meatloaf

336
00:14:55,108 --> 00:15:00,173
when you explicitly ordered
a BLT and gravy fries.

337
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,731
No.

338
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:07,262
I was just heading to the bar.
What are you guys doing here ?

339
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:08,971
I was just telling Ted a story.

340
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,632
I like stories.

341
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:12,890
You want a lick?

342
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,192
What?

343
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,632
Is that ice cream cone big enough?

344
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:18,521
Uh, it's delicious enough.

345
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:21,842
Okay, so...
Then I say to barney...

346
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,930
I'm not gonna scream at
the waiter, Barney.

347
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:26,432
Yes, you are.

348
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:30,463
That waiter is every boss
and every bully

349
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:32,763
who ever embarrassed
or belittled you.

350
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:36,563
And how dare he deny you
the one thing that you want,

351
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,881
that would make you happy
at this moment.

352
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,043
A BLT and gravy fries.

353
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,400
One green tea with lemon,

354
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:46,540
one meatloaf.

355
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,390
Enjoy, my friends.

356
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:49,433
Marshall.

357
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:51,440
Excuse me?

358
00:15:53,158 --> 00:15:54,060
Yes?

359
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,531
This is not what I ordered.

360
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:58,392
Yes, it is.

361
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:03,371
I beg your pardon, sir,

362
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:06,303
but I ordered a BLT
and gravy fries,

363
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:08,743
And as the customer,
I'm always right, so...

364
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:12,443
No, no, I am not going
to stand here and take this!

365
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,161
I am at the end of a triple shift,
that's 18 hours!

366
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:19,642
And then I have to take two trains
and a bus to Astoria

367
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:22,701
to have my wife scream at me
because I'm never home.

368
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:25,840
No, no, you eat
your damn meatloaf!

369
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,431
Hey, what are you guys
doing out here?

370
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,333
Oh sweet, can I get a toot?

371
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:33,961
Against car rules,
this is against car rules!

372
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:36,040
Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban.

373
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:38,480
People pay to have their car
smell like this.

374
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:40,062
Well, that's just not true.

375
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,813
Oh, Marshall,
switch seats with me.

376
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:44,912
- I called shotgun for all eternity.
- You can't call shotgun for eternity.

377
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:46,992
- Well, that's funny, cause I did!
- It's case by case.

378
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:50,781
Guys, I'm telling
a life-altering story here!

379
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,580
A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?

380
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,463
I don't know, Barney,
he worked a triple...

381
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:56,900
- it just...
- I can't believe... you know what ?

382
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,771
If you're not gonna yell
at the waiter,

383
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,660
Yell at me.

384
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,080
- What?
- Yell at me.

385
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,963
I'm not gonna yell at you,
Barney.

386
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:05,271
What, you think
you're gonna upset me?

387
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,920
Please, give me your best shot.

388
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:09,550
Okay, fine, what,
you want me to yell at you?

389
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,801
This is me
yelling at you, Barney.

390
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:17,101
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
over the sound of a butterfly

391
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,851
landing on a leaf
about three blocks away.

392
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,441
This is me
yelling at you, Barney!

393
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:25,513
Okay, you got some volume,
now give me some content.

394
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:26,822
Make it hurt.

395
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:30,033
You don't look as good in suits
as you think you do!

396
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:31,830
No, something that's true.
Come on.

397
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,743
The man made you cry.
Make me cry.

398
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,122
Your mom's a slut!

399
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:37,542
Yes.

400
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:40,433
Your mom's a slut,
and I'm sorry, Barney,

401
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:42,933
but you and your brother
clearly have different fathers,

402
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:46,251
And you know why? It's probably
because your mom is a slutty slut!

403
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,820
- Keep going.
- I don't care what you say.

404
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:50,763
Bob Barker is not your father!

405
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,971
Okay, now, well,
that's just not cool.

406
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:54,400
Oh my Bod, Barney,
I'm so sorry...

407
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,881
No, I'm kidding...
Keep going.

408
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,533
Bob Barker's not your father!

409
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:01,321
You've concocted this delusional idea
that a game show host

410
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:02,973
Is your real father,
and he's not!

411
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,943
You were abandoned, Barney!

412
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:06,730
You were abandoned,
and you never dealt with it,

413
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,143
and so now you never
allow yourself to feel anything,

414
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,322
and that's how you survive
in this corporate world,

415
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,453
and if I keep heading down this path,
I'm gonna turn into you!

416
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:17,252
And I don't want that!

417
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:19,140
I don't want any of this!

418
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:20,950
This is not why
I became a lawyer.

419
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:24,071
This is not the person
that I wanted to be.

420
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:26,111
I quit, Arthur!

421
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:28,210
I quit!

422
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:34,682
Well, thank you, Eriksen,
I needed to hear that.

423
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:38,101
Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack
you personally, it's just that I...

424
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:40,301
No, no, no, the part
where you said, "I quit."

425
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:43,171
Now we don't have to
pay you a severance package.

426
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,273
Uh, security's gonna rough you up
a bit on the way out.

427
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,240
Robin, you dropped
a little ice cream...

428
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,242
Dude!

429
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,472
I'm sorry.

430
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,162
Don't blame this on me,
Marshall.

431
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:02,571
I told you to yell
at someone beneath you.

432
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:04,043
The Circle of Screaming is...

433
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:06,210
The Chain of Scr...

434
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:08,803
Pyramid,
the Pyramid of Screaming!

435
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,500
The Pyramid of Screaming.

436
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,762
How am I supposed to tell Lily?

437
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,133
She supported me through
three years of law school,

438
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,983
and now is the time when
I'm supposed to pay her back.

439
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:20,012
Now we're gonna lose the apartment.

440
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,572
The place where we were
gonna raise our children.

441
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,130
How am I supposed to tell the person who
I love more than anything in this world

442
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:28,861
that I've just
thrown away our future?

443
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:36,202
Everybody out, everybody out of
the new car! Out of the new car!

444
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,882
Ted, screaming never solves anything.

445
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:43,062
<i>And so Marshall finally had
to tell Lily what happened.</i>

446
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,493
I'm so sorry.

447
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:47,171
I just lost it.

448
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:49,080
But I can fix it.

449
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:53,711
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go
in there on my hands and knees and...

450
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:55,551
and beg for my job back.

451
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:58,470
No, you're not.

452
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:00,671
What?

453
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:04,813
Marshall, our future
isn't money or an apartment.

454
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,490
And it's definitely not you being
miserable at that horrible job.

455
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:14,070
I'm just happy
to have my husband back.

456
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,323
We'll figure the rest out.

457
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,610
I love you.

458
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:21,202
I love you, too.

459
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:25,950
<i>Ultimately, they were able
to make ends meet</i>

460
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,833
<i>without going bust on
the apartment.</i>

461
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,930
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

462
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:35,171
Who needs a car
in New York City, right?

463
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:39,382
- Ted, I don't think I can accept...
- Marshall,

464
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,893
don't make me
scream at you.

465
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,573
Thanks a lot, buddy.

466
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:51,153
- You guys did it in the car, didn't...
- Oh yeah!

9999
