1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Now kids

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,920
She was

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,650
but by 2008

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,740
Coming up next,is your baby trying to kill you

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,500
啥maybe

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,460
so,

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,270
so I

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,880
and

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,310
because

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,740
what

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,320
I know

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,260
I spent

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,090
cotton balls,

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,750
half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,720
Totally. What's the occasion?

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,520
 And old friend from Canada  is in town

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,020
 and I'm meeting him  for a drink.

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,450
Ooh! Somebody you went   to Degrassi with?

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,150
 No. Actually, he was  my first boyfriend.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,750
   <i>Simon. I thought</i>   <i>he was the coolest guy ever.</i>

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,090
   <i>He smelled like Drakkar.</i>

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,190
 <i>He could ollie on a skateboard.</i>

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,320
   <i>He had the most amazing</i>   <i>collection</i>

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,520
  <i>of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts.</i>

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,390
  <i>We spent the whole summer</i>  <i>madly in love.</i>

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,490
 Tell me more.  Tell me more.

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
  Like, did he have a car?

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,650
 So he's the guy who...

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,190
How shall I say this   like a gentleman?

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,920
 Robin, did he take your maple leaf?

31
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,620
No, it wasn't like that.

32
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,250
 Sounds to me like he gave you  your first "O, Canada!" face.

33
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,120
  NARROR:   <i>This went on</i>    <i>for a really long time.</i>

34
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,450
 <i>Some of them jokes were elegant</i>   <i>and well-crafted...</i>

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,320
Wait, wait. Did he break up with you

36
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,150
and tell you he's just not that Inuit?

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,020
 (laughing)

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,650
  NARRATOR:  <i>...others were crude,</i>   <i>and ill-formed...</i>

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,150
Um, something about fur trapping.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,450
  NARRATOR:   <i>...and others were obvious,</i>    <i>but needed to be said...</i>

41
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,350
  Did you ride his Zamboni?

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,620
Oh! Come on!  Oh!

43
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,890
 (laughter)

44
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,950
  Wait, wait, wait.  Did he...?

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,750
I think I'm out.

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,960
Yeah, I'm also "oot."

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Okay, now I'm really out.

48
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,590
Well, I'm sorry, guys.  It was all very tame.

49
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,650
 We only dated for a week and a half.

50
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,020
 Wha...? I thought you said  you were together all summer.

51
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,150
Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty  much the last week of July.

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,620
Anyway, one night,

53
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,820
 his band just finish playing  this gig...

54
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,550
  (panting)

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,350
 Oh, my God! Simon.

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,150
 That was such a good show.

57
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,690
 You guys totally rocked out.

58
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,120
Yeah.

59
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,450
I know.

60
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,720
I figure we're about  four or five gigs away

61
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,020
 from really exploding.

62
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,350
  We're gonna be big, babe.

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,930
 I mean, like  Crash-Test-Dummies big.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,750
 So, that everything?

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,690
 Yeah.

66
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,300
 All right.

67
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,300
Listen, babe...

68
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,650
 It's over.

69
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,320
 What?

70
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,030
  I'm getting back together  with Louise Marsh.

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
Louise Marsh?!

72
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,950
That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.

73
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,420
 Yeah, why would he want to get back together  with Louise Marsh?

74
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,790
 Well, the thing is...

75
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,190
 her folks just put in a pool.

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,550
 Oh...  So...

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,250
I totally... I get it.

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,220
  Pools are great.

79
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,830
 Swimming's awesome.

80
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,850
 We have a sprinkler.

81
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,830
 Run right through it.

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,920
 Well, I should go.

83
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,360
Uh...

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,500
 Babe, wait.

85
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,890
 Yeah, Simon?

86
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,630
You forgot to load the drum set.

87
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,850
No!

88
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,490
Tell me you did not load the drum set.

89
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,850
 (drums feet):  I did.

90
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,620
(all groaning)

91
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,090
  And now he's coming here?

92
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,920
 Robin, why do you want to see this guy?

93
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,450
Oh! I know why.

94
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,120
You're gonna win, aren't you?

95
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,090
 I have no idea what   you' talking about.

96
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,420
Yes, you do.

97
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,120
Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time,

98
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,720
no matter how much you want to deny it,

99
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,850
there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.

100
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,720
Well, since you brought it up,

101
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,690
let's add up the points.

102
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,890
 You're starting out with two big ones right there.

103
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,350
  Thank you.

104
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,720
  Okay. So, Simon still  lives with his mom.

105
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,690
Point Robin.

106
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,590
Um, he never became

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,620
a rock star.

108
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,250
 Point Robin.

109
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,450
  He now works at a water slide  park outside of Ottawa.

110
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,890
Point Simon.

111
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,350
Wait. Do they have a wave pool?

112
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,490
No.

113
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,620
Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip.

114
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,120
 There's no coming back  from that.

115
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,450
 Yeah, he's going down.

116
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,100
 I mean, unless somehow,  he got hotter.

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
 There he is.

118
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,750
  NARRATOR:    <i>And sure enough,</i>   <i>there was a clear winner,</i>

119
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,560
  <i>and a clear loser.</i>

120
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,390
  NARRATOR:   <i>It just wasn't clear</i>  <i>to everybody.</i>

121
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,020
 Hey, babe.

122
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,990
 (giggling):  Oh, my God.

123
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,950
Okay, what the hell just happened?

124
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,590
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?

125
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,750
(others groan)

126
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,920
 Hey, Simon.

127
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,850
  Wow, look at you.

128
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,800
 You got old.

129
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,290
ROBIN: Yeah.

130
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,520
You look great.

131
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,390
You got hotter,

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,120
 like that's possible.

133
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,520
(giggles)

134
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,020
 So...

135
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,490
  Look, I know it didn't go  as planned,

136
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,550
but I can't help it.

137
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,950
I mean...

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,300
 he's still got it.

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,390
 Whoa! Four bucks for a brew?

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,290
 What a rip.

141
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,060
Good think I'm packing.

142
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,000
  (giggles)

143
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,790
 So he's not a snob.

144
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,120
  He's from a different part

145
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,550
 of Canada, you know?

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,890
The maple leaf flag on the back  of the pickup truck?

147
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,890
 He's Red Province.

148
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,650
  He's from the Deep North.

149
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,920
The thing is,

150
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,920
 we gave you so many  opportunities.

151
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,290
 So, Simon,

152
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,020
Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York.

153
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,590
  She's the lead anchor  at Metro News One.

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,890
Tell him, Robin.

155
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,150
No. It's stupid.

156
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,530
It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,890
  I'm sorry, Simon.

158
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,750
  Here we are nattering on   about our big celebrity.

159
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,520
 What do you do for a living?

160
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,150
Oh, I work at the Splish Splash   Ottawa Water Slide Park.

161
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,090
Huh! A water slide park.

162
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,690
That sure is different than what Robin does.

163
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,230
Yeah, it is...  because I save lives.

164
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,490
If I'm not sitting in that stool

165
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,120
  at the top of the slide,   going...

166
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,390
 Go...

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,150
  Go...

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,750
 Go...

169
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,360
 people die.

170
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,490
 What, you think it's so easy?

171
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,120
 You try it.

172
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,850
Um... (clears throat)... okay.

173
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,190
 Go.

174
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,120
You didn't put your hand up;  kid just died.

175
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,320
 No, I didn't know...

176
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,920
 Another kid just went; he died too.

177
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,490
Oh, well, sure.  I mean, if I was actually...

178
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,220
 Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up

179
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,350
  and Robin's got something  to report on the news.

180
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,720
  This just in:  My friend, Ted, just killed  a bunch of kids today.

181
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,190
 Well, that's cool.

182
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,790
You got to pay the bills somehow

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,120
since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?

184
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,090
 Well, it hasn't panned out yet,  but the band's still going.

185
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,190
About four or five gigs

186
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,290
away from really  exploding.

187
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,800
The Foreskins are still playing?

188
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,890
The Foreskins?

189
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,590
How'd you guys come up with that name?

190
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,850
(sighs)   Well, there's four of us,

191
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,730
 and we play without shirts.

192
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,550
  Babe, seriously.

193
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
 I know. I'm sorry.

194
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,620
 I know. I'm sorry.

195
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,690
  But you guys just   don't understand.

196
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,420
 The fact that he kept the band  going-- <i>that's</i> impressive.

197
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,550
  I mean, I gave up   my musical dream.

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,720
 Which brings us  to the most important piece

199
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,220
 of information from tonight.

200
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,590
 So, Simon,

201
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,820
how did you guys meet?

202
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,090
 Oh, I was in her video.

203
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,020
Starred in it is more like it.

204
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,050
 Well, once you win  Mr. Teen Winnipeg,

205
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,490
 <i>everybody</i> wants a piece  of the moneymaker.

206
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,720
 I'm sorry. I've seen "Let's Go to the Mall"

207
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,150
about a thousand times,  and you, sir, are not in it.

208
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,590
  No, I was   in the other one.

209
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,200
There's another video?!

210
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,250
  Robin, seriously,

211
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,120
just make this  easier on yourself

212
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,420
 and give us the tape.

213
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,820
 No.

214
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,920
 All right.

215
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,320
You leave me no choice.

216
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,490
From this moment on,

217
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,320
I will spend every waking minute   ching down this tape.

218
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,890
  I will not sleep. I will not eat.

219
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,790
  My life will be a living hell   of search engines

220
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,050
  and overseas phone calls,

221
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,650
chasing down something  that possibly can't be found.

222
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,930
 Okay.

223
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,350
It's just...

224
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,890
 It was so hard to watch, Robin.

225
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,820
 You're usually so cool.

226
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,450
 I don't know  what's wrong with me.

227
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,550
 I'm sitting next to Simon,  and suddenly I'm 16 again.

228
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,820
Oh, it's actually a common thing.

229
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,350
When you're around someone from your past,

230
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,650
you kind of revert back to who you were

231
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,020
when you knew them.

232
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,550
There's not really a name for it, though.

233
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,020
It's called "revertigo."

234
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,020
Yeah, I don't know about "revertigo."

235
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,250
  You know who gets   really bad revertigo?

236
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,950
 (whispers): Lily when she around

237
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,620
 her high school   friend, Michelle.

238
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,190
  Michelle? She sounds hot.

239
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,390
You don't know about Lily and Michelle?

240
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,220
No. What about  Lily and Michelle?

241
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,560
 Oh, my friend,  you are in for a treat.

242
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,590
  Hey, Lil? What?

243
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,090
 You know, I was  just thinking,

244
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,920
 we haven't seen your friend  Michelle in a while.

245
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,020
Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call,  see if she wants to hang out.

246
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,800
 Yeah.

247
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,590
 What... (stammers)   Do they make out?

248
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,650
Better.

249
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,520
 Comparable. Comparable.

250
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,460
  Whatever.  It's over. I lost.

251
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,890
  I guess you, uh,  you don't get second chance.

252
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,220
I got a second chance.

253
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,250
 What happened?

254
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,330
He came by my place tonight...

255
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,620
Simon.   What are you doing here?

256
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,490
  I just feel like there's   some unfinished business

257
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,200
 between you and me.

258
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,750
  Seeing you now...

259
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,920
 has made me realize   that breaking up with you

260
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,790
is the biggest mistake   I made in my entire life.

261
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,230
Oh, I like where  this is going.

262
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,220
 I know this is crazy,

263
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,390
 and I'm only in town  for a couple of days,

264
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,920
 but do you want to go  on a date?

265
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,250
 He asked you out?!

266
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,620
Oh, step into my web, Simon.

267
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,950
 The coup de grace.

268
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,400
  (a la Mortal Kombat):  Finish him!

269
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,820
I'd <i>love</i> to!

270
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,390
 Wait. You're going  on a date with Simon?

271
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,590
 That Simon?The one we met?

272
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,750
 Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance.

273
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,290
  Not after the way  he treated you.

274
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,120
That was ten years ago. People evolve.

275
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,830
I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?

276
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,190
  Oh, hell, no!

277
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,890
I think you're gonna enjoy this.

278
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,490
That my girl Michelle?  Bitch, you know it!

279
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,350
How she livin'?  She living only way she know how to.

280
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,690
Large!

281
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,490
Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.

282
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,290
  I'm hoping my t ass can  hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.

283
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,060
For reals.

284
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,550
  I want her around   all the time.

285
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,920
  I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her

286
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,230
if that's what it takes.

287
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,030
 Guys, I've decided  to seduce Michelle.

288
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,950
 (rock music playing)

289
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,050
  (laughs)

290
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,720
 (song ends)

291
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,950
(Robin whoops)

292
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,450
Yeah!   Guys, that was great.

293
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,090
Let's take five.

294
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,820
 Hey, babe,  did you like it

295
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,320
 after my bass solo when   I flicked my pick at you?

296
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,520
 That rocked.

297
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,190
 Yeah.

298
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,450
  Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.

299
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,890
 Oh, uh, sure.

300
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,490
  Um, I think it...

301
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,520
  It's cool. You'll  find it later. Oh, cool.

302
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,590
I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.

303
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,990
 Oh, but, babe, you  got to go to work.

304
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,050
 You got to play our  demo on your show.

305
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,850
Oh, well, you know, it's not a show.

306
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,250
It's the news.

307
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,620
  Right. So you   can be, like,

308
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,090
 "Hey, did you hear  there's some news?

309
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,120
 There's a rad band you  guys should check out."

310
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,520
  And then play it.

311
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,260
 Or just, like, the  first three songs.

312
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,390
  And now it's time  for "Puppy Corner,"

313
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,090
 some little angels looking for a new home,

319
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,190
  Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted.

320
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,120
 Of course, a lot of the   people calling in thought

321
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,990
  we were going   to kill them.

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,250
 Robin, your revertigo is really   starting to affect your work.

323
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,990
What's revertigo?

324
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,850
 It's a stupid, made-up word   with no meaning.

325
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,490
 No. It's a   phenomenon where,

326
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,420
 when you're around  people from your past,

327
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,420
 you start behaving  like them.

328
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,220
Oh. One example of that springs to mind.

329
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,830
I think we all know what it is.

330
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,890
 You do?

331
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,590
Yeah. Ted.

332
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,890
Me?

333
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,590
Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town,

334
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,220
it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.

335
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,620
TED: Okay, okay.

336
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,950
 First of all,  his name is Adam Punciarello,

337
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,690
 and I don't do that.

338
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,950
(both scoffing)

339
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,390
 (knocking, classical music plays)

340
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,530
Ooh. That must be Adam.

341
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,350
'Sup, Punchy?  'Sup, Shmosby?!

342
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,950
You want to go?  I'm alrey there!

343
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,360
Come on!  This is it!

344
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,020
  Dude, seriously,   I'm sorry about your dad.

345
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,900
  Yeah, it was   a real shock.

346
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,720
I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.

347
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,690
Why?

348
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,750
No reason.

349
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,950
Robin, the point is,  what are you doing?

350
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,520
  I mean, this guy?

351
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,220
  Okay, you want the truth?

352
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,290
Yeah. I like Simon.

353
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,790
I do.

354
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,290
 We have fun together.

355
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,050
Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.

356
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,220
You're worried?

357
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,520
Okay, hold on.

358
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,320
 Is there any version  of this conversation

359
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,550
 where you guys don't sound   like my parents?

360
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,520
I don't know. Is there any version

361
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,590
where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?

362
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,650
 That's exactly what   my mom would say.

363
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,020
No. If I was your mom, I woulsay,

364
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,050
"We forbid you from seeing this boy."

365
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,290
  (scoffs)  Lily!

366
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,390
No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.

367
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,590
  (teary):   This is my life!

368
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,120
 You guys just don't get it!

369
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,920
  You've never felt the way  that I feel!

370
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,450
 Now, now. We were once  young and in love, too.

371
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,590
  Yeah, like, a  billion years ago.

372
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,250
You've been drinking, haven't you?

373
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,420
 Yeah, we all have.

374
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,590
 You bought the  last round.

375
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,090
You're not going to that show tonight!

376
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,920
Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else?

377
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,450
  Tonight, after the show,

378
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,090
 Simon and I are going  all the way!

379
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,250
 (all gasping)

380
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,920
 Young lady, get back here!

381
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,230
(teary): Thanks for your help.

382
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,020
  Hey, so, today at work...

383
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,960
  Not now, Ted!

384
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,750
 Geez.

385
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,090
Ooh!

386
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,520
Oh, hey, Simon.

387
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,790
Great show.

388
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,450
You guys still rock.

389
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,950
  Yeah.

390
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,850
They totally dug my bass solo.

391
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,600
Man!

392
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,150
 Why can't I always   feel this alive?!

393
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,450
  God, I just love  seeing you so happy.

394
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,750
 Yeah. (laughs)

395
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,020
 About that.

396
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,760
 Listen, babe.

397
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,050
  It's over. What?

398
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,290
  I'm getting back together  with Louise Marsh.

399
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,290
 (laughing):  What?

400
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,930
 You're kidding me.

401
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,730
 You're breaking up with me?

402
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,750
Again?

403
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,150
 F-For the same ex-girlfriend?

404
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,350
  In the same van?

405
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,390
What is it?

406
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,650
 Her-Her parents got a pool?

407
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,220
  Is that still the reason?

408
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,800
Well...

409
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,450
I'm sorry, Robin.

410
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,650
  I'm fine, really.

411
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real.

412
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,120
Simon's a dawg.

413
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,450
 You feel me, Chelle?

414
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,050
Mm-hmm, for reals.

415
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,650
He a scrub.

416
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,020
Mm. True dat.

417
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,900
I'ma get me my champagne  and grape soda on.

418
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,120
So, how's Columbia?

419
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,390
Great!

420
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,190
I'm almost done  with my disstation.

421
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,250
Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in  behavioral psychology.

422
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,120
Um, can I make an observation?

423
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,450
Oh.

424
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,650
I know.

425
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,090
  Whenever I'm around Lily,

426
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,920
 she just brings out   that side of me.

427
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,750
 There's a psychological term  for the phenomenon.

428
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,620
 Revertigo? No.

429
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,420
 Actually, it's associative  regression. You see,

430
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,620
 the neural pathways that...

431
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,520
 * 

432
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,450
  Oh, no, you did not just

433
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,650
 put on my jam!

434
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,520
 Oh. Put your hands up, girl!

435
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,760
Holla! Holla!

436
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,930
 NARRATOR:   <i>One by one,</i>  <i>we all had to go home.</i>

   <i>Soon, it was just Robin.</i>

438
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,450
BARNEY: All right.

439
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,990
  I can't find your video.

440
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,650
I've wasted three days tr...

441
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,990
 * 

442
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,990
What's the matter?

443

 * 

444
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,820
 Uh... Simon dumped me

445
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,490
 in his van after the show.

446
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,650
Yeah, Robin, that was,  like, ten years ago.

447
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,420
 No, tonight.

448
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,520
 Ooh.

449
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,650
 (laughing): Really?

450
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,820
Oh! Oh, come here.

451
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,190
(sobbing) Come here.

452
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,620
 * 

453
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,890
 It's just...

454
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,620
  when I was young,  I was so...

455
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,550
 vulnerable and-and open to things, you know?

456
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:18,090
And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again.

457
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,220
I wanted to be 16 again.

458
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,220
Robin, that is the stupidest thing

459
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,790
I've ever heard come out of your mouth.

460
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,750
You want to be 16 again?

461
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,550
I have watched your first

462
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,720
Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times,

463
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,550
and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend.

464
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,150
It's because you were totally, totally lame back then.

465
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,150
But now, come on. Pa-cow!

466
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,650
You're the most awesome person I have ever known.

467
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,690
Well, second most awesome.

468
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,490
  Right. Of course, the-the first being you.

469
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,890
No.

470
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,650
No. The first is this guy

471
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,950
who lives in a place called the mirror.

472
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,890
(laughs) What up.

473
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,320
Oh.

474
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,720
I'm saying

475
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,820
that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.

476
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,390
 * 

477
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,550
 Barney, do you want to  come back to my place?

478
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,220
Your place?

479
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:16,960
 * 

480
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,990
Are you sure you want to do this?

481
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,090
Yeah. I am.

482
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,620
 Let's just not tell anyone   about this, okay?

483
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,960
 Of course.

484
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,690
 So, should I just put it in?

485
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,730
Yeah, why not?

486
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,560
  (sighs)

487
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,350
 (instrumental intro  to pop ballad plays)

488
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,650
 * Met you at the mall... 

489
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,290
This was my big artistic follow-up

490
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,120
to"Let's Go to the Mall."

491
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,190
It kind of tanked.

492
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,120
* My friends said I was a fool 

493
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,520
 You're a fool.    <i>Shut up!</i>

494
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,690
Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm.

495
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,790
* 'Cause you were older and got kicked out of school *

496
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,450
You are so rad.

497
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,790
  * Together we we gonna  travel the globe *

498
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,220
 * From Alberta to Ontario 

499
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,590
 It's everything   I want it to be and more.

500
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,520
Oh, I'm so glad.  Mm-hmm.

501
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,120

508
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,350
Yeah.

509
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,990
 * It was the greatest   week and a half *

510
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,150

You know, if  you reedit it,

513
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,720
 there's a tampon commercial  in here somewhere.

514
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,190
  * On our favorite bench 

515
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,120

Do you seem how lame  you were back then?

518
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,250
Yeah, you're right. I was lame.

519
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,090
