1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,750
kids,everybody make mistakes

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,850
Take this girl Meg for instance.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,350
She made a mistake, a mistake named Barney.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,850
Yeah I thought I was gonna get married to my last boyfriend

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,250
but, boy, did that guy have commitment issues.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,850
That whole relaonship--

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,850
that's three weeks of my life I'll never get back.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,750
Well, I love commitment.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,650
I wish I could marry commitment.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,590
I met a girl last night.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,650
Really?

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,650
So perky and full of life and not at all fake.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,150
You're talking about her boobs, right?

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,150
C?

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,090
And that wasn't Spanish, that was cup size.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,750
What up?

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,750
So, these boobs... Hmm.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,190
paint me a word picture.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,150
All right, Ted.

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,450
Imagine the heads of two Irish babies. Mmm.

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,550
Let's call them...

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:46,650
and...

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,650
Please stop!

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,150
When you get married,

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,850
you start out growing certain parts of your life.

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,650
And for Lily and Marshall, those certain parts were,

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,650
for the most part, me

28
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,050
Why would you come in?

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,950
You hear me shaving!

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,850
I thought you were shaving your face!

31
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,750
Well, clearly I wasn't!

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,150
Oh! No, no!

33
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,750
Pay up! Ugh! pussy!

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,550
Guys,it's 3:00 in the morning

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,150
and it reeks in here.

36
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,250
Ted said it was okay.

37
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,650
Ah, hey, Marshall.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,650
You're still up?

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,250
Aren't you taking the bar tomorrow?

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,350
Discontent was bubbling under this surface,

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,650
until one day...

42
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,150
Ted!

43
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,250
How many times have I asked you to put the lid

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,950
back on the peanut butter jar?

45
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,350
It's this sort of incoiderate,

46
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,550
immature jackassery

47
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,150
that makes me feel like I'm living in the Realworld house,

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,250
and not the early years when they all had jobs

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,550
and social consciences.

50
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,350
I'talking about Hawaii and after!

51
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,150
I can't take this anymore!

52
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,550
ted, Lily and I are married now!

53
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,650
It's time! we're getting our own place!

54
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,750
Actually, I left the lid open. Sorry, baby.

55
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,250
But still,it was time to move forward.

56
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,350
So, they set out to find a new apartment to rent.

57
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,950
Hey, here's one.

58
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,550
Prwar building, recently renovated,

59
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,950
hardwood floors, tons of light,

60
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,250
two bedroom, two bath.

61
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,150
Oh, yeah, but that one's not for rent.

62
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,150
It's for sale.

63
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,150
Oh, right.

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,090
Kids, Uncle Marshall always like to say

65
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,150
that he had made three big mistakes in his life.

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,550
This was the first.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,150
Jump, you big chicken!

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,650
Jump! You afraidy cat!

69
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,150
Jump! Jump!

70
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,450
This was the second.

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,650
No!

72
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,450
And this was the third and biggest.

73
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,750
We should buy a place!

74
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,250
-What? -Baby,

75
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,350
real estate is always a good invesent.

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,150
It's not.

77
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,550
And the market is really hot rightnow.

78
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,450
It wasn't.

79
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,050
And because of my new job,

80
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,350
we are in such atrong place financially.

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,150
They weren't.

82
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,850
Because lily has a secret.

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,150
My name is Lily and I'm a shopaholic.

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,150
Hi, Lily.

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,550
Oh, you guys don't do that here?

86
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:55,950
Sorry.

87
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,150
Proceed.

88
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,350
I buy designer clothes and accessories that I can't afford.

89
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,150
I have 15 creditcards and they're all maxed out.

90
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,650
And no one outside of this room,

91
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,350
not even my husband, knows.

92
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,350
And I, I feel terrible

93
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,450
becaus all I want to do right now

94
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,050
is ask you where you got those shoes.

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,050
They're adorable.

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,050
we can't buy; we have debt.

97
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,550
Yeah, I know,

98
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,750
my student loans are pretty big.

99
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,850
I forgive you.

100
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:24,950
What?

101
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,190
Well...

102
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,650
I'm just saying as your wife,

103
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,650
you know I'm cool that you spent tens of thousands of dollar

104
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,050
on a brand name law school.

105
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,750
cause I know it make you feel good and pretty.

106
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,050
Let's just go take a look at this place.

107
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,250
Where is it?

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,950
Uh, it's in a neighborhood called..

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,250
Dowisetrepla?
Dowisetrepla?

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,350
Dowisetrepla
Dowisetrepla.

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,090
Oh, I see, you're not New Yorkers.

112
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,590
Oh, actually we live on the Upper West side, so...

113
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,990
No need to be emrrassed, listen,

114
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,650
here in New York we just shorten the names of all t ighborhos,

115
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,690
So, TriBeC Nolita--

116
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,550
oh, right.

117
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,050
Dowisetrepla

118
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,850
I'm, I'm from New York.

119
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,050
I know this nighborhood.

120
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,950
i am down in the D-town

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,050
Oh, well nobody calls it D-town.

122
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,550
Dowisetrepla

123
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,250
the up-and-coming neighborhood.

124
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,090
And I have to tell you, for the prices

125
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,390
you're not going to be able to find an other...

126
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,750
I'm, I'm gonna stop you right there.

127
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,490
Don't bother with the hard sell.

128
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,490
This place is, is way out of our price range,

129
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,550
and besides, we've only just started to looking.

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,150
Is what Marshall should he said.

131
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,050
I'm gonna stop you right there.

132
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,250
I love it!

133
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's get it!

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,250
thank you gays, for coming down here so quickly.

135
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,950
I've never been to this neighborhood.

136
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,250
kind of thought this part of town was water.

137
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,150
No, dude.

138
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,950
This is Dowisetrepla.

139
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,650
Dowisetrepla? Yeah.

140
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,250
Is that abbreviation for something?

141
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,150
He'from Ohio.

142
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,450
Dowiatrepla is th up-a-coming neighborhood. Oh.

143
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,550
I think this right the place where Lily and I start a family

144
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,650
I can see it now

145
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,350
Two three,four.

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,350
All right, bring it home, boys.

147
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,250
Sounds great, boys.

148
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,950
Who wants chocolate pancakes?

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,150
Thanks, Mommy!

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,350
Man,

151
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,150
life is gonna be sweet!

152
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,550
oh, my God, Lily, have you seen this kitchen?

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,550
I know. It's... Isn't it amazing?

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,950
-I just love it so... -What the hell are you doin

155
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,550
You can't buy this place.

156
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,850
Lily you have a debt the size of Mount Waddington!

157
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,850
Waddington?

158
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,590
It's the tallest mountain in Canada.

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,250
It's like 4,000 meters high.

160
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,050
Meters?

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,250
Don't let Marshall fa in love with this apartmt.

162
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,950
I know, I know, I know, I know

163
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,450
but what do i tell him?

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,050
I-I don't know, tell him,

165
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,950
tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted.

166
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,150
You really don'know Marshall at all.

167
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,750
So, uh, the owners,where are they? Oh.

168
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,150
-They're on vacation in France for two weeks. -I see.

169
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,450
Between you and me,

170
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,850
I'm also interested in the artment.

171
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,250
So is there any way I could come back later and check it out

172
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,950
while you're showing them other places?

173
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,250
The lockbox combination is 1421.

174
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,550
And heres my card.

175
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,950
Are you serious?

176
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,150
You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily

177
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,050
Ted, do you think I have no morals whatsoever?

178
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,750
I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment

179
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,950
so I can nail her once and never have to see her again.

180
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,050
I'm not a monster.

181
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,690
Now, listen I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you,

182
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,350
but there is one other couple that expressed very serious interest.

183
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,350
I see what you're doing here.

184
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,450
"Another couple."

185
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,250
Please

186
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,150
That crap is page one out of the Realtor's playbook.

187
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,750
And we're not buying it.

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,150
Is what Marshall should have said.

189
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,350
Another couple? No!

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,350
We want it. Sell it to us. We'll give you so much more money.

191
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,150
Oh Marshall, can I talk to you?

192
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,550
Marshall, I just...

193
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,350
I don't know if now is the right time to buy.

194
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,250
But we're not doing this for now,

195
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,650
we're doing this for our future.

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,050
Can't you imagine starting a family here?

197
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,650
Oh, Persephone!Oh Daphne!

198
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,350
These'll be perfect additions

199
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,150
to our upcoming mother-daughter exhibit at the Met.

200
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,550
Looks great, girls.

201
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,650
Who wants crapes of chocolate?

202
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,250
Merci, papa.

203
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,050
So... what do you guys think?

204
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,150
I love it, but Marshall,

205
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,150
I should have told you this long time ago.

206
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,250
We can't afford to buy an apartment.

207
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,950
because I have too much credit card debt.

208
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,550
I am so sorry.

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,150
Is what she should have said.

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,650
I love it. Let's get it.

211
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,250
Can we charge it?

212
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,090
To Lily and Marshall

213
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,350
and their momentous step forward into adulthood.

214
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,150
Cheers.

215
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,150
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Drink it!

216
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,050
Yes! Well done. Nice! Yeah!

217
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,250
Anything else?

218
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,050
Yes.

219
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,050
I've been staring at that thing for years.

220
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,750
Wendy

221
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,450
bring me the comically large bottle of champagne.

222
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,390
Really? Are you sure?

223
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,950
It's neve been refrigerated.

224
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,150
And I think at some point there was a fish in it.

225
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,550
Honey, once you've made the sale,stop selling.

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,550
All right, but you guys have to help me carry it.

227
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,190
All right, let's do it. Let'do this.

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,250
I know what you're thinking.

229
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,850
I should tell Marshall the truth

230
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,250
I've got the whole thing figure out.

231
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,950
We'll apply for the loan under Marshall's name,

232
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,150
and h'll never need to know.

233
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,450
And then in the meantime, I'll slowly work down debt.

234
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,950
Right after I furnish the apartment.

235
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,750
I saw this amazing leather sofa today.

236
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,350
You should be a reality show.

237
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,450
Nice! Nice.

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,550
Wait!

239
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,590
That cork is the size of a softball

240
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,250
and you're pointing it directly at Wendy the waitress's face.

241
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,850
Is what he should have said.

242
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,050
Now if you are thinking about buying an apartment,

243
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,850
it's always good to check the place out at night.

244
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,550
Welcome to my humble abode.

245
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,150
This place is so nice.

246
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,150
Ah, make yourself at home.

247
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,450
Please, get comfortable.

248
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,150
If you see something you like, just take it.

249
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,750
Who are these people?

250
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,450
Uh... that's my parents.

251
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,850
They're Asian.

252
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,150
Yeah.

253
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,190
They're a Chinese couple that wanted a white baby

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,650
It works both ways.

255
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,850
Cookie. Wow.

256
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,350
Did you make those?

257
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,350
You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen.

258
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,050
I feel so at home here.

259
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,150
I'm glad.

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,950
Sometimes, I don't.

261
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,050
A place like this really needs a lady of the house.

262
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,850
I know it's early to be thinking of you as...

263
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,150
Oh, God I'm freaking you out, aren't I?

264
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,250
It's just  you make me feel so safe.

265
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,550
I didn't...

266
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,150
The next day

267
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,250
Lily and Marshall went to the mortgage broker to get a loan.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,290
Hey, uh, can we get this in singles?

269
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,390
Before we get the apartment I want to put in a kiddie pool

270
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,550
and swim around in it naked.

271
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,890
Great, that is great

272
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,250
Thank you.

273
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,750
Thank you.

274
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,850
Okay! all right, back to business.

275
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,850
All right, Mrs. Aldrin, I'm going to need your social as well.

276
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,350
What? Why?

277
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,150
I mean, you already have Marshall's.

278
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,250
Yes, but since you're a married couple,

279
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,350
you'll be applying for a joint loan, so.

280
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,050
Well, can we just go ahead an do it in my husband's name?

281
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,350
He is the head of the household.

282
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,750
He earns the big bucks.

283
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,550
I mean, can women even own property?

284
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,500
Go ahead, just give him your social.

285
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,750
Okay my... my social is, uh...

286
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,350
Got it.

287
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,450
Let's see what kind of rate I can get you two.

288
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,080
Under six percent Under six percent.

289
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,880
Under six percent,please.

290
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,530
There we go Congratulation

291
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,030
You ve been approved for a loan

292
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,430
18%
at 18%.

293
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,630
No, way. That-that can't be right.

294
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,410
You' lucky to be getting mortgage.

295
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,280
Let's get out of here, Marshall.

296
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,260
Hold it, I-I don't undersnd.

297
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,400
did we do mething wrong or...?

298
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,880
You have quite a bit of debt.

299
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,340
My student loans.Great.

300
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,720
I thought we were friends.

301
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,780
You know what, it's fine

302
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,080
to penalize me for trying

303
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,460
to get an education and bud a career,

304
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,710
but I will not let you deprive my beautiful wife

305
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,250
of her dream home just because I...

306
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,110
Okay, actually, it's because of youwife's credit card debt.

307
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,570
Oh my God.

308
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,900
Marshall, there's something I have to tell you,

309
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,270
and I want you to hear it from me first.

310
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,590
Okay,  let me get this straight.

311
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,450
You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?

312
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,770
yeah, we spent the night.

313
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,070
Hey, look at you.

314
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,430
I'm wearing your bathrobe.

315
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,620
I hope you don't mind.

316
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,170
The only thing missing from that bathrobe

317
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,240
are your initials.

318
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
My mom's gonna be in town next week.

319
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,930
Is iokay if she stays with us?

320
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,410
Only if she sleeps in the bed

321
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,940
and I sleep on the couch.

322
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,330
You're so sweet.

323
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,110
I love you.

324
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,530
There, I said it and I'm not taking it back.

325
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,130
Oh, my God! I love you, too.

326
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,810
I'm finally not the first one to say it!

327
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,720
How about you get in the shower,

328
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,220
and I will make us some waffles.

329
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,590
Works every time.

330
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,290
Wait.

331
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,120
That time that you offered to walk my dogs

332
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,770
when I went to visit my dad in Vancouver...

333
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,010
Yup.

334
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,730
Is that why my Yorkie trembled

335
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,570
for like a week after I got back?

336
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,540
Yeah.

337
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,050
That little guy saw some stuff I'm not proud of.

338
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
-Wh.  -What?

339
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,140
There was a fight here.

340
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,850
What do you mean?

341
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,670
whenever Mshall anLily have a big argument, they always

342
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,810
leave a trail of evidence all over the apament.

343
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,510
Oh, god, here we go.

344
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,870
He had a detective club as a kid.

345
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,590
Uh, the Mosby Boys

346
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,130
cracked a lot of big cases

347
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,600
The Mosby Boys?

348
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,320
You mean you and your sister.

349
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,330
We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.

350
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,200
let me guess

351
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,610
it was in the garbage.

352
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,870
Why are you like this?

353
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,370
Anyway, this is serious.

354
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,930
I know Lily and Marshall.

355
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,490
All the tell tale signs are here.

356
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,300
Like this

357
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,580
-A water bott? -Don't touch the evidence

358
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,770
I got your back partner.

359
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,090
It's not stny water bottle.

360
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,130
Notice the label is peed off.

361
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,560
Lily always peels labels off

362
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,370
the bottle when she's feeling guilty.

363
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,350
This lab is not only peele off, but torn up

364
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,590
Oh, man, she must have done something bad.

365
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,290
Which means Marshall must have been really angry,

366
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,900
and when Marshall gets rely angry.

367
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,920
he eats.

368
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,880
Just as I suspected,

369
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Cherry Garcia.

370
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,940
Given the liquid consistency,

371
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,770
I place the fight between... noon and 1.

372
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,830
Ew, that was on the floor.

373
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,280
If you want to get to the bottom of this,

374
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,450
you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll-face.

375
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,620
Marshall stood here.

376
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,800
Eating and yelling, yelling and eating.

377
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,430
Lily stood here.

378
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,580
Crying.

379
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,810
Ew, Ted.

380
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,750
And thenarshall tried to

381
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,750
storm out...

382
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,360
but Lily went for the Hail Marpass.

383
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,390
Which would mean...

384
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,590
What do u think, makeup sex?

385
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,620
There'd be a bigger mess.

386
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,210
Tempted as he was, Marshall was still too upset.

387
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,330
He had to get out of here, any way he cld.

388
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
He chosehe doo

389
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,340
slamming it bend him.

390
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,760
Whh is why this picture is crooked.

391
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,540
Nice catch, robin.

392
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,080
I'll jus uh, take this down to the lab.

393
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,870
Now alwe need  a motive.

394
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,880
The milln-dollar question.

395
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,250
at were they fighting about?

396
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,300
I ow what they've been fighting...

397
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,830
Bup, bup, bu b, bup, bup.

398
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,930
There's only one possible conclusion.

399
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,260
Li and Marshall're fighting about

400
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,840
-peanut butter. -Ah.

401
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,920
Lily left the lid off...

402
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,550
and mashall blew heads

403
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,800
I know what they were fighting about,

404
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,790
and it wasn't peanut butter.

405
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,980
Robin, just... I appreciate your help,

406
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,400
but there's a reason you name is Robin, not Batman.

407
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,510
Just...

408
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,030
They were fighting because they didn't get the loan

409
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,120
and it's all Lily's fault.

410
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,600
Robin, just... What?

411
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,750
Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of Mount...

412
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,950
Rushmore

413
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,480
Nice try, Robin.

414
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,290
So, the next thing Lily did

415
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,370
was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about

416
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,000
the peanut butter.

417
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,680
Then she called him

418
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,960
to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is...

419
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,330
Greenstein and Lee, Divorce Attorneys.

420
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,000
This can't be happening.

421
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,310
They can't... get divorced.

422
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,290
Not Lily and Marshall, no way.

423
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,900
Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.

424
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,420
What do you mean? Well..

425
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,650
Marshall's gonna get you guys, Lily's gonna get me.

426
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,780
even if they did break up, that doesn't mean

427
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,820
we can't all ill hangout.

428
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,390
I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.

429
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,590
It's a little weird.

430
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,180
Yeah, it is. It's weird.

431
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,420
The world needs

432
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,850
Marshall and Lily... together.

433
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,640
I'm not crying, there's something in my eye.

434
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,450
They're back.

435
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,330
Hey, hey, guys.

436
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,600
We have annnouncement.

437
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,770
I know, it's a terrible idea.

438
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,000
You can't do it!

439
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,510
Just look at me.

440
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,090
I hit redial on the phone.

441
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,560
Divorce lawyers?

442
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,760
Oh, I should explain.

443
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,480
We got in a pretty big fight.

444
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,970
Yeah, I know.

445
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,650
Marshall stormed out.

446
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,260
I went, uh, to the bar.

447
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,460
still drinking that?

448
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,520
I paid for it.

449
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,250
And apparently money's tight now, so...

450
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,260
Listen, I've been thinking about this,

451
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,070
and I know there's no way to undo what I've done,

452
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,790
but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer.

453
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,050
What?! What?!

454
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:57,850
Oh no, no, no, no-no.

455
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,280
-What, you want a divorce now? -No.

456
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,710
I just mean on paper,

457
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,240
so that you can buy the apartment

458
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,980
-without my bad credit dragging us down. -Lily...

459
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,980
are you trying to kill me?

460
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,490
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part.

461
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,650
No, you shouldn't have

462
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,430
I love you, Lily.

463
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,210
I love you, too.

464
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,810
And I want us to have our dream home.

465
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,650
And, well, I don't know.

466
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,320
It seems like this is a way to do it.

467
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,410
So...

468
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,290
Marsllriksen,

469
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,990
will you divorce me?

470
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,060
That's the sweetest divorce proposal I've ever heard.

471
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,750
So is that a yes?

472
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,470
You can't sleep with other women though.

473
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,190
No, we're not getting divorced,

474
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,590
not even on paper.

475
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,630
When I married you, I married your problems, too.

476
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,070
The ones I knew about and the ones I didn't.

477
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,740
So, that was the deal.

478
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,890
We'll figure this out together.

479
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,720
Can I get you guys anything else?

480
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,200
you're not getting a divorce?

481
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,600
No. Wow, you guys

482
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,800
scared us. Oh, thank God.

483
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,650
Cause, I mean if you did,

484
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,660
then who'd be the lame married couple I get to make fun of?

485
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,220
Like, "Hey, Marshall, you married Miss Right.

486
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,400
You just didn't know her first name was Always."

487
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,370
That stuff is cold.

488
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,760
So, what's the announcement?

489
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,490
I just got off the phone with the Realtor.

490
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,770
We told her that, uh, because of our finances,

491
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,580
we're not getting the place.

492
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,940
It's just-- it's not the right time.

493
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,640
Is what Marshall should have said.

494
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,130
I just got off the phone with the Realtor.

495
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,010
We got the place!

496
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,300
We' re home on earth!

497
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,250
Are you insane?

498
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,790
Have you lost your mind?

499
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,010
Is what we should have said.

500
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,960
Yeah!

501
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,970
Aw! This is exciting!

502
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,690
Yeah. There it is!

503
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,470
Our new home.

504
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,030
Shall we?

505
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,190
We shall.

506
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,010
Oh! what a horrible smell.

507
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,300
It reeks.

508
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,540
Oh, that's just the plant.

509
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,630
Don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends.

510
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,140
Wh-What plant?

511
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,400
What are you talking about?

512
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,470
Don't you know?

513
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,550
Baby, this whole neighborhood is downwind

514
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,730
of the sewage treatment plant.

515
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,380
Wait... what did you just say?

516
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,310
I said, we're downwind of the sewage treatment plant.
