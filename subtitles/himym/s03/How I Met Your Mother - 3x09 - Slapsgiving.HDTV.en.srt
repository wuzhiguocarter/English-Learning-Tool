1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:03,562
<i>Back when we were dating
Robin and I have this running joke.</i>

2
00:00:03,664 --> 00:00:06,117
<i>We were the only two people in
the world who found it funny.</i>

3
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:09,065
No way.
March does not have 31 days.

4
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:11,723
Yes, it does.
Everyone knows that.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,592
It's like general knowledge.

6
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,872
- General Knowledge.
- General Knowledge.

7
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,273
<i>And we did it all the time.</i>

8
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:20,198
Isn't it sad?
I mean in 2007,

9
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:23,206
some countries actually still
condone corporal punishment.

10
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:24,650
- Corporal Punishment.
- Corporal Punishment.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,452
<i>Because once you start,
it's surprisingly hard to stop.</i>

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,119
Oh, man, I got a kernel
stuck in my teeth.

13
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,837
- Colonel Stuck-In-My-Teeth.
- Colonel Stuck-In-My-Teeth.

14
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,281
- Please stop!
- I hate you!

15
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:38,033
<i>But now, we were broken up,
so when Marshall said...</i>

16
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:40,852
But after the first year,
I get a major pay raise.

17
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:43,240
<i>We just let it slide.</i>

18
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:46,310
<i>You see, on the surface, Robin and I
looked like we were doing great.</i>

19
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:47,542
<i>But the truth is,</i>

20
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:50,470
<i>trying to be friends with your ex
is a lot harder than it looks.</i>

21
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,230
<i>You can't be as candid
as you used to be.</i>

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,450
So then this hot intern
leans over my desk,

23
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:56,742
I can totally see
she has a pierced...

24
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:01,221
Brosnan. Pierce Brosnan is my
favorite of all the Bonds.

25
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:05,703
<i>But most importantly, you can
never, ever be alone together.</i>

26
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:07,601
- I gotta go.
- I'm gonna go pay.

27
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:08,831
Peeing.

28
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:15,961
- I'm gonna help Marshall pay.
- I'm gonna help Lily pee.

29
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:19,843
How I Met Your Mother 3x09
<i>- Slapsgiving -</i>

30
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:31,532
All right, we have a turkey.

32
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,130
Yeah, we do.

34
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:36,482
Isn't this exciting? Our first
Thanksgiving together as a group.

36
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:38,792
Yeah, this is gonna be
the best Slapsgiving ever.

37
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:39,741
What?

38
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,843
I said this is going to be
the best Thanksgiving ever.

39
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:45,962
Yeah, this is going to be great.
Just the five of us, right?

40
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:48,142
Oh, uh, that reminds me,
I invited Bob.

41
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:49,060
Bob?

42
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:51,351
You've been on, like,
three dates with that guy.

43
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:52,822
We haven't even met him.

44
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:55,311
Well, he didn't have
anywhere else to go,

45
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,962
and I didn't know what to say.

46
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:59,090
- Is it really that big a deal?
- Yes.

47
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:00,951
This is our first Thanksgiving.

48
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:03,921
30 years from now, we're
going to look at the photos and say,

49
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:07,460
"Oh, there's the four people
I love most in the world.

50
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:08,540
And Bob."

51
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:11,491
I'm sorry, sometimes I forget
how seriously

52
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,323
you guys take
American Thanksgiving.

53
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,572
Real Thanksgiving happened
over a month ago.

54
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,171
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,960
Did you just say Canadian
Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,

56
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:23,020
"the real Thanksgiving"?

57
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:26,820
What do Canadians even
have to celebrate about?

58
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:32,483
Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates
explorer Martin Frobisher's valiant yet

59
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:36,040
ultimately unsuccessful attempt
to find the Northwest Passage.

60
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,461
Why are you guys even a country?

61
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,762
Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants
to come over early Thursday,

62
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:43,252
we can watch the
Slapsgiving Day Parade.

63
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,911
Well, there,
you said it again.

64
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,863
- Said what?
- Slapsgiving.

65
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:48,822
Oh, I guess I did.

66
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:52,661
You know why? I've invented
a new holiday: Slapsgiving.

67
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,680
It's the one day we set aside
each year to gather together

68
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,100
and give slaps.

69
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,491
<i>I should explain.</i>

70
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:00,372
<i>Kids, you remember
the slap bet.</i>

71
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,723
<i>A year earlier, Marshall
made a bet with Barney</i>

72
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:04,782
<i>and won the right
to slap him five times.</i>

73
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:06,863
<i>He had already used the first.</i>

74
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,121
<i>And the second.</i>

75
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,812
<i>But Marshall had something
special in store for the third.</i>

76
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:15,113
Slapcountdown.com.

77
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:17,580
No, no.

78
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:21,282
The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m.,
the day after Thanksgiving.

79
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:22,441
I counted it out.

80
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:24,292
How many days
are in October?

81
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,093
Uh, thirty.

82
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,430
Dude, I thought
we cleared this up last year.

83
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,643
I like Halloween very much.
Is nice.

84
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,323
- Is also tomorrow.
- Damn it!

85
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,401
Wait, you're gonna slap me
on Thanksgiving?

86
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:42,392
Slapsgiving.

87
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:44,262
That's not allowed.

88
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:47,031
Lily, you're the Slap Bet
Commissioner, is that allowed?

89
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,320
The hostess in me who's using
her wedding china for the first time

90
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,102
wants to say hell, no,

91
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:53,993
but yeah,
I'm going to allow it.

92
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,303
Well, you know what?

93
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,783
If you're trying to freak me out
about spending Thanksgiving...

94
00:03:58,825 --> 00:03:59,683
Slapsgiving.

95
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:02,333
At your place,
then you failed.

96
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,480
- Truth is, I'm not scared.
- Really?

97
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,442
Right. 'Cause you blew it.

98
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:09,583
The worst part about getting slapped is
not knowing when it's going to happen.

99
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:12,110
But now I know exactly when
I'm gonna get slapped.

100
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,143
So, you took
all the suspense out.

101
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,460
You showed your hand.

102
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:19,512
And Thursday at 3:01 p.m.,

103
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,693
your face is going
to show my hand.

104
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:26,741
Oh, there's Bob! By the way, heads up,
he's a little bit older than us.

105
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,850
- How old is he?
- He's forty-one.

106
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,381
Hey, Bob! Over here!

107
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:34,073
<i>Okay, kids, the truth is,
Bob probably looked like this.</i>

108
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:36,041
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

109
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:38,972
<i>But when your ex
is dating someone new,</i>

110
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,393
<i>your mind tends to
accentuate their flaws.</i>

111
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:43,160
<i>This is how I saw Bob.</i>

112
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,183
Hey, dudes, what's crackin'?

113
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:47,271
- Hey, man, how are you?
- Good to meet you.

114
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,051
Sorry I'm late. I just got off
the phone with my parents.

115
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,483
- Parents?
- They were totally on my case:

116
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,262
"What are you gonna do with your life?
You're forty-one."

117
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:59,510
And I'm like, "Chillax,
snowboarding is a legit career.

118
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:02,541
You ought to be stoked
I found my bliss."

119
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,232
And speaking of bliss,
sugar me, baby.

120
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:09,222
Let's go get a drink.

121
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:14,470
Wow! Unbelievable.

122
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,611
Robin is dating
Orville Redenbacher.

123
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:21,782
What are you talking about?
He's forty-one. He looks great.

124
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:25,012
Yeah, dude he's in pretty good shape.
He could kick your ass.

125
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:28,912
How are you guys not seeing this?
He's 150; Robin's 27.

126
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,521
Barney, come on,
what do you got?

127
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:32,690
Nothing but respect
for that man.

128
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:35,970
Oh, by the way, we're all baking
pies at Robin's tomorrow.

129
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:39,201
Marshall can't be trusted in the
apartment with pies overnight.

130
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:43,840
For the millionth time,
sleep-eating is a very serious

131
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,391
and delicious medical condition.

132
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,303
Hey, uh, what time are you guys
going to Robin's?

133
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,591
- 7:30.
- Perfect. Just to be safe,

134
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:53,430
I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.

135
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:54,431
9:30 pm

136
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:56,783
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

137
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,382
- Where are Marshall and Lily?
- Uh, they just called.

138
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,531
They're both super swamped
preparing for tomorrow.

139
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,943
- Is Bob coming?
- No, he went to see Green Day.

140
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,162
So it's...

141
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:16,812
- Just the two of us.
- ...just the two of us.

142
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:17,661
Making pies.

143
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,920
Pies. They're things that
friends make together.

144
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:20,862
- Yeah, they do.
- Yeah.

145
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,939
Yeah.

146
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:22,957
- Great.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:26,102
Great. Well, this is great.
It'll give us a chance to catch up.

148
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,241
Yeah.

149
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:33,123
- I'm going to make a phone call.
- I'll put it in the oven.

150
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:38,511
Hey, it's me. Listen, you have
to come over here and make pies.

151
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:40,393
Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.

152
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:42,181
Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver.

153
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:45,150
It's still kind of weird being alone
with Robin, but if you were here...

154
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:46,790
Hey, say no more.

155
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:49,091
I mean, when I pulled you out
of that burning wreckage,

156
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,630
I wasn't doing it to have
a battleship named after me.

157
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:55,050
But if you insist, yes,
I'll be there for the christening.

158
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,381
You're hitting on someone
right now, aren't you?

159
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:01,213
No, I'm not going to wear the medal
of honor. That would just be tacky.

160
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,051
So you're not coming
to make pies.

161
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:06,860
No, no.
Thank you, Mr. President.

162
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:08,373
Sorry.

163
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:11,740
<i>After a very long night, it was
finally the big holiday.</i>

164
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:13,522
<i>Sorry, the two big holidays.</i>

165
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,791
Oh, Marshall, are you working
on the cranberry sauce?

166
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:16,741
In a minute, baby.

167
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:18,651
I've only got so many hands.

168
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,780
You see what I got going on here?
They're turkeys, but they're also hands,

169
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,391
because later,
we're going to eat turkey...

170
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,592
and then I'm going to slap
you in your face.

171
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:31,380
Please, you took out
all the suspense.

172
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:34,980
In a horror movie, the killer does not
grab a bullhorn and announce,

173
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:38,131
"Attention unsupervised teens
here at the lake house:

174
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:41,480
"At precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna
jump out of that closet right there

175
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,051
"and hack you all up
with a machete.

176
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:44,913
P.S. Fire is my one weakness."

177
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,411
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, Happy Thanksgiving.

178
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:53,392
You, too.

179
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,601
- Is Lily in the kitchen? Great.
- Yep.

180
00:07:58,737 --> 00:07:59,522
- Marshall?
- Lily?

181
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:00,420
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh?

182
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:03,332
- Something really weird happened last night.
- Something really weird happened last night.

183
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:07,171
What do you mean
something weird happened last night?

184
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:09,011
You may not realize this,
but since we broke up,

185
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:10,932
Robin and I have never really
been alone together.

186
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:14,901
<i>So we're in the kitchen,
starting on the pies, and we realize,</i>

187
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:17,371
<i>we don't have a damn thing
to say to each other.</i>

188
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:20,331
I mean, you can't talk about
how close you used to be.

189
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:22,940
You can't talk about how close
you're not now.

190
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:25,501
You just feel like everything you say
is gonna make things worse.

191
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,592
Exactly. And you know why?

192
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:29,941
Because you don't want to hurt
someone you really care about,

193
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,712
especially around the holidays.

194
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,502
I mean, what decent human being
would want to cause

195
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,840
any kind of emotional
or physical pain...

196
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:38,343
You're still getting slapped.

197
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,051
I wanted to leave,

198
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,192
but I couldn't stick her with making
all the pies by herself.

199
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,122
She was exhausted.

200
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:47,383
I yawned like a million times
trying to get him to leave.

201
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,320
Yeah, some people
just can't take a hint.

202
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,370
By the way,
I'm really swamped in here.

203
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,332
I kept looking at the clock
and sighing... totally clueless.

204
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:58,032
I'm not sure I have time to mash those
potatoes, you're standing right next to.

205
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:01,253
Then Ted does the thing that he always
does when there's an awkward silence.

206
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,090
Yep. Masher's right there,
next to the pot.

207
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:05,980
He panics and says the first
thing that pops into his head.

208
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:08,722
Hey, did you know that
the first pies

209
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,420
in recorded history
came from ancient Egypt?

210
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:17,991
Remember last year's Thanksgiving,
when we had sex seven times?

211
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:21,243
- Ooh.
- Terrible.

212
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:23,422
What?!
I thought it would break the ice.

213
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:26,390
I'd already broken the ice
with my cool pie fact.

214
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,753
Then he makes it
ten times more awkward.

215
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,782
How do you respond
to something like that?

216
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,492
Did you know that the Egyptian
pyramids can be seen from space?

217
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:35,792
Probably?

218
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:40,920
- Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!
- Okay, um...

219
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:43,513
the pecan pie is gonna take
the longest.

220
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:46,040
Why don't we put
that one in first?

221
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:47,853
Pecan pie?
Why are we making that?

222
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,182
Um, it's my favorite.

223
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,170
- You're allergic.
- I know.

224
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,413
I just like smelling it.
It's like eating with your nose.

225
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:59,222
So we're making a pie for Bob.

226
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,261
Well...

227
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,151
yeah.

228
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:05,350
She's got you making pies
for this guy?

229
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,841
That is a real slap
in the face.

230
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:13,400
You know, you could have
just told me it was for Bob.

231
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:15,682
Yeah, I-I just thought
it might upset you.

232
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,761
Upset me?
Wait a second.

233
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:18,770
Do you think that...

234
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,922
...do you think
that I'm jealous of Bob?

235
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:27,570
I don't know. Is it so ridiculous
to think that you might be?

236
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:29,152
- Yes.
- Why?

237
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,443
Because he's
a thousand years old.

238
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,102
No, Ted, what are
you doing?

239
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:34,943
Right?

240
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:36,750
The only reason
I'm jealous of Bob

241
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:39,821
is that we can only talk about the first
Thanksgiving, but he was actually there.

242
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:40,641
Come on.

243
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,580
The only reason
I'm jealous of Bob

244
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,753
is because I heard Noah
gave him shotgun in the ark.

245
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,272
The only reason
I'm jealous of Bob

246
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:50,233
is that I'm just an architect,
but he discovered fire.

247
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,513
How do you top that?

248
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:54,461
He's 41! Why are you bashing
on him so hard?

249
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,690
I'm not.
I'm just joking around.

250
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:59,423
- That's what friends do.
- It's mean.

251
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:03,430
Well, how come we're all allowed to bust
on Barney when he dates some skanktron,

252
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:05,353
but when you sleep
with the Crypt Keeper's dad,

253
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:06,742
I'm not allowed to say a word?

254
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,603
First of all, Bob and I are not
sleeping together.

255
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:10,781
We're just dating.

256
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,933
Secondly, have I said
one word about

257
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:15,820
the parade of dubious conquests
you've been marching past me

258
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:16,823
the last few months?

259
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,911
One of whom got you
a butterfly tattoo?

260
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,083
And if you and I
are such good friends...

261
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,462
why is baking a pie for Bob
so weird?

262
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:24,991
Yeah, if you and I are
such good friends,

263
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,482
why couldn't you just tell me
that's what we were doing?

264
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:32,362
Okay, maybe we should talk about
this later. I-I should get going.

265
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,801
Well, what are we doing?
It's Thanksgiving.

266
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,170
I don't know. I'm sorry.
This is stupid.

267
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:39,320
I'm sorry, too.

268
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,392
Of course we're friends.
I'm glad we're friends.

269
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:42,400
Me, too.

270
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,891
You guys slept together last night?

271
00:11:53,976 --> 00:11:56,021
That is a terrible idea!

272
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,850
Horrible idea.

273
00:11:57,975 --> 00:11:59,920
Relapse five!

274
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:03,423
That's where we high-five,
then it's awkward for a little bit...

275
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,110
and then we
high-five again!

276
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:08,610
What the hell were you doing?
Let's review:

277
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:10,622
You and Ted broke up
six months ago,

278
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,490
- you're dating another man...
- You are correct, sir.

279
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,511
...who's coming to my
Thanksgiving today...

280
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:16,473
That is a truth-fact.

281
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:19,170
- ...an event Ted is also attending.
- Ka-blammo.

282
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:22,233
Why are you trying to destroy
American Thanksgiving?!

283
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:24,080
Lily, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

284
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:25,610
Bob and I aren't that serious,

285
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,593
and what happened last night
with Ted was a fluke.

286
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:31,553
Well, did you guys
at least talk about it?

287
00:12:35,657 --> 00:12:38,500
- There's office material I'd...
- I hear something burning...

288
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,440
Clearly, we need to ignore this.

289
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:43,240
Clearly, we need to talk about this.

290
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:45,471
- You know? To save the friendship.
- You know? To save the friendship.

290
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:47,433
- Hi.
- Hi.

291
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,301
- We need to talk.
- Stuffed mushroom?

292
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:51,282
We need to talk
about last night.

293
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:54,183
Did you know that some
mushrooms are carnivorous?

294
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:56,342
Probably... Not?

295
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:00,002
Ted, can we please
just deal with this?

296
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:02,710
- Look, I'm not mad. I just think...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

297
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,370
Why would you be mad, you started it?

298
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:05,153
What?!

299
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,551
- You're crazy!
- We called a truce,

300
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:10,352
we hugged, and when I tried to pull
away, you kept your hand on my neck.

301
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,622
Only because your hand
was still around my waist.

302
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:14,681
Oh, come on!
You leaned into it.

303
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,861
- I... leaned into it?
- Yeah.

304
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,592
You're like the crappy kid
in Little League

305
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,503
who knows he's not going
to make contact, so he just...

306
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:23,632
"Oops, I got hit by the pitch.
Better take my base."

307
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,290
Oh, that was you
in Little League, wasn't it?

308
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,212
My on-base percentage
was off the charts!

309
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,350
- I will have to...
- What have you always to...

310
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:30,352
Oh, no!

311
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,752
The slap-petizers.

312
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:33,810
You know what?
That's it!

313
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,970
This is Thanksgiving.
Solve this right now.

314
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,531
And if you have sex again,
neither of you gets dessert!

315
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:45,253
Oh, what the hell kind
of Thanksgiving is this anyway?

316
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:47,401
Um, most Thanksgivings.

317
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:50,230
Don't stress, baby. I'll try
to find us something relaxing.

318
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,930
Thanks, baby.
Ooh, some classical music, maybe.

319
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,782
Oh, my!
Look at that.

320
00:13:57,926 --> 00:14:00,770
That means we're in the final
hour of the countdown.

321
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,752
I'm not scared.

322
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:05,293
Then why is your
right cheek twitching?

323
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,023
Maybe it's because Future Me
slaps Future You so hard,

324
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:14,093
it reverberates back to the present,
shattering the time-slap continuum.

325
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:15,810
Please don't slap me.

326
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:16,931
I'm sorry, what?

327
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,532
Oh, God!
Don't slap me again!

328
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:19,992
I don't want to get slapped again,

329
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:22,461
and the first two times hurt
so bad, I don't like it!

330
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,453
I don't like it one bit!

331
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,543
I thought I ruined it by putting
a clock on it, Barney?

332
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:30,212
Well, you didn't ruin it;
you made it so much worse!

333
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:32,373
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

334
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,040
I've lost ten pounds;
my suits are wearing me.

335
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,782
You know what?
I'm outta here.

336
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,201
- Well, no, no, no. You can't leave.
- Why can't I?!

337
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,352
Nowhere in the rules does
it say that I have to sit

338
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,172
through sort of mental torture!

339
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:45,693
You are allowed to slap
my face, sir,

340
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:48,312
but you are not allowed
to slap my mind! Good day!

341
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,752
- But it's Slapsgiving.
- It's not!

342
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,831
It's Thanksgiving!

343
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:56,703
Our first one as a married couple,
as grownups...

344
00:14:56,878 --> 00:15:01,162
and you're not even trying
to be a part of it! None of you are!

345
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:02,642
So...

346
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:05,541
as Slap Bet Commissioner,
I'm issuing a ruling.

347
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:09,191
Thanksgiving is a day of peace.
There will be no slaps today!

348
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,661
- What?!
- Yes!

349
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:14,540
In your face! Not my face...
your face!

350
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,553
- What's up, dudes?
- Hey, Bob.

351
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:17,702
- Baby, please...
- No!

352
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:20,202
The Slap Bet
Commissioner's word is final,

353
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:23,430
so get in the kitchen
and mash some potatoes, now.

354
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,091
And for the rest
of the day,

355
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:30,500
we are going to enjoy
a civilized, grownup holiday.

356
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:33,581
Not too grownup.
I made Jell-O shots.

357
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,901
We's gonna get silly, bitches.

358
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:39,852
<i>Look at us!</i>

359
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,510
We can't be alone
together, can we?

360
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:44,741
Apparently not.

361
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:46,981
What does that mean?

362
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,031
We're supposed to be friends.

363
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:53,032
We aren't friends, are we?

364
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:56,561
Not really.
We avoid each other.

365
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,560
We smile politely.

366
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,353
We're two people
who pretend to be friends

367
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,271
because it would be
inconvenient not to.

368
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:08,461
Well, maybe we should stop
pretending.

369
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:11,642
Maybe we should.

370
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:19,891
So...

371
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:22,091
Oh, what do we do now?

372
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:27,081
I suppose... we eat dinner.

373
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:32,992
And then that's it.

374
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:36,800
Okay.

375
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:51,360
Happy Thanksgiving.

376
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:57,743
<i>So we sat down to our first
Thanksgiving together as a group...</i>

377
00:16:57,946 --> 00:16:59,653
<i>and, apparently, our last.</i>

378
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:03,681
Marshall, you're not eating.
Did something spoil your slap-petite?

379
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:08,131
No, I just thought...

380
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:10,730
before we eat, maybe the chef
would like to say a few words.

381
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:13,571
Nope. This sucks.
Eat up and leave.

382
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,753
Well, then,
I'd like to say something.

383
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:22,081
If that's cool?

384
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,712
Today, Lily did something great.

385
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:30,853
Not only did she gather us all here
together and cook a delicious meal,

386
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,611
but she also started
a new tradition.

387
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:36,820
We're gonna do this again next year,
and the year after that

388
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:38,931
maybe for the rest of our lives.

389
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,812
I think that's pretty amazing
if you think about it.

390
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,070
And it's all thanks
to you, Lily.

391
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:45,653
I love you.

392
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:48,803
So, to the first of many
Thanksgivings together.

393
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:57,592
This is rad!

394
00:17:57,918 --> 00:18:01,092
A nice, small,
simple Thanksgiving.

395
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:04,020
I'm the youngest of ten
in my family,

396
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,341
so our Thanksgiving is
a mess.

397
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,200
All the yelling
and the screaming...

398
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,023
<i>And then a funny thing
happened...</i>

399
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:14,363
It's really a major buzz-kill.

400
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,711
- Major Buzz-kill.
- Major Buzz-kill.

401
00:18:19,286 --> 00:18:23,593
- Oh, no...
- I thought we were done with that?

402
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,021
I guess we're not.

403
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,612
Guess we're not.

404
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:33,761
<i>You see kids, friendship
is an involuntary reflex...</i>

405
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,953
<i>it just happens,
you can't help it.</i>

406
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,460
<i>That first Thanksgiving turned
out to be a wonderful dinner</i>

407
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,001
<i>with the four people
I love most in the world...</i>

408
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:42,531
<i>and Bob.</i>

409
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:44,601
<i>And it did become a tradition.</i>

410
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:48,373
<i>That's why every year, we go to Aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.</i>

411
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:49,710
Hey, check it out!

412
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:53,693
We're in the last 20 seconds
of Marshall's countdown to nothing.

413
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:55,131
Barney, put it away.

414
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,861
How does it feel, Marshall,
to sit there, impotently...

415
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:01,483
your large, flaccid hand,
just dangling in the wind?

416
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,090
<i>The slap will occur in ten...</i>

417
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,042
Ooh, classy touch, dude.

418
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:07,172
Too bad!

419
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:10,121
- Barney, put it away.
- I will in... five...

420
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,952
- ... four...
- You can slap him.

421
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,982
- What?! Wait, you...
- ...two... one.

422
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:16,551
That's three!

423
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,701
Thanks, baby, you're the best.

424
00:19:19,748 --> 00:19:23,230
And as a special, added bonus, I've
composed a song just for this occasion.

425
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:24,773
Ted, lights!

426
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:40,082
# What is this feelin' #

427
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,563
# That's put you in your place? #

428
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:49,162
# A hot, red burnin' on the side #

429
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:51,021
# of your face #

430
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:54,781
# You feel the blood rush
to your cheek #

431
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,392
# Tears start to fill your eyes #

432
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:01,532
# And your lips are tremblin'
but you can't speak, #

433
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,760
# you're tryin' #

434
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:07,142
# Oh, you're tryin' not to cry! #

435
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:10,992
# - Ya just got sla-apped
- Oh, oh! #

436
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:14,030
# - Across the face, my friend
- Oh, oh, oh #

437
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,712
# You just got slapped #

438
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:19,193
# - Whoa-oh-oh-oh!
- Yes, that really just happened #

439
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:20,873
# Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! #

440
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:23,273
# Everybody saw it #

441
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:27,600
# And everybody laughed and clapped #

442
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:29,671
# It was awesome #

443
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:32,282
# Wait, you just got... #

444
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:34,792
# Slapped. #

445
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,121
Happy Slapsgiving, everybody.

446
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:54,500
Well, guys, have fun.

447
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,243
Wow, this gonna be
a major clean up.

448
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:58,721
- Major clean-up.
- Major clean-up.

449
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:02,913
Oh men, we're gonna to be doing this
all the time now, are we?

450
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,463
That's the general idea.

451
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,880
- General idea.
- General idea.
