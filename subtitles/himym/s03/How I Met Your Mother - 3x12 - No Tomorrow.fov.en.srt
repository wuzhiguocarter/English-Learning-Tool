1

You know why it's lucky

13
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,190
Because it's green.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,740

00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,940
With caffeine.

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,780
Day by myself.

44
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,520
I don't need you people.

45
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,440
You make me physically ill!

46
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,540
He did look a little green.

47
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,990
Hello?

48
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,030
Hey. happy st. patty's day.

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,590
How are you? I've been talking to you forever

50
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,590
-Who is it? -it's ted's butt.

51
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,220
Damn it!My phone keeps pocket dialing.

52
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,520
That's like 8th times today.

53
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,820
In fairness I did call

54
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,900
Ted's butt about 2:00 this afternoon.

55
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,730
Just long enough to call you back.

56
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,150
Barney?

57
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,820
Where are you.

58
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,770
In a cab, heading downtown with our hot and

59
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,170
Sexy dates for the evening.

60
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,850
Yes, it happens that fast!

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,110
You're coming with us.

62
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,500
For the last time.

63
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,590
All right,

64
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,480
I didn't want to tell you this

65
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,360
in front of marshall and Lilly

66
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,730
They are old and married and it's too late for them anyway

67
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,010
but ted, the world is

68
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,980
Going to come to an end tonight.

69
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,450
Yes, think about it.

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,590
End of the world, Nostradamus£¬notre dame,

71
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,790
Fighting irish.

72
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,950
Irish, st. patrick's day.

74
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,250

75
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,120
Apocalypse now.

76
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,340
bro?megandon

77
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,340
You are young, you're single.

78
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,040
You will have so much more

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,680
Fun with me.

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,860
Do you want to spend your

81
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,700
Last night on earth playing

82
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,620
Board games with marshall and lilly?

83
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,860
My hands smell weird.

84
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,610
Smell this.

85
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,820
They do, that's new.

86
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,530
I'll be there in five minutes.

87
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,240
Yes all right!

88
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,980
He's in.

89
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,180
Ted is a great guy.

90
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,860
You're going to love him.

91
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,170
So on march 17 2008, I went

92
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,740
To a big st. patrick's day party.

93
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,970
And it's a good thing I did

94
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,200
Because funny story,

95
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,240
Your mother was there.

96
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,500
Hi,have you med ted.

97
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,610

98
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,410
Hi, happy st. patty's day.

99
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,770
I haven't met ted either.

100
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,000
-I'm stefanie. -Hi

101
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,860
Dude, back off. I called this on stefanie.

102
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,200
Okay, mary's hot .

103
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,870
Well then I want mary.

104
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,450
Fine.

105
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,070
Oh, I see reverse psychology.

106
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,280
Then I'm sticking with

107
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,680
-Stefanie dr. frid. -Ok

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,790
Which one do you want more.

109
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,290
Either one.

110
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,060
I want them both.

111
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,880
You're an idiot.

112
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,690
It may be a moot point.

113
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,460
It doesn't look like we're getting in.

114
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,260
Look at this.

115
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,050
You know why there's a line,

116
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,660
it's  because i ditched marshall and lilly

117
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,800
And now the universe is

118
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,810
Punishing us for it, that's why.

119
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,860
What's it going to cost us

120
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,080
To get in, $20?

121
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,580
$40.

122
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,730
Dude come on, you're making the we folk look bad.

123
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,030
just give me your pot of gold.

124
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,190
Is it just you two?

125
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,570
Don't worry we're not gonna blow your race here.

126
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,790
We happen to have two very hot girls with us.

127
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,510
Mine is the hotter one.

128
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,950
Sorry guys, if it was

129
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,890
Just you two, you can go in

130
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,820
Right now.

131
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,140
We have nothing but girls in there.

132
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,190
People will start thinking it's a lesbian bar

133
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,360
Would you excuse us for just a minute?

134
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,990
Ted I'm going to be honest

135
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,750
I was full of it with

136
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,740
that Nostradamus thing

137
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,680
but I'm starting to think there's

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,980
Serious planetary crap going on here tonight.

139
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,820
Never in the history of new

140
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,060
York city nightclub has

141
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,310
There been a shortage of dudes.

142
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,340
Not even during the great

143
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,260
Dude shortage of 1883.

144
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,200
We've got to ditch these girls.

145
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,750
You dragged them all

146
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,600
The way down here.

147
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,330
I don't see no ring on this finger.

148
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,460
Hold on.

149
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,250
Excuse me.

150
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,840
Are the girls in there

151
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,160
Hotter than our dates?

152
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,540
I don't know if they're hotter

153
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,020
But they're drunker.

154
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,770
Rock and roll.

155
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,780
Welcome to your new dream home my lady.

156
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,950
All right, all right.

157
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,050
Put me down, robin thinks we're weird.

158
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,550
No it's fine,

159
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,790
it was only weird on the subway.

160
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,410
I'm going to check the other rooms to see if

161
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,610
The previous owners left us any free stuff.

162
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,950
I'll hang our first piece of art,

163
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,530
There's already a nail,

164
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,570
hey lily, free nail!

165
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,260
score!

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,780
-How's that. -perfect.

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Now this is ridiculous

168
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,820
Is it the nail?

169
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,500
-Marshall  -Is the wall cookt crooked or something?

170
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,460
-Marshall  -Is there a draft in here.

171
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,560
Marshall,

172
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,340
what?

173
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,740
Your apartment is crooked.

174
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,480
What do you mean?

175
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,380
It was the kind of thing

176
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,370
You didn't notice Until you noticed it.

177
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,170
and once you noticed it, you couldn't not notice it.

178
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,410
Lilly an marshall's new apartment

179
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,420
Was crooked.

180
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,250
Oh, no!

181
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,200
No, no!

182
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
Oh,no, no!no, no!

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,070
Yes.

184
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,760
Are you telling me that

185
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,750
We just spend our entire

186
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,780
Life saving on a crooked apartment?

187
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,590
Oh my god

188
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,310
Oh,she's gonna fret

189
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,290
Look what I found in the

190
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,580
Kids' room, free skateboard,

191
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
Score one

192
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,260
Free hungry, hungry hippo.

193
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,140
Double score!

194
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,940
I'm going to check the kitchen

195
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,780
How can she not notice.

196
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,280
It's like the last 20 minutes of titanic in here.

197
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,360
We have keep this quiet,

198
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,500
If lilly finds out her dream house crooked

199
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,260
It will break her heart.

200
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,230
Free salad Strainer.

201
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,100
I love this place

202
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,640
Just for tonight, okay?

203
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Ok

204
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,280
It's going to be an uphill battle.

205
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,190
I'm just saying we have to

206
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,790
Think of the right angle.

207
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,450
I have a third one but I'm

208
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,300
Not going to say it.

209
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,090
I think we've stumbled

210
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,930
Into some sort of ethical Worm hole.

211
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,030
-Green suit -yeah

212
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,990
I ditched marshall and lilly

213
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,430
And was rewarded with two beautiful girls.

214
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,420
Suits made of green.

215
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,840
We bailed on those two beautiful girls

216
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,910
and now we're

217
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,910
Being rewarded with a sea of Beautiful girls.

218
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,860
38 long.

219
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,120
Like the laws of the

220
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,810
Universe are working in reverse.

221
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,890
Can you put it on my tab.

222
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,780
What's the last name.

223
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,730
Guido.

224
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,420
I'm going to try something to see if this works

225
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,570
-hey  -hey what kind of do you get?

226
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,700
A bottle of dom perignon.Can you put it on my tab.

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,410

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,180
Oh,hello

232
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,540
St. patrick's tradition

233
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,130
If you're not wearing green,

234
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,410
You have to get punished.

235
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,110
well this is what i deserved

236
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm not wearing green either.

237
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,330
This is deep teal the

238
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,640
Lighting makes it.

239
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,740
I'm Ted

240
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,280

You guys can join me and friends.We have a bottle of Tequila

Okay, it's official, do

245
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,420
Bad things, good things happen.

246
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,780
Ted, listen, are you hearing that?

247
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,810
That's the universe.

248
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,580
The universe is talking to us.

249
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,270
We don't have to build a baseball field, do we?

250
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,100
No the universe is

251
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,290
Telling us that we have a free pass tonight.

252
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,860
The universe is saying that

253
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,400
We don't have to live in

254
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,360
Fear of the -- are you still there?

255
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,310
Yeah, I'm still here.

256
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,190
For the repercussions of our actions.

257
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,560
There is no waiting for tomorrow

258
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,630
because do you know why ted?

259
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,490
There is no tomorrow.

260
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,700
No tomorrow, huh?

261
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,390
By the way mr. garido,

262
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,060
With your champagne you get

263
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,770
A free complimentary caviar.

264
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,390
Enjoy.

265
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,790
Not tomorrow

266
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,790
Not tomorrow

267
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,790
Hey wonder what the

268
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,010
Grown-ups are doing right now?

269
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,750
I win again!

270
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,740
Why do I keep winning?

271
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,940
Maybe your hip spoe just

272
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,870
Hungrier than ours.

273
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,730
That's it.That's what is.It's not gravity

274
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,890
that's for sure. I'll tell you that.

275
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,250
What's that?

276
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,530
What's going on here?

277
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,130
Okay, lilly.

278
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,220
While you were in the other

279
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,790
Room, robin and I

280
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,170
We discovered something about this apartment

281
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,860
It's not a big deal.

282
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,600
It's not like a disaster,

283
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,180
It's just something that

284
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,030
We're going to have to learn to live with.

285
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,460
Robin and I saw a ghost.

286
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

287
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,980
He's kidding, right?

288
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,450
No, we really saw a ghost.

289
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,140
What did it look like?

290
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,320
A sheet with two holes

291
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,300
He was a Confederate general

292
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,410
Who was wounded at the battle of Antietam

293
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,150
and died at the army

294
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,830
Hospital which once stood on this very spot

295
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,120
And now he wanders these halls

296
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,520
vowing revenge against the union he once failed in

297
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,210
But he seems nice. good guy.

298
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,130
You see ghosts everywhere.

299
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,040
You see ghosts at starbucks.

300
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,760
That kenny g holiday cd

301
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,670
Just flew off the shelf.

302
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,710
Last time that happened.

303
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,940
Robin you're a skeptic so if

304
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,840
You say you saw a ghost,.

305
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,240
It passed right

306
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,870
Through me and suddenly i

307
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,260
Felt cold.

308
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,820
So very coal. cold.

309
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,060
You know ashley, you

310
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,900
Probably just want to get up

311
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,230
And walk away but I just

312
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,090
Have to test out this theory

313
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,120
I've been working on.

314
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,220
Tonight, I'm not looking for

315
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,070
A relationship.

316
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,940
I really just want to hook

317
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,750
Up with you, leave before

318
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,200
Breakfast and never see you again.

319
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,010
I'm in.

320
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,830
Unbelievable.

321
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,830
Hot damn, that's a deep naval!

322
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,980
No tomorrow ted!

323
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,310
No tomorrow barney.

324
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,870
No tomorrow, huh?

325
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,030
I like that idea.

326
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,140
Because if there is a tomorrow,

327
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,030
I'm going to be in

328
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,710
A lot of trouble.

329
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,340
Why is that?

330
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,880
I'm married.

331
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,730
Tell me you're messing

332
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,500
With me guys.

333
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,700
You didn't actually see a ghost

334
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,120
it's not a big deal baby.

335
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,150
He seemed friendly.

336
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,270
You said he's a Confederate general,

337
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,460
they're the bad guys.

338
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,200
And he's probably racist!

339
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,390
He seems polite.

340
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,720
He has courtly southern manners.

341
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,170
How can we bring our kids here.

342
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,280
I don't want a confederate general ghost teach them  racism!

343
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,450
He loves people of all colors and creeds.

344
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,520
He was fighting for state rights.That's all.

345
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,570
You have said he was wearing a sheet,

346
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,720
what do you think that means?

347
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,410
The apartment is crooked!

348
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,760
What?

349
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,670
Robin and i

350
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,480
Didn't see a ghost.

351
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,650
The floor is crooked, isn't it?

352
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,780
Yeah.

353
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,690
We spent our entire

354
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,180
Life savings on this particular.

355
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,640
The next 30 mortgage paying

356
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,020
Years of our lives will be

357
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,100
Spent on a floor an it's crooked!

358
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,430
Thanks a lot, robin.

359
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,570
How is racist

360
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,570
Ghost bear than crooked?

361
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,940
Someone tell me how that's better.

362
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,960
That's okay.

364
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,630
So I'm having second thoughts about that theory.

365
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,300
I'm telling you if you want to know how old a woman

366
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,530
Is check her elbows.

367
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,700
Not that theory.

368
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,330
You have to be More specific,ted

369
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,330
Because I have so many theories.

370
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,760
The whole do bad,good things happen.

371
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
Asheley is married.

372
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,830
So?

373
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,200
What do you mean so?

374
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,530
Open your brain tank,

375
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,900
Because here come fromPremium 91 octane knowledge.

376
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,300
There's three rules of cheating.

377
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,300
It's not cheating if you're not the one whose married.

378
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,830
It's not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels

379
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,080
And it's not cheating if she's in a different area code.

380
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,570
You're fine on all three counts.

381
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,450
How do you know she's from a different area code.

382
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,510
She's 516

383
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,730
She may dress like 718,she might act like 212

384
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,430
But trust me,she is 516

385
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,200
Oh and her husband

386
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,490
Letting her out alone on st.Patty's day

387
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,030
if that guy is not 973, I'm 307.

388
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,730
Wyoming.

389
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,220
Maybe we can nail down all our furniture.

390
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,380
We won't be able to get a pinball machine.

391
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,290
Unless we put a book under two of the legs or something.

392
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,730
But if we wanna read those books.this is a nightmare.

393
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,210
Can't raise our kids here.

394
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,620
They will grow up slanted.

395
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,160
If we have a daughter,

396
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,410
we have to call her ilene.

397
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,010
I don't think we can live here marshall.

398
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,710
I don't know what we're gonna to do.

399
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,730
Marshall?

400
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Open the door.

401
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,920
If I make to it the door

402
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
That's five points.

403
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,310
Woo-hoo!

404
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,680
Yeah!

405
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,390
Five points.

406
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,590
10 bucks says I can do it backwards.

407
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,100
So lilly and marshall

408
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,120
Decided to make the best of A bad situation

409
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,290
and that's also how the apartment roller luge was invented.

410
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,550
Very careful,very,oh, yeah!

411
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,620
So she's married.

412
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,450
Not like she has kid.

413
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,430
How do you know?

414
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,690
Wrist!It's like you don't even listen to me.

415
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,130
Oh, hey.

416
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,820
Hey.

417
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,450
Where did you go.

418
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,200
Well, I just.

419
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,950
Was it something I said.

420
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,850
No,no,no,it's just...

421
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,270
Well, you're married and

422
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,990
We've been drinking and i was worried we might...

423
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,110
This is a very bad idea.

424
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,810
We have a problem

425
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,530
Hey, hey, hey.

426
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,280
Is this your husband.

427
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,100
I've never seen him in my life

428
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,200
Ok,what's our problem

429
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,790
Rick,Rick garido

430
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,230
According to the bar tenor

431
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,480
I'm the guy who has been

432
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,290
Buying you shall pain all night

433
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,030
Ok,there's a very simple explanation

434
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,090
The next thing I know is the police show up,

435
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,030
They arrest the other guy

436
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,370
and I'm drinking for free the rest of the night

437
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,790
It was awesome

438
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,880
Awesome?

439
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,160
Yeah

440
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,480
You don't see anything wrong with that story

441
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,420
Well I lost my phone in the club somewhere

442
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,490
What the hell is wrong with you,dude?

443
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,270
I lose things

444
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,690
You kissed a married woman ted

445
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,180
You committed credit card fraud

446
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,600
You kissed a married woman

447
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,290
Do you know how offensive that is to me?

448
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,870
You're turning into barney

449
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,190
We don't need another barney

450
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,150
It's st. patty's day!

451
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,350
It wasn't as bad as it sounds

452
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,410
It wasn't as bad as it sounds?

453
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,920
Huh? okay.

454
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,290

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,240
I don't see no ring on this finger

458
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,370
And then last night

459
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,760
Started coming back to me

460
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,080
The real version

461
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,330
Are the girls this there hotter than our dates?

462
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't know if they're hotter,

463
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,540
but they're drunker.

464
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,740

470
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,060
Sir, what's the last name?

471
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,390
Garido.

472
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,000
And then someone opens your eyes a bit

473
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,200
And then you realize

474
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,940
Next message

475
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,840

477
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,540
Never see you again

478
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,500
Your whole world is off balance

479
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,970
Next message

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,530

481
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,070
Ok,look,bro,there's a very simple explanation

482
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,010
Crooked

483
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,990
That was hard to listen to

484
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,230
No one sounds good in answerign machine

485
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,350
Thanks for doing that

486
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
You yelled at me

487
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,370
You got very firm with me

488
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,820
Very confident

489
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,400
It was cool

490
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,580
Thanks

491
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,630
You're very sexy when you yell marshall

492
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,340
Shut up

493
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,890
Crazy muscles in your neck

494
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,630
You're like the kentucky derby,winning streaks

495
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,830
You're ruining our last moment

496
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,180
At one point I thought we were going to kiss

497
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,360
Ted seriously

498
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,230
I'm married

499
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,830
A slanted floor

500
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,890
Architecturally speaking

501
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,790
Fixing that will be

502
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,690
Very very

503
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,390
Very expensive

504
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,990
And it's going to take some time too

505
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,160
So, looks like you're stuck with us for a

506
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,960
Little while longer if

507
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,990
That's okay

508
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,830
Are you kidding?

509
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,860
I love it

510
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,510
I don't know what's going to happen without you guys around

511
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,130
Where are you going

512
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,900
I'm going to get my stupid phone

513
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,240
So that was st. patrick's day 2008

514
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,090
I find out years later that your mom was at that party

515
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,730
I just didn't meet her

516
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,840
It's a good thing I didn't

517
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,250
Because if I had, I don't

518
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,070
Think she would have liked me

519
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,080
In fact I don't think I like me

520
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,590
But that's okay

521
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,020
Tomorrow had arrived

522
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,690
You see I didn't know it yet,

523
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,890
But my luck was about to change

524
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,990
I'm awesome!
