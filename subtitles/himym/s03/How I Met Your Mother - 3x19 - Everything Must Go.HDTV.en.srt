1
00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:02,466
<i>Kids, in the spring of 2008,</i>

2
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:05,196
<i>something kinda strange had been
happening to your Uncle Barney.</i>

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,103
<i>He'd be doing
great with a woman...</i>

4
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:09,620
So I throw the pressurized
oxygen tank in his mouth,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,181
I shoot the tank, boom!
No more shark.

6
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:14,568
Mr. Holland and I
swim back to shore.

7
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:16,333
Let me freshen your drink.

8
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:20,355
<i>He'd only be gone a few moments,
but when he returned...</i>

9
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:21,827
So where were we?

10
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:23,170
<i>...he'd get slapped.</i>

11
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:25,062
<i>It kept happening.</i>

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,099
<i>Until finally, Lily was approached
by a mysterious woman</i>

13
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:33,517
<i>who warned her
to stay away from Barney.</i>

14
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,072
<i>So when it happened once more...</i>

15
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:39,643
Again?! Really?!
Wait...

16
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,813
<i>...Barney knew who to look for.</i>

17
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:02,940
Hey, excuse me.

18
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,980
Did I sleep with you and
then totally screw you over?

19
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:06,462
No.

20
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,302
What are you doing on Friday?

21
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:20,062
Amy?

22
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:21,331
Abby.

23
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:25,022
Right.

24
00:01:26,518 --> 00:01:30,193
How I Met Your Mother 3x19
<i>- Everything Must Go -</i>

25
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:44,360
<i>Kids, sometimes you can do something
right a thousand times in a row...</i>

26
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:47,611
A rainbow!
That's beautiful!

27
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:51,563
What a beautiful rainbow!

28
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:56,691
Another rainbow?
It's beautiful!

29
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,310
<i>But then, that
thousand-and-first time...</i>

30
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:03,353
You're kidding me. Seriously,
aren't you sick of these things?

32
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:08,880
Hey, how was yo day?

34
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:11,663
Today, I yelled at a little girl
for painting a rainbow.

36
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:15,321
A rainbow? Sounds like
that bitch had it coming.

37
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,803
So, uh, I just met with
the contractor.

38
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,273
And it turns out, that fixing
the floors of the new apartment

39
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,213
is going to cost a lot more
than the estimate.

40
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:29,223
But we can barely
afford that to begin with.

41
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:31,061
I hate to say this,

42
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:33,473
but I think you're going to have
to sell your stuff.

43
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:36,931
Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game
we play in the bedroom.

44
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,850
I mean your clothes. All those
designer pieces and everything.

45
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,353
What?
Why just my clothes?

46
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:45,601
We can sell my stuff, too,
but I got to tell you,

47
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,830
I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress
is going to go for a lot more than my

48
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,981
- "Split Happens" bowling shirt.
- Dude.

49
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,630
I'm not selling that.

50
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:57,563
- I've already made the Website.
- You made a Website?

51
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:03,043
Yeah, it's called "Lily-and-Marshall
-sell-their-stuff-dot-com."

52
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:07,082
No, you know what would be
a better name for the site?

53
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:14,513
Guy-forces-his-wife-to-dress-in-a-garbage
-bag-for-the-next-three-years-dot-com.

54
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,392
That's real.

55
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:21,771
Now I'm worried. That woman is actually
wearing a garbage bag.

56
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,771
Hmm, but, girlfriend,
you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.

57
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:29,133
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?

58
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:31,441
Well, you slept with me and
then you never called me again.

59
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,033
- And?
- That's it.

60
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:35,253
That's it?

61
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,692
As far as I'm concerned,
if I leave you safe on dry land

62
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:40,372
with adequate transportation home,
you've got nothing to complain about.

63
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:42,112
Well, it hurt, okay?

64
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:45,441
And then Ted, the love of my life,
started dating my boss instead of me.

65
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,132
Do you know how that feels?

66
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:50,252
Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.

67
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:52,381
- Abby!
- Abby.

68
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:55,711
A few weeks ago, Ted
dumped me as his wingman.

69
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,963
You had a crush on him
for a couple weeks?

70
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:00,272
I was Ted's best friend
for seven years.

71
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:03,220
- Ted said Marshall was his best friend.
- Seven years!

72
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:04,892
Sorry.

73
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,233
Ted.
What an idiot.

74
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:12,022
With his stupid "meaningful
relationship" with Stella.

75
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,272
- Ted.
- Ted.

76
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:16,911
- I hate Ted.
- I hate Ted more.

77
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:20,392
- Are you as turned on as I am?
- Probably not quite as much.

78
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm sorry I yelled out "Ted."

79
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,090
I'm sorry I yelled out "Abby."

80
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,552
I am Abby.

81
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,422
Oh, cool.

82
00:04:32,746 --> 00:04:33,882
This is insane.

83
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,841
Has Lily even worn
half this stuff?

84
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:38,762
Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your
closet you've never worn?

85
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:40,950
As a matter of fact,
no, there isn't.

86
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:43,183
Whatever, red cowboy boots.

87
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:46,063
Those are nice boots.
I totally pull those off.

88
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:50,590
If I were to say
"Ted could never pull them off,"

89
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,743
- what would I be talking about?
- His red cowboy boots.

90
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:56,360
I totally pull them off!
It's a classic Western look.

91
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:59,083
Oh, okay, uh, today's category:

92
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,703
classic Westerns that involve
red cowboy boots.

93
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:04,440
Robin.

94
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:06,623
"The Good, the Bad,
and the Fabulous."

95
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:10,250
"The Magnificent Kevin."

96
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:13,702
"No Country for Straight Men."

97
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,843
I don't want to sell my clothes!

98
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,873
I know, sweetie.
Come here.

99
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,263
Is this a hundred percent silk?

100
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,740
Lily, listen,
we really need the money.

101
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:29,611
I have some leads on a job,
but until then, I just...

102
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,232
I don't know what else
we can do.

103
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:34,653
I'll sell my paintings!

104
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:36,061
What?

105
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:38,071
Yeah, I'll sell my paintings.

106
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:40,703
Good oil paintings go for like, $500.

107
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,202
Yeah. Totally.

108
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:44,350
But...

109
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:47,833
<i>Kids, sometimes you can do something
right a thousand times in a row...</i>

110
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:49,203
I love it.

111
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:51,030
It's a masterpiece.

112
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:54,873
That's it.
We're selling the TV.

113
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:57,342
I just want to come home
and stare at this all day.

114
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:00,591
Somebody call the cops!

115
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,710
My wife stole an awesome painting
from the museum!

116
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,803
<i>But then, that
thousand-and-first time...</i>

117
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:11,361
...that kind of money
only goes for real paintings.

118
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:14,980
What does that mean?

119
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:20,422
Look, it just means that we need money
right now and I'm not sure that

120
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:22,780
selling your paintings
is how we're going to get it.

121
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:24,933
You don't believe in me.

122
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:28,453
No, wait, wait!
Of c...

123
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:30,030
of course I believe in you!

124
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:32,803
Marshall, I am proud
of my work as an artist.

125
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:36,122
My paintings are good.
I bet Robin would buy one.

126
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:37,331
What now?

127
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:42,173
I love your painting, I just...
I'm trying to be realistic.

128
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,263
Well, how much money do we need
for the contractor to finish the job?

129
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:47,813
About 1,500 bucks.

130
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:53,323
So, if I can sell three of my paintings
at 500 bucks a pop, then

131
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,241
I get to keep all my clothes.

132
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,122
- We need money fast.
- Well, give me a week.

133
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,321
Okay, a week.

134
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,691
- Fine.
- Fine.

135
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:05,152
Fine.

136
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:20,510
Pulling. Them. Off.

137
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:28,410
<i>Lily's first move in the great
art challenge of 2008</i>

138
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:31,743
<i>was to display one of her favorite
paintings at her friend's gallery.</i>

139
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:33,481
<i>The night didn't go so well.</i>

140
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,512
<i>But then at the last minute...</i>

141
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,653
- I love it.
- You do?

142
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:46,802
Your top. It's gorgeous.
Is that 100% silk?

143
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:49,900
It's not for sale!
My clothes are not for sale!

144
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:52,752
<i>So the next day, Lily took
her painting to a coffee house</i>

145
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,539
<i>that displayed local artists.</i>

146
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:58,627
We've been sitting here for hours and
nobody's even glanced at my painting.

147
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,962
Come on.
Let's start talking it up.

148
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:05,132
I really like that painting!

149
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,910
It's neat!

150
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,110
The-the colors are neat.

151
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:10,891
The-the shapes are neat.

152
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:14,033
It's really just... neat.

153
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:16,903
What?

154
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,271
Observe.

155
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:23,591
I think there's a dynamic quality
to the brushwork that,

156
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,452
combined with the fluid composition,

157
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:28,490
creates an almost
Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.

158
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:34,490
Yes, and you can still enjoy it
even if you're not a pretentious douche.

159
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:38,201
Can you clarify something
for me about your critique?

160
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:41,581
Are the colors "neat" or
are they more "neato burrito?"

161
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:45,590
Uh, then again,
red cowboy boots.

162
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:50,260
I pull these off!
I pull these off!

163
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,821
You know what
I hate most about Ted?

164
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:53,762
What?

165
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,950
His stupid hair.

166
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:58,812
His stupid, lame awesome hair.

167
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,481
It's so stupid and awesome.

168
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:05,023
You know what
I hate most about Ted?

169
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:05,782
What?

170
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:09,850
How he's always like, "Oh, I want to
fall in love and have a relationship.

171
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:13,413
I care about the people I have
sex with." He's so lame.

172
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,242
He's so lame and awesome.

173
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,322
You know what he needs?

174
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,751
He needs to see just how horrible
he is when he's in a relationship.

175
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:26,541
Yeah, and I need to show Ted
that I'm over him.

176
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:28,710
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

177
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:30,841
I think so.

178
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:33,222
You're thinking
of having sex with Ted?

179
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:39,832
<i>After four days without selling a single
painting, Lily was getting desperate.</i>

180
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:43,040
Painting for sale!
$500!

181
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:46,023
Lifelong dream
hanging in the balance!

182
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:50,042
It's like they don't even see us.

183
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,993
Yeah, we're dirt to them.

184
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,163
What do you need money for?

185
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:57,302
Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood
floors in my new apartment.

186
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:58,283
You?

187
00:09:58,716 --> 00:09:59,832
Heroin.

188
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:05,792
- Do you like heroin?
- Love it.

189
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,963
If you sell that, I'm going to take
your money and go buy some more heroin.

190
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,573
Thanks for your honesty,
Crazy Sock Guy.

191
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,352
- Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...
- It's not very good.

192
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:22,771
<i>And just as she was about
to lose all hope,</i>

193
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:24,663
<i>something amazing happened.</i>

194
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,021
Oh, my God!

195
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:31,341
500 bucks! Who's a real
painter now, Marshall?

196
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:33,533
Honey, I never said
you weren't a real painter.

197
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,262
I know, sweetie.

198
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:38,380
And since I'm a
professional artist now,

199
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:41,021
I'm going to sketch you
an Aldrin original,

200
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:44,520
you know, to say thanks for being
such a supportive husband.

201
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,510
I'm thinking about calling it...

202
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:47,830
"Suck It!"

203
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,751
Lily, come on. I'm proud of you.
Who-who bought it?

204
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:55,212
Well, that's the best part.
A gay couple without kids.

205
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,011
A G-CWOK!

206
00:10:57,276 --> 00:11:00,051
- You bagged a G-CWOK?!
- Yeah, that's right.

207
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,901
They are the heart and soul
of the art-buying community.

208
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:05,410
You know what you should do?
You should call up the G-CWOKs

209
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,810
and offer them a free painting
if they throw a private art party

210
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:09,530
for all their G-CWOK friends.

211
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:12,601
That's an amazing idea.
I'm going to go call them.

212
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,911
I can probably sell two more
paintings with time to spare.

213
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:20,051
Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something
I had to tell you. What was it?

214
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,552
Oh, that's right.

215
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:22,701
Suck it.

216
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:31,261
Hey.

217
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,260
Ted, fancy bumping
into you here.

218
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,672
Have you guys met
my girlfriend Abby?

219
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:40,353
- Uh, yeah. Hi, Abby. So...
- Hello, Abby.

220
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:42,320
So you guys are dating now?

221
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:43,391
That's right.

222
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:46,131
I am done with this
whole being awesome thing.

223
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:48,612
Now I'm all about
farmers' markets and

224
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:51,940
day hikes in matching khaki cargo
shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?

225
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:54,971
That's right.
And girlfriends are lame.

226
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,451
Unless they're me.
I miss you, Ted.

227
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,700
Abby and I are in love.

228
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:03,020
Not hot passionate love.

229
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,433
Couple love.

230
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,912
You know, movie night
with my girlfriend,

231
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,682
then waiting for her
to go to bed

232
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:11,631
so I can steal one pitiful moment
of hollow ecstasy

233
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:14,130
by the cold, blue light
of my computer monitor.

234
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:17,601
We're showing Ted
how lame he is.

235
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:19,812
You don't have to say it, though.

236
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,970
Uh, okay, Barney,
you can stop.

237
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,322
Stop what, Ted?
Stop being in love?

238
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,603
Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.

239
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:30,371
We can't stop breathing, Ted.

240
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:32,153
Your hair looks amazing.

241
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:36,731
Barney, I, I see what you're doing.
Please stop.

242
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:40,950
Not before I share with you what
being in a relationship leads to, Ted.

243
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,081
Abby, Pookie Bear...

244
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:48,701
I am so pathetically
desperate for you, that...

245
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:51,092
aw, heck, I'll just say it.

246
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:57,340
- Will you marry me?
- Wait, really?

247
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,552
I would never joke about true love.

248
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,161
- Yes, I'll marry you.
- Okay.

249
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,890
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,312
I have to call my mom.

251
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:12,773
That's you.

252
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:16,450
Uh, yeah, I don't think
Abby knows you're kidding.

253
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,113
Uh, yes, she does.

254
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:20,301
It finally happened, Mama.

255
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,110
I just wish Daddy were alive
to walk me down the aisle.

256
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,491
Totally committed to the bit.

257
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:30,753
Yes, Lily Aldrin.
I sold you the painting earlier today.

258
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,433
Oh, honey, hello.

259
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:33,753
You sound happy.

260
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,093
Are you kidding? We're popping
the champagne right now.

261
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:40,263
Well, I just wanted to offer you
an exclusive chance

262
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:42,340
to view some of my other paintings.

263
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:46,602
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh,
I guess I should have told you.

264
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,510
We just bought that for the frame.

265
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,110
What?

266
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:52,002
Yeah, it's an original
Anton Kreutzer,

267
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:54,021
a very rare frame
from the turn of the century.

268
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:57,653
So... you didn't like my painting?

269
00:13:57,857 --> 00:14:00,861
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie,
no, not at all.

270
00:14:01,537 --> 00:14:03,830
But you know,
good for you.

271
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:10,682
Well, if you didn't want
the painting, can I...

272
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:13,011
can I at least get it back?

273
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:15,672
Yeah, no,
we don't have it anymore.

274
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:17,210
Where is it?

275
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:20,491
I see.

276
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,763
H-He threw out my painting.

277
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,680
Champagne for everyone,
on me,

278
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:30,312
the happiest guy in the world.

279
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,591
Ginger ale.
It's a bit.

280
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,020
This is great.

281
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,160
My dream of becoming
an artist is dead,

282
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:45,161
and now I'm watching my wardrobe
disappear piece by piece.

283
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,682
There goes my favorite dress.

284
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:50,322
This dress meant a lot to me.

285
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,522
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:57,043
It was spring of 2004 and
I had been having a hard few months.

287
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,110
Day-am.

288
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,853
I got a two-syllable "damn"
in this dress.

289
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,183
A two-syllable "damn."

290
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,472
- That's the dream.
- Yeah.

291
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:15,850
Now she belongs to...
CanadaGirl@MetroNewsOne.com.

292
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,602
It's still in the family.

293
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:21,360
Lily, you're not going to believe this.

294
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,281
- Something amazing happened.
- What?

295
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,540
I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.

296
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:26,870
Really? Why?

297
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:28,532
Because I felt guilty.

298
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,631
This auction was my idea and now
you've had to sit around all day

299
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:36,000
while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly
pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.

300
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,111
It's still in the family.

301
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,852
And more importantly,

302
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,901
I honestly love that painting and

303
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,632
I couldn't stand to think of it
in a trashcan someplace.

304
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,352
Well, what happened?

305
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,111
Well, hello.

306
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:55,460
Hi, um... Lawrence. I'm here about
the painting my wife Lily sold you...

307
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,421
the one in the nice frame.

308
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:01,513
Talk about a nice frame.
My, my, you are a big one, aren't you?

309
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:04,361
And you're married to that little bit
of a thing. How does that work?

310
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,351
I'd like to find out.

311
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:09,042
Yeah, we get it.
Gay guys like you.

312
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,040
No, Lily,

313
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:13,761
they love me,
but that's not the important part.

314
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,530
Here's the important part.

315
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:18,741
Since you're clearly a man
of impeccable taste and style,

316
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:20,683
I came down here to ask you:

317
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:23,872
what do you think of the boots?

318
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,182
Boots.

319
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:38,520
Pulling. Them. Off.

320
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,762
I'll be in the cab.

321
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:49,741
G-CWOK-approved.

322
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:51,070
The painting.

323
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:54,583
Right, so, um, they told me they
threw it in the building's Dumpster.

324
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,851
<i>It wasn't in there, but the super
told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer,</i>

325
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,382
<i>a veterinarian who
works in the building,</i>

326
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,041
<i>take the painting out of the trash.</i>

327
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:06,393
Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer and
why did he take my painting?

328
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:08,532
You're about to find out.

329
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,460
Long story short,
I had to make a trash run.

330
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,263
Been a busy day...
lots of neuterings.

331
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,551
Ooh, we don't need the details.

332
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:17,361
Oh, no no no,
it's not what you think.

333
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:20,171
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly
just dog testicles. Anyway...

334
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,990
<i>I noticed your painting</i>

335
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:27,400
<i>just sitting right there on top
and I thought, "Hey, free painting,"</i>

336
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:31,830
<i>so I brought it upstairs and
hung it up in Exam Room 3,</i>

337
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,340
<i>and then the strangest
thing happened.</i>

338
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:38,411
Hey, Muffin.

339
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,710
Whoa, I think he remembers me
from the last time he was here.

340
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:47,412
Take Muffin to Exam Room 3.
I'll meet you there.

341
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,921
<i>I went in, expecting the worst.</i>

342
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:56,531
<i>I'd never seen Muffin that calm,</i>

343
00:17:56,896 --> 00:18:00,880
<i>and then a little later the same thing
happened again with Tidbit...</i>

344
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:03,150
<i>and King Larry...</i>

345
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,393
<i>and again
with the Weinstein triplets.</i>

346
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:11,653
Something about your art

347
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,983
speaks to the canine sensibility
on a very primal level.

348
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:18,282
- Really? Dogs like my paintings?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:21,083
But you know who it bums out?
Birds.

350
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,832
Had a parrot in there today.
He took one look at it,

351
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,043
pried open his cage,
flew right into the ceiling fan.

352
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,301
Anyway, because your first
painting worked so well,

353
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,470
I convinced Dr. Greer
to buy four more.

354
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:39,243
- Really?
- At $500 a piece.

355
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:42,300
That's two grand. That's more
than we need for the contractor.

356
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,890
Yeah, but I was actually
thinking we could reinvest it.

357
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:46,653
- In what?
- In you.

358
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,542
<i>Marshall explained that
he was building a fancy new Web site

359
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:57,323
<i>specifically to sell
Lily's artwork to veterinarians.

360
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:02,331
Well, it's not exactly
the clientele I had in mind, but...

361
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,463
thank you for believing in me.

362
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:14,193
Man,
birds do not get you.

363
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:26,352
Hi, sweetie.

364
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,212
Hey, I think I left my tie here.
Have you seen it?

365
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:31,003
No, I'm in wedding-planning mode.

366
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:33,782
Stressville. Population: me.
Okay, big decision.

367
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:37,282
What do you think the cake should be:
Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?

368
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:41,123
Yeah, that was a bit.
We were doing a bit.

369
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:44,471
So I'm thinking Labor Day.
I was going to say Fourth of July,

370
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:48,040
but I don't want to steal
any attention away from America.

371
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:52,381
Abby, I've...
I've got some bad news.

372
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:55,421
- I can't marry you.
- What?

373
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,910
Ted begged me not to.
I think he's in love with you.

374
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,672
- Really?
- Yes, our plan worked,

375
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:05,061
better than we ever dreamed.
You have to go to him.

376
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,363
Here's his home address.
But you know what? He works late,

377
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,733
so I wouldn't go before
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

378
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:15,990
Oh, my God, thank you.
But now I feel wrong keeping this.

379
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:19,411
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.
That's made of candy.

380
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:20,840
Later.

381
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:30,900
Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com
or charityfolks.com.

382
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,641
We're having an auction
to raise money

383
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:34,402
for the children's hospital
of Los Angeles.

384
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:37,402
You can get a tone of cool stuff from
the show and it's all for a great cause.

385
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:38,790
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
