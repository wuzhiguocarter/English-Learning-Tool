1
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,370


2
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,770


3
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:25,070


4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
kids£¬back in 2007, it seems like everyone belonged to 

5
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,370
these silly things called gyms. 

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,210
The idea was you'd pay them lots of money  

7
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,810
to run around and lift heavy things.

8
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,040
biggest rip-off in the world   

9
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,480
and yet people fell for it. 

10
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,450
including me.  

11
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,510
oh, forgot my wallet  

12
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,950
it started with one of those moments  

13
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,350
when you realize you're not as in shape           

14
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,350
as you want to be.    

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,490
ah, it's further than it looks.  

16
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,090
aw, coupon's on my dresser.  

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,590
that's too far. forget it. 

18
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,700
Please don't judge me. 

19
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,730
I winded up with shame eating the whole pizza.  

20
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,240
I woke up all greasy and sweaty.  

21
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,370
my sheets looked like what they wrap deli sandwiches in. 

22
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,540
maybe I should join a gym.  

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,980
you go to a gym?  

24
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,780
Well, I go to Total Rib Fitness, but I don't work out there.

25
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,580
What do you do?         

26
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,250
I invest.  

27
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,920
There goes one of my ivestment now. 

28
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,320
cheryl, hard work's pay it off.  

29
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,220
Keep up the good work. 

30
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,830
So your investments are women?  

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,830
Yeah 

32
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,030
Women who, how shall put this delicately       

33
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,300
They fat.      

34
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,400
So, I come here,  

35
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,200
give them lots of attention now.  

36
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,040
Then when they get hot, who's the first guy they run to?  

37
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,540
The one who invested in them when they weren't 

38
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,710
Wow, I can't decide if I'm thoroughly disgusted  

39
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,910
or really, really impressed    

40
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,820
of courese, not all investments pay dividends.

41
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,750
see the girl over there vending machine-- toya.

42
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,720
she is one kit kat away from junk bond status.

43
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,620
hey,barney.

44
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,020
becky, elliptical machine's

45
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,290
really working for you. nice stuff.

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,830
that one's going to reward shareholders soon.

47
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,640
i forsee aggressive growth in my future.

48
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,570
what up?

49
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,340
wow,that makes me want to join a gym.

50
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,840
so i can get super strong

51
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,540
and punch you really hard in the face.

52
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,280
yes, we should all do it.

53
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,180
yeah, let's all punch barney in the face.

54
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,250
no, I'm serious.

55
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,920
We should totally join a gym.

56
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,250
come on,we put on 

57
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,390
under beer weight together--

58
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,720
we might take it off together.

59
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,290
or we could just stop drinking beer.

60
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,090
no. i say we join a gym.                      

61
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,730
-are you marshall?  -yeah.

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,100
hi, i'm tresh.

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,470
I'm the trainer you signed up for.

64
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,530
oh,hi.

65
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,900
really great

66
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,300
to meet you, tresh.

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,270
it's a pleasure.

68
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,510
marshall, can i talk to you for a second?

69
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,310
-sure. -great

70
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,040
just a second

71
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,780
ah, sweetie, i think

72
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,520
she maybe just a little too hot to be your trainer.

73
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,280
I get it.

74
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,790
i mean, i see what you're worried about.

75
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,520
but this just about me taking care of myself.

76
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,190
you'll always be my sugar.

77
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,130
so,Marsll, are you ready

78
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,160
to make a commitment to your body?

79
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,830
pssh! please, i'm all about committing to my body.

80
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,240
i'll drive to Vermont and have a commitment ceremony

81
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,740
to my body if you want.

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,470
that was a weird thing to say.

83
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,340
all right. start with 100 push-ups.

84
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,610
-all right,cool. how many do you want me do? -100.

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,950
oh,i thought that was a figure of speech--100 push-ups,

86
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,480
like do a bazillion push-ups.

87
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,220
no one can do 100.

88
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,650
do you smell that?

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,090
no.

90
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,760
it smells like there's a little bitch in my gym.

91
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,230
are you being a little bitch in my gym?

92
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,690
no.

93
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,230
then get on the floor and give me 100!

94
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,230
you don't have to yell at me.

95
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,970
i love it here.

96
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,770
It's just normal women who want to get in shape.

97
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,400
i don't have to put on makeup,do my hair,

98
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,240
wear some trendy outfit.

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
yeah,this place is great

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,740
we're meeting our friend Robin here.

101
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,010
i hope you don't hate her. she's pretty hot.

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,350
shut up.

103
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,080
lily,tell him to shut up.

104
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,020
i'm sorry, lesbian prison guard, do we know each other?

105
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,920
ted, lily, you'll never believe what just happened.

106
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,160
oh, hey, dude, i'm barney

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,260
so i was at the oothie bar...

108
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,260
what can i get you?

109
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,470
oh, my god, Rhonda?

110
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,170
it's Barney.

111
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,940
barney stinson from statensland boulevard.

112
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,240
hey,barney stinson from  stateniand boulevard.

113
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,340
what can I get you?

114
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,280
i can't believe she didn't remember me.

115
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,210
why? who is she?

116
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,780
that's Rhonda

117
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,650
i lost my virginity to her.

118
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,840
baby,are you still sore?

119
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,810
tresh made me do 70 push-ups,

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,680
but she only gave me credit for ten.

121
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,820
then she had me do 100 sit-ups

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,420
and then she made me cry, using only her words.

123
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,390
it just doesn't add up.

124
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,990
how could Rhonda not remember me?

125
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,730
well,maybe it wasn't that good for her.

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,100
i mean,it was your first time.

127
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,030
Ted, it's me.

128
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,070
i rocked her world.

129
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,500
you don't believe me? okay,story time.

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
the year was 1998.

131
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,740
i'd been going out with shannon since freshman year of college.

132
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,780
we were saving ourselves. 

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,180
so when  broke up 

134
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,850
there i was, 23 and still a virgin.

135
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,150
i knew nothing about girls.

136
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,980
so i wento the guy

137
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,150
who knew everything about girls-- my brother james.

138
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,090
wait,your gay brother james?

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,020
yeah,this was before he was gay.

140
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,430
barney...

141
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,600
barney,you need to find a girl

142
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,270
and have sex with her asap.

143
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,010
that is what dudes do after a breakup.

144
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,980
i know i want to,but... i guess i'm just scared.

145
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,210
of course you're scared.

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,880
it's gross.

147
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,150
the thought of doing that with a woman.

148
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,090
but it part of being a guy.

149
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,220
try thinking  about baseball.

150
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,690
somehow i imagine those players on the field

151
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,030
and it's over a lot faster.

152
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,930
but i don't know the first thing about seducing a woman.

153
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,230
what do you...? how do you...?

154
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,270
where do you...?

155
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,600
stop. don't overthink it.

156
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,200
you don't want to get the yips.

157
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,240
the yips?

158
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,340
yeah,when you overthink simple things so much

159
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,540
that you can't do them at all.

160
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,980
the yips

161
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,850
yeah,it happens to athletes all the time.

162
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,850
like the second baseman who suddenly can't throw to the first

163
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,550
or the figure skater who does a perfect triple toe loop

164
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,020
and then loses it on the arabesq.

165
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,290
i've actually really been getting into

166
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,760
figure skating lately.

167
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,960
but james...

168
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,330
what woman's gonna have sex with me?

169
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,070
it not like i'm a backsreet boy

170
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,040
the man maker.

171
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,910
rhonda man maker french

172
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,140
was our mom's friend from down the street.

173
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,210

174
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,210

177
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,120

178
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,960
i let him snake my drain,  if you know what i mean.

179
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,990

180
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,730

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,410
so i'm doing sit-ups

261
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,650
and she says,"all right,marshall,

262
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,180

263
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,480
so i summon all my strenght and do that set,

264
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,520
and then she says,

265
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,020
"give me another set."

266
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,250
so i'm like,"is this the last set?"

267
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,320
and she says yes.

268
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,860
so i do that set and then she says,

269
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,760
"give me another set."

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,080
and you need to find that woman

363
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,650
and you need to earn it with her for real.

364
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,950
That is the only way how you can find yourself.

365
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,830
I see little hamburgers!

366
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,900
i love little hamburgers.

367
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,260
Aufwiedersehen.

368
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,900
I just made out with Heidilum.

369
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,170
What?

370
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,510
Ted,just... okay?

371
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,680
Come in.

372
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,510
Hi,Rhonda.

373
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,450
Hi,kiddo. Surprised to see you here.

374
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,590
So,hey,uh,maybe,how about sex?

375
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,620
Let's sex.

376
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,430
What are you talking about? I'm watching Wheel of Fortune.

377
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,430
You can keep watching. I'll face you toward the TV.

378
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,360
That's a cute idea,kid.

379
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,330
Great.

380
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,370
No,I'm not having sex with you.

381
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,440
Sit down a minute.

382
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,140
I'm not the Man Maker anymore

383
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,570
You know what?

384
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,710
About five years ago,

385
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,440
I realized there was an emptiness inside of me

386
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,080
that no amount of meaningless sex could fill.

387
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,750
I needed something more.

388
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,520
And that's when I discovered Indian casinos.

389
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,820
Hey,Barney,

390
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,430
it's weird not seeing you in a suit. What's going on?

391
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,160
Uh,not much. My entire sexual history

392
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,770
was built on a rotting foundation of lies.

393
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,600
My whole identity is lost in a pit of menthol ashes.

394
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,670
Work is good

395
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,550
I'm never going back to that gym again.

396
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,880
today at work, I had to have an intern

397
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,920
rip up my bagel and put little pieces in my mouth.

398
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,560
Yeah,I'm done there,to

399
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,890
That place is horrible.

400
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,090
what about your big muscular trainer

401
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,400
who's so into stretching you out?

402
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,260
Yeah,well,turns out

403
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,140
that guy had no affiliation with the gym whatsoever.

404
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,900
Come on,guys,don't give up on the gym.

405
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,970
It's been great for us.

406
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,480
Like today Robin and I had a really nice moment.

407
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,830
Robin,hey, I just wanted

408
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,490
to come over and thank you.

409
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,330
Thank me for what?

410
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,130
Well,you know how it's hard for exes to friends

411
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,540
because there's this lingering sexual tension between them?

412
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,500
Gone. Thank you.

413
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,080
You know,for all the crap you' given me

414
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,950
I haven't seen you work up a sweat there once.

415
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,280
It's not true.I was there today.

416
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,410
Yeah,but didn't you leave early

417
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,460
Oh,great

418
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,830
now I gotta go home and charge this

419
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,500
Wait a minute.

420
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,930
You didn't work out Tuesday either.

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,470
Brought the wrong shorts.

422
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,070
Yeah,and you totally disaeared on Monday,too.

423
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,110
No,I was at the gym the whole time.

424
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,250
Ooh! Oh,I love this gym.

425
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,650
Lily,help me bend down these three fingers.

426
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,890
Actually,I have an idea.

427
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,520
Do it! Come on! Do it,you worthless piece of crap!

428
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,790
Please! Please,I just want to go home.

429
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,490
Come on.This is your last set!

430
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,500
You said that last time!

431
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,040
Gone.

432
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,910
Rhonda.

433
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,580
I saw your friend Ted at the gym.

434
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,520
After he puked and cleared the line at the smothie bar,

435
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,420
he said you were kinda having a tough time.

436
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,490
Did you change your mind about having love,making sex,

437
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,690
penis vagina?

438
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,630
What is the matter with me?

439
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,460
Oh,honey...

440
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,460
I just,I don't get it.

441
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,030
You slept with so many guys.

442
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,370
You slept with my brother.

443
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,170
We are practically the same person.

444
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,070
Was I really so bad?

445
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Nobody's good the first time.

446
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,410
But I was. At least I thought I was.

447
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,450
Oh,Barney,you know what,sex isn't everything.

448
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,290
When is the last time you had a convsation

449
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,460
with woman with no intenon of score in with her?

450
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,360
I sat next to former Secretary of The State

451
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,960
Madelee Albright at a benefit once.

452
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,900
I certainly did't intend to hit that.

453
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,470
Yeah,well,I'll tell you what.

454
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,970
Sleeping with me again isn't gonna solve anything.

455
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,510
I don't know what else is.

456
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,410
I think I know.

457
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,780
Do you have any kings?

458
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,420
No,go fish.

459
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,950
See,Barney,isn't it nice to just sit

460
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,060
and have a evening with a woman,no agenda?

461
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,490
Just make nice conversation?

462
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,430
No.

463
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,270
Yeah,kinda sucks, doesn't it?

464
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:25,610
Oh,my God,Barney, you really did just rock my world.

465
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,640
That was amazing.

466
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,480
And I'not lying.

467
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,610
I know you're not lying,baby.

468
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
And it was good for you?

469
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,080
It was the best sex I've ever had.

470
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,290
Later.

471
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,560
Daddy's back.

472
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,900
Hey,buddy, how's it going?

473
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,760
Hey. Pretty good.

474
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,570
Pretty good. Ooh!

475
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,600
I can move my legs now and can lift my arms this high.

476
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,470
Yeah,you know,I feel like I have more energy.

477
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,340
Ye,it was hard at first but now if I go a day

478
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,510
without working out,I miss it.

479
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,450
I'm proud of us,guys.

480
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,680
The first week is the hardest.

481
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,150
We're over the hump.

482
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,420
Joining that gym was the best decision we ever made.

483
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,020
And we never went back to the gym again.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
