1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,672
So, being married different
not different?

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,058
It's the same. Mostly.

3
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:07,370
Except I think I might be
getting carpal tunnel.

4
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:09,054
My hand keeps cramping up.

5
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,995
I thought the whole point of getting married
was that you didn't have to do that anymore.

6
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:15,421
No, it's from writing
all the thank you notes.

7
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:16,451
Mostly.

8
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:18,788
Yeah.
You're writing constantly.

9
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:21,964
There's forms we have to sign,
our death folders,

10
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:23,010
- thank you notes.
- Whoa, whoa.

11
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:24,812
What are death folders?

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,739
It's this thing they recommend you do
in case one spouse dies unexpectedly.

13
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:32,587
It's all the information your spouse might
need all in one convenient location.

14
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,053
Yeah. Account info,
important addresses,

15
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,481
a letter to the other person.
All that stuff.

16
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:40,871
- I'll get the next round.
- Thanks.

17
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:44,773
- I am such a jerk.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,413
Wait, why?

19
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,001
I didn't know that I was
supposed to write a letter.

20
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:51,761
All Lily's gonna find in that folder
are a bunch of bank statements

21
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:53,641
and a funny list of things to do
with my ashes.

22
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:55,263
- Marshall brownies.
- Number six.

23
00:00:56,168 --> 00:00:58,071
Oh, God, I am a bad husband.

24
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:01,272
No, uh, no, I'll just write,
I'll write Lily a letter tonight,

25
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:02,850
- everything'll be fine.
- That's right.

26
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:07,373
Unless... you die between
now and then.

27
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,111
- But... come on, that's never gonna happen.
- Yes.

28
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:12,612
If there's one thing we can state
with absolute certainty

29
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:16,511
it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going
to die before writing that letter.

30
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:18,083
No way at all.

31
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,090
In fact, I dare God
to smite down

32
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,423
- this perfectly healthy...
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

33
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,342
I get it. Okay, you guys know
I'm a little superstitious,

34
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:29,051
and you guys are trying
to freak me out.

35
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,591
Well, guess what?
It didn't work. So, there.

36
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:43,803
You guys are jerks!

37
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:48,691
How I Met Your Mother 3x02
<i>- We’re Not From Here -</i>

38
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:01,141
<i>So, after Robin and I broke up,
she needed some time away.</i>

39
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:03,871
<i>Away from her normal home,
her normal life,</i>

40
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:06,460
<i>and it turns out, her normal self.</i>

42
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,493
I was just so uptight
in New York, you know?

44
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:12,763
I mean down here everybody
shares everything.

46
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:18,600
It's like, we're all one big
shimmering ball of positive energy.

47
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:21,222
I wonder if anyone's ever
thought that before.

48
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,473
Here. Eat.

49
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:27,743
If we run out of fish,
I will catch more with my hands.

50
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:31,482
A drum circle!

51
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,501
They're different every time.
Let's go watch!

52
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:38,050
- Here I am at the drum circle.
- Whoa, are you topless?

53
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,133
- Ted, check this out.
- Seen 'em.

54
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:43,793
- Wow, it seems like a great trip.
- Oh, it was.

55
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,073
I feel like,

56
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:48,323
the Robin who left is not
the same Robin who came back, you know.

57
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:51,133
Wow, there's a lot
of nude people in here.

58
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:53,681
You haven't changed, Scherbatsky.

59
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:57,003
You're a sophisticated,
scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking,

60
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,172
red-meat-eating,
gun-toting New Yorker.

61
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:01,983
Just shoes and a shirt.
That's a look.

62
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,091
What you are not is
a massage-giving, windsurfing,

63
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:07,892
bongo-playing,
teetotaling, vegan, peacenik,

64
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:10,373
hippy like you soon to be
ex-boyfriend, Gael.

65
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,611
Back me up here, Ted.

66
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,363
I'm just happy Robin's happy.

67
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:14,542
Thank you.

68
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:18,262
Man, this is like a "Where's Waldo"
of exposed genitalia.

69
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,713
Except that it's really
easy to find Waldo.

70
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,380
I'm evolved...

71
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:24,791
and I'm enjoying living my life

72
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,862
a little bit closer to the way
Gael and I did in Argentina.

73
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:31,431
Please. Vacation romances have
an expiration date.

74
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,750
Gael's got a "best if banged by"
sticker on him.

75
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:37,010
Once your romance starts to stink,

76
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,951
you'll dump his ass
down the drain like sour milk

77
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:43,542
and go back to being "Unevolved Robin",
the one we actually like.

78
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:45,203
Back me up here, Ted.

79
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:46,652
I'm just happy Robin's happy.

80
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:50,973
- I'm telling you, within three days...
- Here he comes. Switched to big words.

81
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:53,801
Within a triad of solar periods,

82
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:57,543
you'll recognize your dearth
of compatibility with your paramour

83
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:59,180
and conclude your association.

84
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,801
My journey was transforvative.

85
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:04,010
And I reassert my commitment
to both the aforementioned paramour

86
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:06,300
and the philosophies he espouses.

87
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,553
What are we talking of?
Baseball?

88
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:12,872
This is all gonna return to
masticate you in the gluteals.

89
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,222
Support my hypothesis, Ted.

90
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:18,293
I'm just jubilant my former
paramour's jubilant.

91
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:25,490
<i>That night, Marshall sat down
to write the letter</i>

92
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:27,603
<i>he hoped Lily would never
have to read.</i>

93
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:31,622
<i>"My dearest, sweetest, Lily pad.</i>

94
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,523

00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:38,740

00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,880

<i>Deeper than a Scottish loch."</i>

00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:55,543
<i>"If I died under suspicious
circumstances,</i>

101
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,321
<i>"then beware.</i>

102
00:04:57,407 --> 00:05:00,800
<i>"Trust no one. Not even Ted."</i>

103
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:06,501
<i>"Especially not Ted."</i>

104
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,513
<i>"Know that I'll always
be there in your heart</i>

105
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,313
<i>"whenever you need me,</i>

106
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:14,151
<i>"and that my love for you

107
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:18,220
<i>"Love...

108
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,302
<i>"M, ATM pin code:</i>

109
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:44,350

<i>"Teacher's pension account:

111
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,583
<i>"Cancel Vogue, L."</i>

112
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:56,463
My windsurfing board...
it had floated away.

113
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,352
And the shark...

114
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,693
he was getting closer.

115
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:03,871
They say to escape
you punch a shark in the nose.

116
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:06,020
But I said, "Brother shark,

117
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:09,783
we are both children
from the same Earth mother."

118
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:13,093
And that's all I remember
until the hospital.

119
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,532
- That guy.
- Yeah. That guy.

120
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,021
Look at how easy
he has it.

121
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:23,952
You and me, we have to bend over
backwards to get a woman to, well,

122
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,370
bend over backwards.
But that guy...

123
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:32,610
Every woman in the bar is hanging on
his every slightly mispronounced word.

124
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:35,393
- And why?
- He's better looking than us.

125
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,592
No. Because he's from
out of town.

126
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:43,442
With and accent and an innocent smile,
you don't even have to try.

127
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,773
Plus automatic out,
you're leaving in a couple of days.

128
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:49,372
God, I wish we were tourists.

129
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,592
Actually...

130
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:54,943
You know where I've been
meaning to visit?

131
00:06:58,268 --> 00:06:59,841
We're from a small town
in the south of France.

132
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,751
Our plane leaves Sunday morning.

133
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:04,651
Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies.

134
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:06,921
Hate to bother you.
We seem to be a little bit lost.

135
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:09,792
Would you happen to know which
street the Statue of Liberty's on?

136
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:12,681
Actually,it's own Island.

137
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,632
- Oh!
- Oh, it's right...

138
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:16,441
- Ah.
- Thank you very...

139
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:20,150
Uh, my name is, uh,
Ignatius Peabody Nobel.

140
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,803
From East Westerton, Missouri.

141
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:25,851
And this is my friend... Ted.

142
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,783
- Hi, um, I'm Colleen.
- Hi, Colleen.

143
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,860
- This is Lindsay.
- Hi, Lindsay.

144
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:33,672
So, hey, you-you-you ladies, been awful
nice to us. What do you say...

145
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,649
- Ah, never mind.
- No, what is it?

146
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:39,087
Well... it's just we're leaving
Sunday morning.

147
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,210
It sure would be nice to have
some real New Yorkers show us around.

148
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:47,411
Well, we're busy tonight, but...
maybe tomorrow afternoon?

149
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:48,750
After lunch?

150
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,090
Well, hotdog!

151
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:54,431
Should we... you want just meet here
in front of Mac... MacLaren's Pub?

152
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,261
It's kind of a lame bar,
but sure.

153
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:58,083
Really? It doesn't seem
that lame to me.

154
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,900
- It's pretty lame.
- I think it's cool.

155
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,861
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

156
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:05,901
I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar
a lot of cool people would hang out at.

157
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,060
All right, come-on.

158
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,392
So, Gael, huh?
Still going strong?

159
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,433
Yeah, it's great.

160
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:15,160
- Amazing, fantastic, awesome.
- Oh, that's one too many.

161
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:16,331
What's going on?

162
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:17,902
Well, now that I'm home,

163
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:21,001
I'm finding myself getting annoyed
at things that I loved on vacation.

164
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:22,871
Here, taste.

165
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,503
Experience your food.

166
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,762
Oh. So good.

167
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:31,522
Here, taste.

168
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:33,701
Experience your food.

169
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:36,463
Ooh, sofa, ooh, sofa.
Sofa, sofa, oh.

170
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:40,640
We're alone now.

171
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:41,903
I must have you.

172
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,670
I must have you.

173
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,302
Laptop, laptop, laptop!

174
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,750
And you know what else?

175
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:55,821
I'm still finding sand everywhere.

176
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:59,290
I mean, we haven't been to the beach
since Argentina. Where is all coming from?

177
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:03,250
Well, maybe you're just going back
to the person you were before the trip.

178
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:04,710
But I don't want to.

179
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,710
I was so happy down there.

180
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:09,581
No, you know what?
I'm done complaining.

181
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,302
I'm evolving.

182
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:14,143
Just gonna...
go with the flow.

183
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:22,222
Gael, you're peeing
while I'm in the shower.

184
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:28,192
Okay. Okay, old Robin would have
been like, dude, ocupado.

185
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:31,850
But now, you know what,
I'm cool with it. Pee it up.

186
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,360
In fact, when you're done,
why don't you come in here and join me?

187
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,503
Don't mind if I do, love.

188
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,212
Gael, there's some weird du...

189
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:45,602
- Hello.
- Hey! Good news!

190
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,310
I made some
new traveling friends today,

191
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,502
and they'll be staying with us,
how do you say...

192
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:50,903
Indefinitely!

193
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,990
G'day!

194
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,780
Oh, here. Will you sign this
thank you note?

195
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,981
Wow. Both sides.

196
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:09,103
You wrote on both sides of
a thank you note to my third cousin

197
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:11,641
for a blender that you haven't
even taken out of the box.

198
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:15,193
- It's a really nice blender.
- Well if you love that blender so much,

199
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:16,280
why don't you just marry it.

200
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,210
I can't. I married you.
That's how we go the blender.

201
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:22,723
What's wrong?

202
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:26,181
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.
What could be wrong?

203
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:29,332
Except that when you die I'm gonna
find out that your parting words

204
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:32,242
to comfort me for all eternity
were "Cancel Vogue."

205
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,240
How can you open my letter?

206
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:37,111
That was not a letter.
It was barely even a text message.

207
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:40,410
Next time you write something that short,
at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.

208
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,031
Marshall, wait.

209
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:46,280
This was our first fight
as a married couple.

210
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:48,672
- Oh, baby.
- Oh...

211
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:53,591
<i>Kids, when you're visiting New York,</i>

212
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,231
<i>there's a count of fun things
to see and do.</i>

213
00:10:56,918 --> 00:11:00,011
<i>And yet, Colleen and Lindsay
took us to Tater-Skinz.</i>

214
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,032
This is our favorite restaurant
in the city.

215
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,992
Yes, I'm sure this is the best

216
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:08,082
of their 57 "spudtacular"
east coast locations.

217
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:11,950
- I'm going to run to the restroom.
- I'm gonna go, too.

218
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,472
This is just the easiest date ever.

219
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,380
You know what I'm gonna try next?
A knock, knock joke.

220
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,452
Easiest?

221
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:23,991
Somehow we have managed to find

222
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,722
the two lamest New Yorkers of all time.

223
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,490
- Ted, Ted, Ted.
- Dude, I am looking at you. What?

224
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:32,852
Right. Stay with me.
We are on the cusp

225
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:36,241
of moving from out-of-towners
to in-their-pantsers.

226
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:40,621
All right, Ignatius, one more hour.

227
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:43,563
Nice. Hey, nice.

228
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:47,170
Hey, our friends invited us to a party.
You guys want to come along?

229
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,762
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

230
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:49,561
Yes, we do.

231
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:54,701
Quick announcement.

232
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:58,453
I am so glad that you're here,
fellow travelers.

233
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,682
A couple rules...
not even rules.

234
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:05,772
Let's call them guidelines
for harmonious living.

235
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,533
Guideline for harmonious living
number one...

236
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:13,443
the kitchen sink is for dishes,
the toilet is for pee-pee.

237
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:15,990
G.F.H.L. Number two...

238
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:18,892
marijuana is illegal in
the United States,

239
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,110
even when baked
into a blueberry muffin

240
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:23,892
that someone might mistakenly
eat for breakfast

241
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,902
right before they leave for
their job as a TV newscaster.

242
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:32,553
"This just in: Look at my hand,
how weird is my hand?"

243
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,252
is not an appropriate thing
to say on the air.

244
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:37,470
And number three, I...

245
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:44,142
And number three is please keep
the noise to a minimum.

246
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:45,851
I have to take a nap.

247
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:48,063
I'm still pretty baked.

248
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,233
Everything's so bright,

249
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:55,950
even at night.

250
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:57,942
No wonder
the city never sleeps.

251
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:01,362
Hey, if we're going north,
why did we cross over the FDR?

252
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:02,993
We should have taken the Hudson.

253
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,731
Now he knows all the streets.

254
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:07,562
Someone's been watching
too many Steinfeld reruns.

255
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,132
- Where are we even going anyway?
- 148th and Brook Avenue.

256
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:15,641
A hundred... in the South Bronx
at this time of night?

257
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:16,530
We're going to get killed.

258
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:19,291
Ted, I think
these local New Yorkers

259
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:23,112
know more about the city
than we do, so relax.

260
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,081
We're in very capable hands.

261
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:29,541
There were three of them,
at least two guns...

262
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:30,590
They took all our money.

263
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,450
Well, I only had traveler's checks.

264
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,221
Hey, babe.

265
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,121
I've been thinking
about our fight.

266
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,211
Yes?

267
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,133
I'm really, really...

268
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,201
surprised that you haven't
apologized to me yet.

269
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:50,921
Wow, you really want
to open this up again.

270
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:54,070
Oh, I forgot,
you open everything up,

271
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:56,163
even if you're not supposed to
until I'm dead.

272
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,212
You know that this is important to me.
Why won't you just write the letter?

273
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,263
Because I can't bear the
thought of not being with you,

274
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:05,712
not even for long enough
to write you a stupid letter.

275
00:14:06,537 --> 00:14:07,352
Really?

276
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:08,831
Yes, really.

277
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,092
Plus, I know
as soon as I write it,

278
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,960
you're just going to open
it up and read it again.

279
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:15,003
Lily, I won't, I promise.

280
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,402
I'll write you a letter
for my death folder.

281
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:23,732
Do you mind, um, maybe slipping
in a little bit of dirty stuff, too?

282
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:26,871
I tell you what.

283
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,690
How about I make it
all dirty stuff and

284
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:31,892
slip in a little clean stuff?

285
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,750
You're the best.

286
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,483
And maybe a couple Polaroids?

287
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:41,151
Come on, let's get out of here.
This night's a disaster.

288
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:42,031
What?!

289
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:44,260
This night couldn't
have gone any better.

290
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,622
We just survived a mugging.
You know what that means.

291
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:51,280
- "Thank God we're alive" sex.
- "Thank God we're alive" sex.

292
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,812
It's even better than "I can't believe
you just proposed to me" sex,

293
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:55,671
which I've only had,
like, four or five times.

294
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:59,053
Ted, please, we are so close.

295
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:02,102
All right, I'm in. I've never worked
this hard for anything in my life.

296
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:08,571
Wow, I think we all need
to go back to our place and recover.

297
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:13,023
Yeah. I just want to celebrate
the fact that we survived. You know?

298
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:15,823
Me, too.

299
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:19,253
- So where do you live?
- What, West Village?

300
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,112
- Close.
- West Orange.

301
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:25,253
- West Orange, New Jersey?
- Yeah.

302
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:28,391
You guys live in New Jersey,
not New York?

303
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,451
- Theodore.
- Yep.

304
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,112
- New Jersey?
- Teddy.

305
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:33,031
Yeah, but don't worry,
it's pretty much New York.

306
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,200
- Oh. No. Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

307
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,771
New Jersey is not
"pretty much New York."

308
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,870
You are not
"pretty much New Yorkers."

309
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,813
- And how would you know?
- Because I live here.

310
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:47,620
That's right, I live here.
Yes, we're full of crap, yes.

311
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,152
We pretended to be from out of town

312
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:50,621
so we could sleep with you
and leave in the morning.

313
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,563
But you know what's even
worse than that?

314
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:55,302
Saying you're a New Yorker
when you're not.

315
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,910
Because this is the
greatest city in the world

316
00:15:56,937 --> 00:16:00,093
and you have to earn the right
to call yourself a New Yorker.

317
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:01,242
So why don't you girls

318
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:04,803
crawl into the open sewer pipe
you call the Holland Tunnel

319
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:08,363
and flush yourselv back
to "pretty much New York"?

320
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,992
Because I will do a lot
to get laid,

321
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:14,360
but I am not going
to New Jersey!

322
00:16:18,465 --> 00:16:21,253
You're not from Missouri?

323
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:27,022
Well, I will be a monkey's unc...

324
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:30,421
Can we get a ride?

325
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:35,673
Hey, um, sir, can we get
a ride, too?

326
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:38,080
Newark, born and raised.

327
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,030
Can you please keep it down?

328
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:55,841
What happened to you, man?

329
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:58,821
You said you wouldn't change,
but look at you.

330
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:02,921
No more tan,
no more aded braids,

331
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:07,392
no more lush, untamed forest
of leg and armpit hair.

332
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:10,760
You're back at work.
What gives?

333
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,663
Well, I have to have a job.

334
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:14,732
"I have to have a job."

335
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,092
God, that's so American.

336
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:19,072
I'm Canadian. You know that.

337
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:23,560
What about the important things
like making your own jewelry

338
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,112
and lying on the beach
and thinking about peace?

339
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:31,243
God, don't you care
about thinking about peace?

340
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:34,731
I just realized something.

341
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:36,491
That you've lost your way.

342
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,152
No,
that you really suck.

343
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,370
You're boring and lame
and you're getting sand everywhere.

344
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:44,412
Seriously, where is
all the sand coming from?

345
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:47,071
You're not the real me.

346
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:51,451
All you are is me on vacation
trying to get away from a break-up.

347
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:55,453
Don't you remember Argentina?

348
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,852
Don't you want to go back?

349
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,761
- What are you doing?
- Shh...

350
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:09,183
Let this happen.

351
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,592
All right, everyone out.

352
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:28,483
I said everyone out!

353
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:41,743
<i>All right, we're leaving,
we're leaving, okay.</i>

354
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,020
<i>Michael Moore was so right
about Americans.</i>

355
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,683
I'm Canadian!

356
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,300
Robin, you okay?

357
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:54,720
No, I'm not.

358
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:57,262
Listen, Gael,

359
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:58,453
I need to talk to you
about something.

360
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:01,340
<i>After they broke up,
Robin went back to being Robin.</i>

361
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,632
- Welcome home, Scherbatsky.
- Oh, good to be back.

362
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:07,052
Although it's weird.

363
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:10,332
Vacation Robin popped into
my dream again last night.

364
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:13,072
- Listening.
- This time we went all the way.

365
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,750
Tell you one thing.

366
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,803
She may be sandy, but that
chick knows what I like.

367
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:27,392
Okay, I'm done.

368
00:19:27,656 --> 00:19:30,862
But I really don't want you
reading this unless... you know,

369
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,631
something happens.

370
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,751
Can you swear to me
you won't open it?

371
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,502
Totally.
What does it say?

372
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,232
Marshall, I'm serious.

373
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:40,331
Okay.

374
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:44,512
I promise I won't, I won't
open that until you're dead.

375
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,571
<i>And through 22 wonderful years
of marriage, Marshall kept his promise</i>

376
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:52,062
<i>until November 1 of last year</i>

377
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,780
<i>when, sadly...</i>

378
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,441
<i>"Busted! I knew you'd read this.</i>

379
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:14,360
<i>You suck, Marshall,
you totally suck."</i>

380
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:17,982
That's it?

381
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:20,150
I suck?

382
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:22,733
- Lily.
- Yes, you suck.

383
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,882
You said you wouldn't read it
and you did.

384
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,470
Well, you didn't keep
your promise either.

385
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,140
I don't see any dirty
pictures in here.

386
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, fine,
I'll take the dirty pictures.

387
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:32,562
I don't want 'em now.

388
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,733
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What?!

389
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,602
Nothing.
Nothing.

390
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:41,222
You're beautiful. I would love the photos.
Have I told you how beautiful you look?
