1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,541
Kids, sometimes in life you see someone

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:05,082
and you just instantly know

3
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:06,823
this is the person for you.

4
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:08,864
It can happen anywhere.

5
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:11,147
Even the waiting room
of a tattoo removal clinic.

6
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:13,922
And that's what happened when I met...

7
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,905
...Stella.

8
00:00:20,462 --> 00:00:22,638
Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp.

9
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:24,146
My bread and butter.

10
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:25,988
So I'm guessing that the real story

11
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:27,730
involves a bad breakup and some booze.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,171
Unless it's a gang tattoo,

13
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,550
in which case, I think it's
time to find a new gang.

14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,957
No, I just thought it would be cool

15
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,330
to get a caterpillar tattoo,

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,039
and then a few weeks went by,
and all of a sudden...

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,848
(laughing)

18
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:40,194
Well, I can get rid of it
in ten one-hour sessions,

19
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:42,841
but, I should warn you,
laser surgery's very painful.

20
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,247
Well, I think you'll find

21
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:46,157
I have a very high
tolerance for pain.

22
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:48,536
Just last night, I sat through
the worst movie ever made.

23
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:49,942
Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?

24
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:54,163
No, the worst movie--
Manos: Hands of Fate.

25
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:55,705
Uh, I'm a doctor,
went to medical school.

26
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,380
It's Plan 9.
If you don't believe me,

27
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,922
it's playing down
at the Pamela Theater.

28
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:00,998
Uh-huh.
I don't believe you, Doctor.

29
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,578
Well, what are you
doing tonight?

30
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:08,336
Hello.

31
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,044
Hey, Ted.
Hey.

32
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:11,920
Hey, put that away.
Tonight's on me.

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,294
Oh, no, no, don't...

34
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:14,399
Come on, I insist.

35
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,108
That's so nice. Thank you.

36
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:17,716
Hey, guys,
this is my friend Ted.

37
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:18,889
He wants to pay.

38
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:20,966
Oh, wow. Oh, yay.
Wow, thank you.

39
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:23,412
One, two, three, four.

40
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:29,006
Is something wrong?

41
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,916
No, it's just, um...

42
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,558
I'm just a little embarrassed.

43
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:34,132
I thought this was a date.

44
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,975
But it's no big deal.

45
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:38,018
Don't worry about it.

46
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,593
What's wrong?

47
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:43,010
Ted's embarrassed-- he
thought this was a date.

48
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,423
Ted thought this was a date.

49
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,600
Stella, did you know Ted
thought this was a date?

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,476
What? I'm not allowed
to date a patient.

51
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,649
It's an AMA rule.

52
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:51,822
She's not allowed to date patients.

53
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:52,927
It's an AMA rule.

54
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:54,099
She's not allowed to date patients.

55
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:55,439
It's an AMA rule.

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,713
She's not allowed to date...

57
00:01:56,713 --> 00:01:58,622
Yeah, I got it.

58
00:01:58,622 --> 00:01:59,963
MAN: We all got it.

59
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:01,738
Ted's a schmuck.

60
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,648
(laughter)

61
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,987
(laughing)

62
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,130
And you bought all the tickets.
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,208
Hey, you were right.

64
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,391
Worst movie-going
experience ever.

65
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,636
Of course, it had nothing
to do with the movie.

66
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:29,913
I am so sorry that you
thought that was a date.

67
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,220
No, it's fine.

68
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,565
I got to hang out with you
on girls' night out.

69
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:35,777
All right, so if you're not
allowed to date a patient,

70
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:38,524
I'll just... I'll wait until
these ten session are up

71
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:39,998
and then I'll ask you out then.

72
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:42,041
Well, then,fair warning:

73
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,717
I'm going to say no.

74
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,894
Really? I'm getting mixed
signals from you.

75
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:49,010
I feel like you've been staring
at my ass for quite some time.

76
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,924
What, you're married?
No.

77
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:52,929
Boyfriend?
No.

78
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:54,169
Lesbian?
No.

79
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,079
Only date black guys?
No.

80
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,228
And yet you can say
with absolute confidence

81
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:02,210
that ten weeks from now,
if I ask you out on a date,

82
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,282
your answer will be...

83
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:04,035
No.

84
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:06,967
No... Hmm.

85
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,642
What could she mean

86
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:11,356
when she says no?

87
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:12,729
I don't know,

88
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,003
it is totally cryptic.

89
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,113
This is far from over.

90
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,687
We're talking ten weeks from now.

91
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,531
Who knows what she'll want then?

92
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:20,703
Do you know what you're going to want

93
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:21,976
for lunch ten weeks from now?

94
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:24,086
Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail
and a milk shake.

95
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:26,935
Ted, do you know how long
it takes a woman

96
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,878
to decide whether or not
she's going to sleep with a guy?

97
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:30,218
8.3 seconds.

98
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:31,223
After that,

99
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,261
her decision is made.

100
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:33,500
She will not change her mind.

101
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,506
That's ridiculous.

102
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,846
Is it?

103
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:38,157
Describe your first
8.3 seconds with Stella.

104
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:40,838
Lower back butterfly tattoo--

105
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,814
you're up.

106
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:45,561
(patients snickering)

107
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,869
(all groaning)

108
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:48,577
So we got off to a rocky start.

109
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,688
That may be a problem for some guys,

110
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,363
but I get better over time.
Right?

111
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,373
I'm not some Top 40 song--

112
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:55,713
easily digestible.

113
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,153
I'm complex.

114
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,336
I require time and multiple listens.

115
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,078
I'm "Stairway to Heaven."

116
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:06,133
Wow, Roger Daltrey just
rolled over in his grave.

117
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:10,253
That's not the right guy, is it?

118
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,340
He's not even dead, is he?

119
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,815
I think that's great, Ted.

120
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,657
You can do whatever you set your mind to.

121
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,500
In fact, you've inspired me.

122
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,979
I'm going to stop biting my nails.

123
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,855
But, baby, you love
biting your nails.

124
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:25,765
I know, but I'm doing this for Ted.

125
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:27,909
Hmm.

126
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:30,287
God, this is really hard.

127
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,901
Give me ten sessions,

128
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,341
I'm going to turn that "no"
into a "yes."

129
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,480
Really, Ted?
Mm-hmm.

130
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,821
You think so?
Mmm.

131
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:39,266
Well, tell me, how did
the rest of that session go?

132
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,544
This is going to hurt a little.

133
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:43,521
Yeah, well, I can handle pain.

134
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:46,201
This one time
I was playing tennis, and...

135
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:48,278
(high-pitched screaming)

136
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,538
Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts.

137
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,917
Everyone probably sounds like that.

138
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,324
Doctor, are you all right?

139
00:04:57,324 --> 00:04:58,932
I heard a woman
screaming in here.

140
00:04:58,932 --> 00:04:59,685
Oh.

141
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,230
(laughing)

142
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:10,423
Here's to nine more great sessions.

143
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,902
(laughter continues)

144
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:16,320
weeks went by.

145
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,832
The second session I told her
about how I spent a summer

146
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,675
working with inner-city kids.

147
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:24,059
The third session we both spoke
nothing but French.

148
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:27,040
The fourth session
I made her laugh so hard

149
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,883
she fell out of her chair.

150
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,659
(laughing)

151
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,373
So by the time the fifth
session came around...

152
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:34,444
Still no.

153
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,191
Still no.

154
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,464
What's up with that?

155
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,006
I mean, I juggled.

156
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,446
You juggled?

157
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,858
I thought you were
trying to impress her.

158
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,199
You do magic.

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,941
How is juggling
any lamer than magic?

160
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,449
Magic's not lame.

161
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,889
I don't get it.
I mean...

162
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,296
Is this lame?

163
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,741
(screams)
Oh, Barney, no, no.

164
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:56,254
We said no fireballs at the table.

165
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,829
What the hell is wrong with you?

166
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,202
There's alcohol in here.

167
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,242
Barney...
I...

168
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:01,413
We've talked about this.

169
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,553
It's a fire code violation.

170
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,731
Yeah, but Ted provoked me.

171
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,037
No, no, you are on a time-out.

172
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,042
Go sit over there.

173
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,717
But...
Go!

174
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:13,207
Anyway... I don't get it.

175
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,882
She should be into me by now.

176
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,523
You know, you can do this, Ted.

177
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,299
I said that I would
stop biting my nails,

178
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,175
and kablam-ey.

179
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:21,850
It's just a challenge.

180
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,559
It can't be easy to woo someone

181
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,971
while you're sticking your
naked butt in their face.

182
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,713
Works for baboons.

183
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,169
It's called "presenting."

184
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:33,777
I got four sessions left.

185
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:36,021
Ther-There's got to be
an angle I'm not seeing.

186
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,266
You can't turn a "no"
into a "yes," Ted.

187
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,272
Can't be done.

188
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,444
I don't know, Barney.

189
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:42,320
I mean, sometimes
persistence pays off.

190
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,325
I said "yes" eventually.

191
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:44,899
No, you didn't.

192
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,340
You were like, "No, we
can't, we're friends.

193
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,217
It would mess up the
dynamic of the group."

194
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,724
To Ted.

195
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:50,964
Oh, right.

196
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,170
Wait a second.

197
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,811
Wait a second,
I got the angle.

198
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,553
Sir, please don't yell at me,

199
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:57,027
because when people yell at me,

200
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,904
I have a tendency to start crying.

201
00:06:58,904 --> 00:07:00,980
Please don't do it.

202
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,556
Abby, I've told you before.
Please.

203
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,431
When they're rude to you,
hang up the phone.

204
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,208
...how difficult it
is for me to... Go on,

205
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,682
you can do this, hang up.

206
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:08,955
Abby,

207
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:10,228
hang it up.

208
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:13,477
I am too busy
to waste my time...

209
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,492
I'm sorry, I just wish

210
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,905
that some of the patients
would be nicer to you.

211
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,512
The receptionist.

212
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:21,518
That's my way in.

213
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:22,590
I like this.

214
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,265
Seduce the receptionist.

215
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:25,705
That's a great plan.

216
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:27,046
That's not the plan.

217
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,721
And how would that help me
with Stella?

218
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:30,229
Who?

219
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:32,239
Here's the plan.

220
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,618
(whistles)

221
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:36,661
Hi. Here.

222
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:37,799
I stopped--

223
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:43,428
Hi, I stopped for coffee

224
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:45,305
and I... and I thought
I'd grab you something.

225
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:47,449
Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice.

226
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,454
You're like a knight.

227
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:51,067
I should call you Sir Ted.

228
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,173
What?

229
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,579
Nothing. Nothing.

230
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:55,858
(laughing nervously):
It's really stupid.

231
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,800
Um, Dr. Zinman, Ted's here.

232
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,811
Thanks. Thanks, Abby.

233
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,836
And now we wait.

234
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,377
And sure enough,

235
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:08,890
by session seven, she saw me
in a whole new light.

236
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,771
Okay, I'm about
to break my big rule here.

237
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:13,011
Break it.

238
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,088
Okay.

239
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:16,730
Abby goes bowling

240
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,673
with her church group
every Wednesday night...

241
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:21,353
Mm-hmm. ...and she really wanted
to invite you, but she's too shy.

242
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:23,531
(clicks tongue)

243
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:24,736
Abby is...?

244
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:27,719
My receptionist.

245
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,461
You really made
quite an impression on her

246
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:30,935
with the coffee the other day.

247
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,877
I mean, she has really
not stopped talking about you.

248
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:35,256
Oh, Abby.

249
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:37,468
I thought you said "Alan."

250
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:40,416
But you just said, "Abby is...?"

251
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,957
Right.

252
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:44,302
Right, I thought I said "Alan."

253
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,776
Who's Alan?

254
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,456
Who's Abby?

255
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:50,567
My receptionist.

256
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,531
Exactly.

257
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,535
What is happening?

258
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,009
(groaning):
Ted.

259
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,287
You just got to be
yourself, no more gimmicks.

260
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,465
You're right, no more gimmicks.

261
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:04,705
One more gimmick.

262
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:06,280
TED:
You know what's on her shelf?

263
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,759
That self-help book
The Power of Me.

264
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,769
(all groaning)
I know, I know, but I thought

265
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,650
if I read it, maybe we'd have
something new to talk about.

266
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,426
(all groaning)

267
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:16,699
It's actually a great book.

268
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:19,044
It taught me the power
of complete memory.

269
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:20,384
Can I borrow your copy?

270
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:22,528
I left it somewhere.

271
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,935
I forget.

272
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:26,130
Hi.

273
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,429
Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

274
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:33,651
Hi, Ted.
I'll let her know.

275
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,437
Telepathically?

276
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:39,045
(laughing):
That's funny.

277
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,284
That's funny, smart, and great.

278
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,640
I am so sorry that I am late.

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,282
I have, like, two minutes
for lunch everyday.

280
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:47,756
It's crazy. Yeah, I understand.

281
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,570
I was just, uh, checking
out the old bookshelf here.

282
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,480
I see you've read The Power of Me.

283
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,824
It's funny...What? Oh, no.

284
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,839
No, no, no, no, no, I would
never read that piece of crap.

285
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,884
Some patient left it here.

286
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,055
Oh, thank God.

287
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:02,228
(chuckling):
I couldn't agree more.

288
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,602
That's total crap.

289
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,311
I see people reading that
on the subway

290
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:07,522
and I just want to shout,
"Get a life, people!"

291
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,264
Ted, I found your book.

292
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:10,336
What?

293
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:11,676
Your book The Power of Me.

294
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,116
I think you accidentally
dropped it in the garbage.

295
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:14,289
What? No, that's...
that's not mine.

296
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,529
I've never seen that before
in my life.

297
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,539
No, you were reading it
in the lobby.

298
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:19,314
Wha-- no, you have me confused
with someone else.

299
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,487
No, no, look right here.

300
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,732
"From the personal library
of Ted Mosby."

301
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,507
That's you.

302
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:29,164
Ted, I hate to say this,

303
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:32,213
but I think it's "nail
the receptionist" time.

304
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:33,788
I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.

305
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:35,798
Ted, every little boy
wants to grow up

306
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:37,473
to nail the doctor or the lawyer.

307
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:40,153
Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.

308
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,996
No. I like Stella.

309
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:43,638
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Ted.

310
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:46,552
Your little Stella is not so perfect.

311
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:47,490
What do you mean?

312
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,997
I went down there

313
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,208
and checked her out for myself.

314
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,448
Yeah.

315
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:54,894
And while I was down there,

316
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,340
I discovered that she had a secret,

317
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,326
a terrible... terrible secret.

318
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,532
What?

319
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:03,739
What is it?

320
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,725
Hold on, I gotta pee.

321
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,756
Okay, I'm back.

322
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,598
What's going on at work?

323
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,039
What's the big secret?!

324
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,379
Oh. Oh, right.

325
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,289
Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.

326
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,428
Sure, what's it regarding?

327
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:22,936
Oh, I just want to see her.

328
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:24,879
Want to look at her,
see what she looks like.

329
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,922
I-I don't understand.

330
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:28,463
I'm sorry, did I accidentally

331
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:30,340
oprima numero dos when I called?

332
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,250
Do you speak English?

333
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,426
I want to see her!

334
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,169
Sir, please don't yell at me

335
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,643
because when people yell at me,

336
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:39,285
I have a tendency to start crying.

337
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,290
What are your credentials?!

338
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,496
Please don't do that. Please.

339
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:43,338
I want to know who am I speaking with!

340
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:45,750
BARNEY: At first she seemed
great, beautiful, smart,

341
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,560
way out of your league.

342
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,235
But then, I overheard this conversation.

343
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,742
...my grandfather's name--
I was the last-born so...

344
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,753
Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?

345
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,925
No.

346
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,266
(sighs)

347
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,946
When am I going to kick
this folliculaphilia?

348
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:06,087
Folliculaphilia?

349
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,332
Folliculaphilia.

350
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,806
What is that?

351
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:12,285
Ted, your perfect woman

352
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:16,037
can only be attracted
to men with moustaches.

353
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,330
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

354
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,871
That's not real.

355
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,351
You're right, Ted.
I'm just making that up.

356
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:27,762
I know that you are
because there's no such thing.

357
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:31,347
I got it a little bit.

358
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,455
Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

359
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:41,532
Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache.

360
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,509
You look like a young Tom Selleck,

361
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,151
only a million times handsomer.

362
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:50,477
Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you.

363
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,818
Just kidding.

364
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,894
Stupid.

365
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:56,776
Sorry I'm late.
Typical two-minute lunch.

366
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,456
So we are very close to getting...

367
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:02,438
(laughing)

368
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:05,386
(cackling)

369
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:08,100
Why? Just why?

370
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,813
Y-you don't remember?

371
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:12,722
I'll bet anyone ten bucks

372
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:15,504
I can get Ted to grow a moustache.

373
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,050
Uh... okay.

374
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,467
You sabotaged my next to last
chance with Stella

375
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,041
for ten dollars?

376
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,592
I know. I would've done it for free.

377
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,603
But, no. You owe me ten bucks.

378
00:13:28,603 --> 00:13:32,824
This is awful.
My-my tenth session is next week.

379
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:34,968
I'm gonna ask her out,
and she's gonna say

380
00:13:34,968 --> 00:13:38,520
the most demoralizing syllable
in the English language-- no.

381
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:40,496
You know what?
Just forget it.

382
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:41,703
I'm not even gonna ask her.

383
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:43,545
No, you have to. She likes you.

384
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:45,019
She said so herself.

385
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:46,460
(clearing throat)
I mean...

386
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,536
Oh, my God,
you went and saw her, too.

387
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,748
I swear to you, I did not.

388
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,990
My wife's always getting
on me about my dry elbows.

389
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,698
So good to be in
a relationship.

390
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,038
Anyone special
in your life?

391
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:03,915
Or maybe just someone
you're interested in?

392
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,795
Interes-ted in?

393
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,151
You know, we should really
get this mole checked out.

394
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,457
It's just a little irregular.

395
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,975
MARSHALL:
Irregular? Oh, my God.

396
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,550
This is it. It's all over.

397
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,091
One of my patients has this

398
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,799
little butterfly tattoo
at the bottom of his back.

399
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,681
Can you stop talking about
your other patients?!

400
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,858
I'm dying here, woman!

401
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:28,102
There you go. Look, even if it is something,

402
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:30,381
it's easily treatable, so try to relax.

403
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:31,822
Okay.

404
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:33,396
Hey, what was it you were saying before

405
00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:35,038
about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?

406
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,551
Oh, that... that's nothing.

407
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,025
It's just a little crush.

408
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:42,241
So I will be calling
you with your results.

409
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:43,514
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

410
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,669
Oh, sir, your book!

411
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:50,148
No.

412
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:51,085
Yes.

413
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,967
She said "crush"?

414
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,547
And she was talking about me?

415
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:59,260
NARRATOR:
That last session was the least painful of all.

416
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,477
I savored every searing blast
of that laser.

417
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:04,051
All done.

418
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:07,334
The moment I'd waited
ten weeks for had arrived.

419
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,043
Stella...

420
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:13,867
...now that I'm
no longer your patient,

421
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,944
would you like
to have dinner with me?

422
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,405
Ted, you're a really nice guy...

423
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:23,248
Oh, no.

424
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,827
It has been so great
getting to know you.

425
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,436
I am gonna kill Marshall.

426
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:29,110
I've had so much fun
these last ten weeks.

427
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,958
Oh, my God, this is worse
than the laser.

428
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,835
I have a daughter.

429
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:36,314
What?

430
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,023
Her name's Lucy.
She's eight.

431
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:42,009
Work and being with her,
that's pretty much my life.

432
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,617
My social calendar

433
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,091
is movie night with the girls
once a month

434
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,532
when I can get a sitter.

435
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:48,978
I mean, I've been to one party
in the past year--

436
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:51,189
St. Paddy's Day--
it was awful, I left early.

437
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,400
But, really, my only free time

438
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,578
is the two minutes
I get for lunch, so...

439
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:56,884
this is why I don't date.

440
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,766
Ted, I only have time

441
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,513
for one most important person
in my life, and that's Lucy.

442
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:05,393
Anyway, it's been fun.

443
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:08,140
Next time, think before you ink.

444
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,553
But if you ever do wake up with, like,

445
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:15,110
a dolphin tattoo on your ankle,
just give me a call.

446
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,073
There it is--

447
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:22,379
she's a mom.

448
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,657
It's just not gonna happen.

449
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:26,634
Sorry, dude.

450
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,108
Have a shrimp.

451
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,449
I'm good.

452
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,229
I guess I got no one but myself to blame.

453
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:33,569
She told me right from the start

454
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:36,986
she was gonna say no and sure enough...

455
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:39,064
Wait a minute.

456
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,328
Hi.
Hi.

457
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:46,903
You didn't actually say no.

458
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:48,679
What do you mean?

459
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,455
All this time you were, uh,
you were supposed to say no,

460
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:52,632
but you didn't--
I checked the transcript.

461
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:53,972
(laughs)

462
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,546
So, here's what I'm proposing.

463
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,222
Uh... You only have two minutes, right?

464
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,093
Right.

465
00:16:58,093 --> 00:16:59,935
Okay. You want to, uh...

466
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,711
go on a a two-minute date with me?

467
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,932
Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter.

468
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:08,880
Um... Okay.

469
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,603
Great.

470
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,542
And... go.

471
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,620
Taxi!

472
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:19,299
Hello!

473
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,505
Ted, I seriously only have two minutes...

474
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:21,578
I know.

475
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,196
That's like 120 seconds.

476
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,871
380 West 22nd, please.

477
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,546
And step on it.
We're in a hurry.

478
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:30,289
380 West 22nd? That's...

479
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:34,107
Ha-ha!

480
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:35,213
Right this way.

481
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:36,922
(laughing):
Thank you, sir.

482
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,468
You know, I have always
wanted to try this place.

483
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:41,143
House salad.
Oh.

484
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,617
So, college?

485
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:43,824
Stanford.

486
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:44,929
Uh-huh. Wesleyan.

487
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,604
Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar?

488
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:48,647
No. Scott Crable?
Mm-mm.

489
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,657
Eggplant parmesean.

490
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,400
Thanks.
Oh, already cut up. Nice.

491
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,840
Could we get
the check please.

492
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,214
We're trying to make a movie
in 15 seconds.

493
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:56,755
Of course.  Okay, great.

494
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:58,196
Uh, how do you want
to do this?

495
00:17:58,196 --> 00:17:59,301
You had the eggplant parm.

496
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:00,843
I only really
had water so...

497
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:02,853
I'm kidding.  Oh.

498
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:04,260
Okay. Let's go.

499
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,370
Taxi! You nervous?

500
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,845
A little bit. You can't tell at all.

501
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:09,017
Oh, good. Yeah.

502
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:10,424
Hello!

503
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,001
384 West 22nd.

504
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,748
15 seconds. The movie's started.

505
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:23,356
Nah, previews. We'll be fine.

506
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,516
Ah! Just in time.
It hasn't started yet.

507
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,789
So, what are we seeing?

508
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:30,995
Manos: Hands of Fate.

509
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:32,000
The whole thing?

510
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,541
Only the important parts.

511
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:42,184
Worst movie ever.

512
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:44,865
Yeah, I almost walked  out, like, five times.

513
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:46,740
How we doing on time? Taxi!

514
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,880
We got a little time.

515
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,354
Okay. Do you want to walk it?

516
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:50,359
Why not?

517
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,565
Hello!

518
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:54,144
Good-bye!

519
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:55,384
So what grade's your daughter in?

520
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,390
Third grade.

521
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,595
Ah! That's a good year.

522
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,606
Yeah, she's wonderful.

523
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,548
I just wish that I could get her to quit
smoking, you know?

524
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:03,090
What?  I'm kidding.

525
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,273
Oh. Look,
coffee and dessert?

526
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:08,417
You know, this neighborhood
just keeps on changing.

527
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,092
This used to be a cute,
little Italian restaurant.

528
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:11,432
I know. New York.

529
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:13,543
It's a living organism,
an ever-changing tapestry.

530
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,285
Ooh, look at the time.

531
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:16,491
Let's go.

532
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:17,864
Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.

533
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,210
Flowers?

534
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,516
I'm allergic.

535
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:24,665
Okay. See?
We're getting to knock other.

536
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,211
Stella, I had a lovely--

537
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,188
Doggy bag?

538
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:31,366
Stella, I had a lovely time.

539
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:32,740
Me, too, Ted.

540
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,449
And... date.

541
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:36,023
(chuckles)
Huh?

542
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:37,362
That wasn't so bad, right?

543
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,909
No lengthy, awkward silences.

544
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,484
Dessert ran a little long, so...

545
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,728
I had to cut the good-night kiss.

546
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:47,681
I think I can be late just once.

547
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:00,010
Ted...

548
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,925
Look, I I uld love
to have a second date, I would.

549
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,772
But I understand that you really
don't have time right now,

550
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,386
but if you ever do,
will you give me a call?

551
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:09,726
Yes.

552
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:10,765
Okay.

553
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:15,958
And that, kids, is how you turn a "no"

554
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,331
into a "yes."

555
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,864
All my friends told me,
"Abby, be strong.

556
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:25,071
He doesn't deserve
another chance."

557
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,276
No, no, no.
But I forgive you!

558
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,354
No, no, no, no!

559
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,814
then he just kept

560
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:35,422
toying with my emotions.

561
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,064
Wow.

562
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:39,275
This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk.

563
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:41,352
You know your problem?

564
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:42,860
You're too sweet.

565
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,037
Aren't you going to see
the doctor about that mole?

566
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,344
Oh, yeah.

567
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,919
Turns out it's just
a Raisinet.

568
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:51,168
Hey, how would you like

569
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,547
me to take you out to a fancy restaurant

570
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,792
and then go on a shopping spree?

571
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:58,137
Treat you the way
you should be treated.

572
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,549
Would that make you forget
about that Ted monster?

573
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,358
My mom was wrong.

574
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,168
There are nice guys in New York.

575
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,384
We just have to go
by my hotel room first.

576
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:08,925
My bed was broken.

577
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,399
I just have to make sure
they fixed it.

578
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,074
Well, then if it's fixed,

579
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:14,385
can we can have sex on it
and then go shopping.

580
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:18,272
I like you.
