1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:02,714
<i>Now kids, when aunt Robin
was a teenager,</i>

2
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:03,904
<i>she was, well,</i>

3
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:05,739
<i>a Canadian pop star.</i>

4
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:09,826
<i>But by 2008, she was
an entirely different person...</i>

5
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:18,071
Coming up next:
Is your baby trying to kill you?

6
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,588
<i>...which made the events of that week
all the more surprising.</i>

7
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:24,356
So, I go in this morning and,
brr, it's freezing!

8
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:26,922
So I walk over there, and
I don't know why I'm still talking,

9
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:29,419
because clearly, we're all
asking the same question,

10
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,950
What in God's creation
is going on with Robin's breasts?

11
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:34,732
I know! Right?
Isn't it amazing?

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,029
I spent half an hour
making this happen.

13
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,697
There's tape in there,
cotton balls,

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,521
half of a Nerf football,
but it works, right?

15
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:42,481
Totally.
What's the occasion?

16
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,770
And old friend from Canada is in town
and I'm meeting him for a drink.

17
00:00:46,508 --> 00:00:48,242
Somebody you went
to Degrassi with?

18
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:51,662
No. Actually,
he was my first boyfriend.

19
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:56,451
<i>Simon. I thought he was
the coolest guy ever.</i>

20
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:59,991
<i>He smelled like Drakkar.
He could ollie on a skateboard.</i>

21
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:05,060
<i>And he had the most amazing collection
of Hard Rock Café T-shirts.</i>

22
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:08,090
<i>We spent the whole summer
madly in love.</i>

23
00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:10,821
Tell me more.
Tell me more.

24
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,592
Like, did he have a car?

25
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:15,853
So he's the guy who...

26
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:18,320
How shall I say this
like a gentleman?

27
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,641
Robin, did he take
your maple leaf?

28
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,401
No, it wasn't like that.

29
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:26,981
Sounds to me like he gave you
your first "O, Canada!" face.

30
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:30,173
<i>This went on
for a really long time.</i>

31
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:32,491
<i>Some of them jokes
were elegant and well-crafted...</i>

32
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:36,912
Wait, wait. Did he break up with you
and tell you he's just not that Inuit?

33
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:40,863
<i>...others were crude,
and ill-formed...</i>

34
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:43,602
Um, something about fur trapping.

35
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,981
<i>...and others were obvious,
but needed to be said...</i>

36
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,132
Did you ride his Zamboni?

37
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:53,750
Wait, wait, wait.
Did he...?

38
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:56,551
I think I'm out.

39
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:59,432
Yeah, I'm also "oot."

40
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:02,271
Okay, now I'm really out.

41
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:04,692
Well, I'm sorry, guys.
It was all very tame.

42
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:06,400
We only dated for
a week and a half.

43
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:09,110
I thought you said
you were together all summer.

44
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:12,422
Yeah. Summer in Canada is
pretty much the last week of July.

45
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:15,390
Anyway, one night, his band
just finish playing this gig...

46
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:22,120
Oh, my God! Simon.

47
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:25,382
That was such a good show.

48
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:28,112
You guys totally rocked out.

49
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,212
Yeah. I know.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,762
I figure we're about four or five gigs
away from really exploding.

51
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,543
We're gonna be big, babe.

52
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,393
I mean,
like Crash-Test-Dummies big.

53
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,722
- So, that everything?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:46,771
Listen, babe...

55
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,440
It's over.

56
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,111
What?

57
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,532
I'm getting back together
with Louise Marsh.

58
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,562
Louise Marsh?!

59
00:02:57,668 --> 00:03:00,042
That's a whore's name
if I ever heard one.

60
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:03,122
Yeah, why would he want to get back
together with Louise Marsh?

61
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,580
Well, the thing is...

62
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:08,922
her folks just put in a pool.

63
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,172
Totally... I get it.

64
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:16,301
Pools are great.
Swimming's awesome.

65
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,510
We have a sprinkler.

66
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,302
Run right through it.

67
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,682
Well, I should go.

68
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:28,982
Babe, wait.

69
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:31,653
Yeah, Simon?

70
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:34,151
You forgot to load
the drum set.

71
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,282
Tell me you did not
load the drum set.

72
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:40,662
I did.

73
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,510
And now he's coming here?
Robin,

74
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,081
why do you want
to see this guy?

75
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,420
Oh! I know why.

76
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:49,922
You're gonna win,
aren't you?

77
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,802
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

78
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,092
Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't
seen someone for a long time,

79
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:56,790
no matter how much you want
to deny it, there's always

80
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,632
a clear winner
and a clear loser.

81
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:00,351
Well, since you brought it up,

82
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:01,473
let's add up the points.

83
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:03,680
You're starting out
with two big ones right there.

84
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:05,783
Thank you. Okay.

85
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,861
So, Simon still lives
with his mom.

86
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,091
Point Robin.

87
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:10,550
He never became
a rock star.

88
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:11,481
Point Robin.

89
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,233
He now works at a water slide
park outside of Ottawa.

90
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:15,752
- Point Simon.
- Wait.

91
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:18,283
- Do they have a wave pool?
- No.

92
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,631
Ah. Point Robin.

93
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,912
That's five-zip.
There's no coming back from that.

94
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:25,623
Yeah, he's going down. I mean,
unless somehow, he got hotter.

95
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:28,503
There he is.

96
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:31,662
<i>And sure enough,
there was a clear winner,</i>

97
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,710
<i>and a clear loser.</i>

98
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,220
<i>It just wasn't clear
to everybody.</i>

99
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:40,802
Hey, babe.

100
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,630
Oh, my God.

101
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:48,661
How I Met Your Mother 3x16
<i>- Sandcastles In The Sand -</i>

102
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,570
Okay, what the hell
just happened?

103
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:03,200
Oh, come on,
it wasn't so bad, was it?

104
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:08,031
- Hey, Simon.
- Wow, look at you.

105
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,121
You got old.

106
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:14,491
Yeah. You look great.

107
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:16,751
You got hotter,
like that's possible.

108
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:22,830
Look, I know it didn't go
as planned, but,

109
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,141
I can't help it.

110
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:25,603
I mean...

112
00:05:25,807 --> 00:05:26,641
he's still got it.

114
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,020
Whoa! Four bucks for a brew?

116
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:33,403
What a rip.
Good think I'm packing.

117
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:38,441
So he's not a snob.

118
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:41,232
He's from a different part
of Canada, you know?

119
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:44,373
The maple leaf flag
on the back of the pickup truck?

120
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:47,280
He's Red Province.
He's from the Deep North.

121
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:50,451
The thing is, we gave you
so many opportunities.

122
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:54,580
So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local
celebrity here in New York.

123
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:57,821
She's the lead anchor
at Metro News One.

124
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,171
- Tell him, Robin.
- No. It's stupid.

125
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,883
It's not cool,
like Simon's shirt.

126
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:07,843
I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are
nattering on about our big celebrity.

127
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,100
What do you do for a living?

128
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,773
Oh, I work at the Splish Splash
Ottawa Water Slide Park.

129
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:16,271
A water slide park. That sure is
different than what Robin does.

130
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,022
Yeah, it is...
because I save lives.

131
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:23,470
If I'm not sitting in that stool
at the top of the slide, going...

132
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:24,952
Go...

133
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:26,690
Go...

134
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,351
Go...

135
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,702
people die.

136
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,632
What, you think
it's so easy?

137
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:33,753
You try it.

138
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:38,062
- Go.
- You didn't put your hand up

139
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:38,923
kid just died.

140
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,933
- No, I didn't know...
- Another kid just went,

141
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:41,761
he died too.

142
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,150
Oh, well, sure.
I mean, if I was actually...

143
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:44,610
Another kid just went,

144
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:46,962
now you've got a pile-up and Robin's
got something to report on the news.

145
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,789
This just in: My friend, Ted,
just killed a bunch of kids today.

146
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:54,017
Well, that's cool.
You got to pay the bills somehow

147
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,940
since your whole music thing
didn't really pan out, did it?

148
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:58,961
Well, it hasn't panned out yet,
but the band's still going.

149
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:02,113
About four or five gigs away
from really exploding.

150
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,592
The Foreskins are still playing?

151
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:07,130
The Foreskins?

152
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,412
How'd you guys come up
with that name?

153
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:14,293
Well, there's four of us,
and we play without shirts.

154
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,372
Babe, seriously.

155
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:19,900
I know. I'm sorry.

156
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,422
I know. I'm sorry.

157
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:26,312
But you guys just don't understand.

158
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:28,243
The fact that he kept
the band going...

159
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,293
that's impressive.

160
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:31,350
I mean, I gave up
my musical dream.

161
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:35,692
Which brings us to the most important
piece of information from tonight.

162
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:39,653
So, Simon,
how did you guys meet?

163
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,383
Oh, I was in her video.

164
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:44,240
Starred in it is more like it.

165
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,351
Once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg,

166
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:48,690
everybody wants a piece
of the moneymaker.

167
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,890
I'm sorry. I've seen "Let's Go to
the Mall" about a thousand times,

168
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:55,330
- and you, sir, are not in it.
- No, I was in the other one.

169
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,722
There's another video?!

170
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,090
Robin, seriously,

171
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:07,303
just make this easier on yourself
and give us the tape.

172
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,513
All right.

173
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:13,262
You give me no choice.

174
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:14,953
From this moment on,

175
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:20,472
I will spend every waking minute
searching down this tape.

176
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,860
I will not sleep.
I will not eat.

177
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:28,031
My life will be a living hell of search
engines and overseas phone calls,

178
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:31,623
chasing down something
that possibly can't be found.

179
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:33,680
Okay.

180
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:39,792
It's just... It was so hard to watch,
Robin. You're usually so cool.

181
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,010
I don't know what's wrong with me.

182
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:45,463
I'm sitting next to Simon,
and suddenly I'm 16 again.

183
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:48,631
Oh, it's actually a common thing. When
you're around someone from your past,

184
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,970
you kind of revert back to
who you were when you knew them.

185
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:53,001
There's not really
a name for it, though.

186
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:54,082
It's called "revertigo."

187
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,970
Yeah, I don't know
about "revertigo."

188
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,273
You know who gets
really bad revertigo?

189
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:03,522
Lily when she around
her high school friend, Michelle.

190
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,902
Michelle? She sounds hot.

191
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,320
You don't know
about Lily and Michelle?

192
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,152
No. What about Lily and Michelle?

193
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,241
Oh, my friend,
you are in for a treat.

194
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,022
- Hey, Lil?
- What?

195
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,831
You know, I was just thinking, we haven't
seen your friend Michelle in a while.

196
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,961
Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call,
see if she wants to hang out.

197
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,550
What...
Do they make out?

198
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:28,790
Better.

199
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:30,531
- Comparable.
- Comparable.

200
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:33,182
Whatever.
It's over. I lost.

201
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,852
I guess you, uh,
you don't get second chance.

202
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,441
- I got a second chance.
- What happened?

203
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:40,980
He came by my place tonight...

204
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,561
Simon.
What are you doing here?

205
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:47,862
I just feel like there's some
unfinished business between you and me.

206
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:50,270
Seeing you now...

207
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,550
has made me realize
that breaking up with you

208
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,740
is the biggest mistake
I made in my entire life.

209
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:57,913
Oh, I like where this is going.

210
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,762
I know this is crazy,

211
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,420
and I'm only in town
for a couple of days, but,

212
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:04,870
do you want to go on a date?

213
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:08,553
He asked you out?!
Oh, step into my web, Simon.

214
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:09,632
The coup de grace.

215
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,053
Finish him!

216
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,762
I'd love to!

217
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:22,432
Wait. You're going on
a date with Simon?

218
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,643
That Simon? The one we met?

219
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:27,272
Robin, this guy doesn't
deserve a second chance.

220
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,360
Not after the way he treated you.

221
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:32,182
That was ten years ago.
People evolve.

222
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:35,361
I mean, are you the same person
that you were in high school?

223
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:39,081
- Oh, hell, no!
- I think you're gonna enjoy this.

224
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:40,873
That my girl Michelle?

225
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,582
- Bitch, you know it!
- How she livin'?

226
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:47,281
She living only way she know
how to. Large!

227
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:49,542
Oh, girl, you gots to get
your drink on up in here.

228
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,632
I'm hoping my fat ass can
hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.

229
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,453
For reals.

230
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:00,853
I want her around all the time.

231
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,020
I'd even consider not trying to sleep
with her if that's what it takes.

232
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,813
Guys, I've decided
to seduce Michelle.

233
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:20,011
Guys, that was great.
Let's take five.

234
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:23,510
Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass
solo when I flicked my pick at you?

235
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,581
That rocked.

236
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,503
Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need
that pick back.

237
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,290
Oh, uh, sure. Um...

238
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,551
- It's cool. You'll find it later.
- Oh, cool.

239
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:35,632
I wish I didn't have to go
to work in the morning.

240
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,053
But, babe, you got to go to work.

241
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:39,363
You got to play our demo
on your show.

242
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,310
Oh, well, you know, it's not
a show. It's the news.

243
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,482
Right. So you can be, like,
"Hey, did you hear there's some news?

244
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,312
There's a rad band you guys
should check out." And then play it.

245
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:51,023
Or just, like, the first three songs.

246
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:54,721
And now it's time
for "Puppy Corner,"

247
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,560
some little angels
looking for a new home,

248
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,813
courtesy of
the Midtown Animal Shelter.

249
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:06,560
<i># Murder climb aboard
the Murder Train #</i>

250
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:14,051
<i># Murder climb aboard
the Murder Train #</i>

251
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:18,291
Hey, a lot of puppies
got adopted.

252
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,683
Of course, a lot of
the people calling in

253
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:22,103
thought we were going
to kill them.

254
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:26,031
Robin, your revertigo is really
starting to affect your work.

255
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,060
What's revertigo?

256
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:28,892
It's a stupid, made-up word
with no meaning.

257
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:32,631
No. It's a phenomenon where, when
you're around people from your past,

258
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,370
you start behaving like them.

259
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:38,102
Oh. One example of that
springs to mind.

260
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,611
I think we all know what it is.

261
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:42,140
You do?

262
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:43,663
Yeah. Ted.

263
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:44,673
Me?

264
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:46,980
Whenever Ted's friend Punchy
comes into town,

265
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,891
it's like, all of a sudden,
Ted's in high school again.

266
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:54,711
Okay, okay. First of all, his name is
Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.

267
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,303
Ooh. That must be Adam.

268
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,391
- 'Sup, Punchy?
- 'Sup, Shmosby?!

269
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,113
- You want to go?
- I'm already there!

270
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,181
- Come on!
- This is it!

271
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:11,061
Dude, seriously,
I'm sorry about your dad.

272
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,421
Yeah, it was a real shock.

273
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:16,781
I can't believe you, of all people,
are saying this.

274
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:17,793
Why?

275
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:19,300
No reason.

276
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:21,960
Robin, the point is,

277
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,573
what are you doing?
I mean, this guy?

278
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,283
Okay, you want the truth?

279
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:28,823
I like Simon.

280
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,251
I do. We have fun together.

281
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:34,132
We know you do, honey,
but we're worried about you.

282
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:36,982
You're worried?
Okay, hold on.

283
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:38,861
Is there any version
of this conversation

284
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,633
where you guys don't sound
like my parents?

285
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,980
I don't know.

286
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,640
Is there any version where
you don't sound like a 16-year-old?

287
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,361
That's exactly what
my mom would say.

288
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:52,100
No. If I was your mom, I would say,
"We forbid you from seeing this boy."

289
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:55,481
No, I'm sorry,
but it's for your own good.

290
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,181
This is my life!

291
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:59,990
You guys just don't get it!
You've never felt the way that I feel!

292
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:02,490
No, no. We were once young
and in love, too.

293
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:05,620
Yeah, like, a billion years ago.

294
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,333
You've been drinking,
haven't you?

295
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:10,622
Yeah, we all have.
You bought the last round.

296
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,122
You're not going
to that show tonight!

297
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:15,320
Oh, yes, I am,
and you know what else?

298
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:18,852
Tonight, after the show,
Simon and I are going all the way!

299
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:20,960
Young lady, get back here!

300
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:23,762
Thanks for your help.

301
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,852
- Hey, so, today at work...
- Not now, Ted!

302
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:37,661
Hey, Simon. Great show.

303
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:39,981
- You guys still rock.
- Yeah.

304
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,041
They totally dug
my bass solo.

305
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:43,820
Man!

306
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,162
Why can't I always
feel this alive?!

307
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:51,491
God, I just love
seeing you so happy.

308
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:54,231
Yeah. About that.

309
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,070
Listen, babe.

310
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:57,920
It's over.

311
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,131
What?

312
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:01,383
I'm getting back together
with Louise Marsh.

313
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:04,721
What?
You're kidding me.

314
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,550
You're breaking up with me?

315
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:09,290
Again?

316
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:12,970
F-For the same ex-girlfriend?
In the same van?

317
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,903
What is it?
Her-Her parents got a pool?

318
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:16,272
Is that still the reason?

319
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,881
Well...

320
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,420
her folks did just
put in a Jacuz.

321
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,531
I'm sorry, Robin.

322
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:27,820
I'm fine, really.

323
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,203
Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you
for real. Simon's a dawg.

324
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:34,980
- You feel me, Chelle?
- Mm-hmm, for reals.

325
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:37,441
- He a scrub.
- Mm. True dat.

326
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:39,711
I'm get me my champagne
and grape soda on.

327
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,710
So, how's Columbia?

328
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,713
Great!

329
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,013
I'm almost done
with my dissertation.

330
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm getting a PhD
in behavioral psychology.

331
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:52,560
Can I make an observation?

332
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:53,761
I know.

333
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:57,201
Whenever I'm around Lily,
she just brings out that side of me.

334
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,950
There's a psychological term
for the phenomenon.

335
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:00,593
- Revertigo?
- No.

336
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,482
Actually, it's associative regression.

337
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,150
You see,
the neural pathways that...

338
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:09,743
Oh, no, you did not just
put on my jam!

339
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,730
Oh. Put your hands up, girl!

340
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:17,962
<i>One by one,
we all had to go home.</i>

341
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,673
<i>Soon, it was just Robin.</i>

342
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,693
All right.
I can't find your video.

343
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:35,720
I've wasted three days tr...

344
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:38,681
What's the matter?

345
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:46,573
Simon dumped me
in his van after the show.

346
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,741
Yeah, Robin, that was, like,
ten years ago.

347
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:51,341
No, tonight.

348
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,740
Really?

349
00:16:56,897 --> 00:16:58,911
Oh, come here.

350
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,510
Come here.

351
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:05,770
It's just...

352
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:08,960
when I was young,
I was so...

353
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,642
vulnerable and-and open
to things, you know?

354
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:13,670
And...

355
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,530
I guess I just...

356
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:17,820
I wanted to feel
that way again.

357
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,812
I wanted to be 16 again.

358
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:23,061
Robin,

359
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:26,702
that is the stupidest thing I've
ever heard come out of your mouth.

360
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,280
You want to be 16 again?

361
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:32,781
I have watched your first
Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times,

362
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,493
and it's not because
I'm proud of you as a friend.

363
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:38,973
It's because you were totally,
totally lame back then.

364
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:42,043
But now, come on. Pa-cow!

365
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,710
You're the most awesome person
I have ever known.

366
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:46,431
Well, second most awesome.

367
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:49,152
Right. Of course,
the-the first being you.

368
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:49,971
No.

369
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:54,351
No. The first is this guy who
lives in a place called the mirror.

370
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,970
What up.

371
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:58,772
I'm saying

372
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,943
that you are way more awesome
than Simon ever will be.

373
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,650
Barney, do you want
to come back to my place?

374
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:11,323
Your place?

375
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,170
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Yeah. I am.

376
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,712
Let's just not tell anyone
about this, okay?

377
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:27,792
Of course.

378
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:32,762
So, should I just put it in?

379
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:34,613
Yeah, why not?

380
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:52,691
<i># Met you at the mall... #</i>

381
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:57,243
This was my big artistic follow-up
to "Let's Go to the Mall."

382
00:18:58,545 --> 00:19:00,291
It kind of tanked.

383
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,620
<i># My friends said I was a fool #</i>

384
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,250

- Shut up! #</i>

385
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:08,182
- Is that Tiffany?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:11,123
<i># 'Cause you were older and

00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:17,420

<i># From Alberta to Ontario #</i>

390
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:26,202
It's everything I want it to be
and more.

391
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:27,562
- Oh, I'm so glad.
- Hmm.

397
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:46,330

- Yeah.

400
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:58,451
You know, if you reedit it, there's
a tampon commercial in here somewhere.

401
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:04,853
<i># On our favorite bench #</i>

404
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,313
Do you see how lame
you were back then?

405
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,390
- Yeah, you're right. I was lame.
- Totally lame.

408
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,150
And, of course, the robot makes an
appearance in the sad love ballad.

409
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:30,293
He was my sidekick.
He had to be.

410
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,713

421
