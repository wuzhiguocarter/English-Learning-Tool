1
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:06,948
<i>Kids, this is the story of the
cab ride that changed my life.</i>

2
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:08,757
<i>I know it sounds crazy,</i>

3
00:00:08,857 --> 00:00:10,829
<i>but for all I know my life
would be very different</i>

4
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:12,928
<i>if I had taken, say...</i>

5
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:14,490
<i>that cab.</i>

6
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,167
<i>Or that cab.</i>

7
00:00:17,992 --> 00:00:21,933
<i>God knows what would have happened
if I had gotten into that cab.</i>

8
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:27,094
<i>I took this cab.</i>

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,412
<i>And it changed my whole life.</i>

10
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,640
<i>But first,
we need to back up a little.</i>

11
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:43,312
Is there any beer in the fridge?

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,659
It's 10:00 in the morning.

13
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:45,827
Grab me one?

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,091
So... something bad
just happened.

15
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:53,620
Stella and I were out
having breakfast.

16
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:56,662
So, my sister broke up
with her boyfriend.

17
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,163
Well, I can finally say it.
I hated that guy!

18
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:02,010
Everything out of his mouth is,
"I'm a vegan.

19
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:05,662
"Fish feel pain.
I'm never constipated."

20
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,100
The guy's an idiot.

21
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,632
Actually, she's marrying him.
I just wanted your honest opinion.

22
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:14,303
He's actually a really nice guy.
I think there's a wisdom to...

23
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:19,180
Anyway they pick a date so, uh,

24
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,253
you want to come with me,
so that we can laugh our asses off

25
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:23,843
as we watch him walk barefoot
down the aisle in a hemp tuxedo?

26
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,690
- Yeah, sure. When is it?
- First weekend in November.

27
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:30,650
Is that the something bad?
That she invited you to a wedding?

28
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,711
Six months from now.
As in...

29
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:35,032
we'll be together
six months from now.

30
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,240
Do you guys remember Barney's whole thing
about making plans in a relationship?

31
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,160
Fourth row.

32
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,790
Ted, no. You're violating
the date-time continuum.

33
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:46,650
You never make plans with a girl
further in the future

34
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,523
than the amount of time
you've been going out.

35
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,270
You've been dating this girl for,
what, two weeks?

36
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,222
No, you're not taking her
to a Springsteen concert in January.

37
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:59,012
By that time you won't even remember
this Robin girl's name.

38
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:02,130
Man, I love Springsteen!

39
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:04,603
He's like the American Bryan Adams.

40
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:08,273
But Barney had a point.

41
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,280
As soon as she started talking about
the wedding, it freaked me out.

42
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:13,692
Oh, that sounds like so much fun.

43
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:16,670
So I get to look forward
to it for six months.

44
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:18,991
Which is twice as long
as we've been dating.

45
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:23,201
I'm sure your daughter Lucy
will come so it'll be like a...

46
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:24,712
a family trip.

47
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,320
Our first trip
as our funny little family.

48
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:30,381
So that... that'll be super-exciting.

49
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,012
Oh, boy.

50
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:35,181
Man, they crank up the heat
in these places.

51
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:37,973
What's going on, Ted?

52
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,310
We need to talk.

53
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:43,020
- Oh.
- "We need to talk?"

54
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:46,362
There's only two situations where
you say that to someone and

55
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,271
unless you're pregnant,
it sounds like you broke up with her.

56
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,193
Yeah, I did.

57
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,112
So how did she take it?

58
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm only trying
to be honest with you.

59
00:02:58,187 --> 00:02:59,410
You know, Ted.

60
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:01,212
- I have to go to work.
- Stella, can we just...

61
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,001
I don't want to leave it like this.

62
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:04,621
No, Ted, it's okay.

63
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,233
We're good.

64
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,461
Look, I know it sounds rough,

65
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,843
but Stella's a mom.
I have to be responsible.

66
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,832
If I'm having these feelings now,

67
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:17,262
what if they don't go away?

68
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:20,062
What if they just get worse and
worse and six months from now,

69
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,012
I break up with her over
tofu salmon at her sister's wedding?

70
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:26,970
I can't do that to her. And I definitely
can't do that to her daughter.

71
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,901
It sucks, but I'm being
the good guy here.

72
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:33,733
This is the right decision.

73
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,103
<i>Which brings me back
to the cab ride.</i>

74
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:42,972
Hello, may I speak
with Marshall Eriksen?

75
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:43,973
Hey, guys.

76
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:45,352
Jell-O?

77
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:50,090
How I Met Your Mother 3x20
<i>- Miracles -</i>

78
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,190
Can you believe this?
You're totally fine.

79
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:08,613
No, I'm not fine. I made
the biggest mistake of my life.

80
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:12,363
I want Stella back. I've left her
like ten messages, but her phone's off.

82
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:15,610
She's at that arcade
Kiddie Funland with her daughter.

84
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:18,593
Please. Let me go
to Kiddie Funland.

86
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,182
You can say that all you want, buddy,
but you're not getting any morphine.

87
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:24,592
No, I'm serious.
I got to get out of here.

88
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:27,020
You're not going anywhere
until we get the tests back.

89
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,303
You could have internal bleeding.

90
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,403
Your brain could be all full of blood.

91
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,693
Think that's good for it?
It ain't.

92
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:34,273
This sucks.

92
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,273
- This sucks. This sucks.
- Are you...

93
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,111
are you kidding me?

94
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:41,582
You walked away from
a car accident without a scratch.

95
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:44,071
A miracle took place today.

96
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,163
Here we go.

97
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,161
You don't think this was a miracle?

98
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:49,613
There's no such thing as miracles.

99
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,710
March 2006, MacLaren's Bar.

100
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,421
- That's terrible. That's in!
- Gentle. Gentle.

101
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,293
Here we go.

102
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,861
Bravo. Cheers...

103
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:14,942
- No... way.
- That did not just happen.

104
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:16,892
Am I dead?

105
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,892
Am I dead?

106
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,430
Miracle!

107
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:25,110
A pencil went up Barney's nose,
and you call it a miracle.

108
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:27,432
Well, do you have a better
explanation for it?

109
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:29,870
A drunk jackass
with a box of pencils?

110
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:32,281
A drunk jackass called "God!"

111
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,980
And a box of pencils called "destiny!"

112
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,462
Speaking of Barney,
I should give him a call.

113
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:40,483
Why? We're not friends anymore.

114
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:42,673
You'd want to know
if this happened to him.

115
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:45,552
Go for Barney.

116
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:48,683
Hey, Barney. Listen,
I have something to tell you.

117
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,281
Oh, boy, here we go.

118
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:53,483
I've been waiting for this one.
You talked to Robin.

119
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:55,211
She told you
what's under the hood

120
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,113
and you want to take it
for a spin yourself.

121
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:00,023
Not even if you
boiled it in detergent.

122
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,191
It's about Ted.

123
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:04,273
Ted? Ah ah, ah ah.

124
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:07,932
My former best friend Ted who I
asked you never to mention to me again?

125
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:08,823
Yeah.

126
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:12,193
He's been in a car accident.
He's at Saint Anthony's hospital.

127
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:13,410
<i>Everything's...</i>

128
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,592
No, I understand.

129
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:19,750
You've got that important thing.

130
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,050
Okay. Oh, of course...

131
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,581
I'll tell him you love him.
Okay.

132
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,450
Suit up!

133
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:28,890
He is always saying
stuff like that!

134
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,852
- He hung up, didn't he?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:32,813
See, I told you.
We're not friends anymore.

136
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,662
My best friend need me!

137
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:41,582
What did he say?

138
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:44,401
A hundred and thir... What?

139
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:46,550
You... Ah, come on!

140
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:48,291
I'm coming, Ted.

141
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:52,411
So, what made you change
your mind about Stella?

142
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:54,373
Well, I was in the cab,

143
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,910
and the car was coming at me,

144
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:58,582
<i>and you know how they say
that your whole life</i>

145
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,699
<i>flashes before your eyes
in a near-death experience?</i>

146
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:01,637
<i>It doesn't.</i>

147
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:03,661
<i>You don't see everything.</i>

148
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,513
<i>Just the things you love.</i>

149
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:10,562
I realized in that moment that

150
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:14,181
Stella is the most important thing
in my life and I have to get her back.

151
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:15,602
Miracle!

152
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,993
Very sweet.
Very romantic.

153
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:20,602
Not a miracle.

154
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:25,071
July 1999.
Kennedy Airport.

155
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,571
So, did you enjoy...

156
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:30,043
Amsterdam?

157
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,091
No. Nothing illegal.

158
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:34,963
Just a paintings.

159
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:38,832
All right, Bob Marley.
Let's have a conversation.

160
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,690
Shift change.

161
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:51,511
Oh, Amsterdam.

162
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,480
All right.

163
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,143
Float on through, brother.

164
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,153
Miracle!

165
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:06,401
Don't you go into the light!
Don't you do it!

166
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,403
Hey, Mosby,
you got a visitor.

167
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,722
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

168
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:23,003
Can you guys, uh,
give us a minute?

169
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,753
Stella, before you say anything...

170
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:32,470
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

171
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:36,101
- Can we just forget about...
- It's forgotten.

172
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,941
Is this your chart?

173
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:43,250
Okay. Uh-huh.

174
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:44,561
Everything looks good.

175
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,482
I think you can handle it.

176
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,613
Handle what?

177
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:54,071
Aww!

178
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:56,530
This morning he dumped her and now

179
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,043
she's dry-humping him
on a hospital bed.

180
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,063
- Miracle!
- Yeah,

181
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,150
you know, I bet
if you call up the Vatican,

182
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:06,130
they will tell you that most of their
certified miracles involve dry-humping

183
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:06,932
so.

184
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:11,921
April 2008.
Lily's kindergarten classroom.

185
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,202
You're gonna go in there
and beg for your old job back?

186
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,683
That's crazy.
You hated it there.

187
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:20,813
I know, the job market
is just really bad right now.

188
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,692
Hey, kids,

189
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:26,523
who wants Uncle Marshall
to get his old job back?

190
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:31,732
They'll cheer for anything
if you say it like that.

191
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:33,020
Kids,

192
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,400
a super tanker spilled
five million gallons of oil

193
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,703
off the coast of Alaska
this morning!

194
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:44,510
<i>Hello, Marshall.</i>

195
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,022
Mr. Hewitt, I came here to apologize.

196
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:50,212
I'm going to go grab some more glue.
Will you watch them for a sec?

197
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,332
Of course.

198
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:56,080
Leaving Nicholson, Hewitt, and West
was a huge mistake,

199
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:58,640
and I can see that now.
So...

200
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:02,101
who wants to see the big guy
put on these tiny hats?

201
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:07,151
My behavior was disrespectful.

202
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:08,772
It was unprofessional.

203
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:10,751
I'm a pilgrim.

204
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,342
I know it looks like
I have a tiny hat,

205
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:17,280
but in reality, I have
an abnormally large head!

206
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,451
I was going through a stressful time.

207
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,201
I wasn't getting enough sleep.

208
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:28,302
Fourscore and seven years ago,

209
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:31,962
I had a great, big giant head!

210
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:35,490
I had just bought an apartment, and

211
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:39,142
there were some problems. I don't
want to bore you with the details.

212
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:45,391
I only regret that I have but one
giant head to give for my country.

213
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,861
Sir, if you could just see your way
into giving me one more chance,

214
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,443
- I promise...
- Marshall.

215
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,692
I'm willing to give this
a second chance.

216
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,990
I remember my first years
as an attorney.

217
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,983
Why, I don't know how many hours
I spent. I don't think I ever left...

218
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:03,690
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

219
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:05,153
<i>I have lice.</i>

220
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,451
<i>Those little bastards
gave me lice.</i>

221
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,732
<i>God, it itches.
Don't scratch it.</i>

222
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:12,331
<i>You'll look like a fool.
You'll never get your job back.</i>

223
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:15,992
<i>You can scratch,
but just make it subtle.</i>

224
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:18,080
<i>Okay, that's not working.</i>

225
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:20,320
<i>Oh, sweet,
sharp corner of the desk,</i>

226
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:23,542
<i>how I long to rub
my infested scalp against you.</i>

227
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,602
- You okay, Eriksen?
- Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.

228
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:35,870
I am good.
Continue.

229
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:40,303
<i>Mind over matter.
There are no lice in my hair...</i>

230
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:43,681
<i>laying eggs,
burrowing into my scalp,</i>

231
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:46,110
<i>eating their way all the way
down to my brain!</i>

232
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:47,620
I have lice!

233
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,673
"Lice"?! Lice! Get out!
Get out of my office!

234
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:55,780
We've got lice!
Everybody out of the building.

235
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:58,841
If it weren't for the lice,
I would have gotten my job back,

236
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:00,821
and I would have been
working there when,

237
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:04,392
two weeks later, the Securities and
Exchange Commission came a-knocking.

238
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:09,133
God sent those lice to my head
like he sent the locusts to Egypt:

239
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,882
to liberate me
from corporate bondage.

240
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:12,981
Miracle.

241
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:15,643
Hey, guys.

242
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:19,740
I'm just so glad you and Ted
are back together.

243
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,532
Wait, um, what do you mean
"back together?"

244
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:25,953
Well, you know,
since you guys broke up.

245
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:30,161
What? Oh, no. It was just a
small fight. That wasn't a breakup.

246
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,293
Was that a breakup?
Did he think that was a breakup?

247
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:36,501
What?

248
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:39,111
Son of a bitch!

249
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:46,890
That was a breakup. Wasn't it?
You broke up with me.

250
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:48,180
Yeah.

251
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:50,853
I didn't know that was a breakup.

252
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,211
Are you kidding?

253
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:54,623
I said, "I feel awful."
You said,

254
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:56,692
"We're good."
Then you got up and left.

255
00:13:56,897 --> 00:14:00,293
Yeah, I said, "We're good,"
as in "We're good."

256
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:02,903
Like when the waiter comes around
and asks if you want any more muffins,

257
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,263
and you say, "We're good."

258
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,742
Exactly, and I took that
"We're good" to mean

259
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,743
you didn't want any more
metaphorical relationship muffins.

260
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:13,003
This is crazy.

261
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,913
Forget about all that.
That was a whole

262
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,452
life-changing car accident ago.

263
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,422
I love you.
I don't want to break up.

264
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:22,360
But you did.
You did want to.

265
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,803
If you had
those feelings once,

266
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,241
then you're going to have
those feelings again,

267
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:26,682
and you're going to keep
on having them.

268
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:29,430
And I can't count on that car
to hit you every time you do.

269
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:30,852
What are you saying?

270
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,102
I'm saying...

271
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,711
you wanted your breakup,

272
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:36,880
- you got it.
- What?! Stella, wait!

273
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:39,732
No, you know what, Ted?
We're good.

274
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:50,621
So you broke up with her
and she didn't know it.

275
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,121
Apparently.

276
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,710
And you actually said,
"I want to break up?"

277
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:57,270
No, of course not.
Who says "I want to break up?"

278
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,642
That's a horrible thing to say.

279
00:14:58,847 --> 00:14:59,590
Well, that's true.

280
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,371
- Hello?
- Hi, Ted Mosby?

281
00:15:06,478 --> 00:15:10,053
We have you listed as the
emergency contact for Barney Stinson.

282
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:12,532
What is it?

283
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,232
<i>What it was was this.</i>

284
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:24,191
I made it.
I made it!

285
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:33,921
Dude, I...

286
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,711
I can't believe you ran
all the way up here.

287
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:39,882
Jeez. Flatter yourself much?

288
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,412
What an ego on this guy.

289
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:45,372
Um, I was up in this part
of town because

290
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,390
I had to attend a very important
international business meeting.

291
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:54,363
If you're here to come
crawling back, just save it.

292
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,772
I'm doing awesome without you.

293
00:15:57,276 --> 00:16:00,883
Even better now, 'cause I can play
the sympathy card with the females.

294
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:05,362
And BTW, there's one bone
downstairs that ain't broken.

295
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:09,873
Marshall, you know
what I'm talking about.

296
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,450
Up top!

297
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:14,832
Are you sure?

298
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,250
Yeah, dude. Why do you think
I had them set it this way?

299
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:19,583
Okay.

300
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,692
Worth it.

301
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:30,511
Barney, you, uh...

302
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:33,242
You could've died.

303
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,811
Ted, I'm sorry I broke the Bro Code.

304
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,272
No, I'm sorry.

305
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:43,692
Ted, can we be friends again?

306
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,183
Barney, come on, we're...
we're more than friends.

307
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:48,972
We're brothers.

308
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:53,672
- You're my brother, Ted.
- You're my brother, Barney.

309
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:57,722
Did you hear that, Marshall?
We're brothers now.

310
00:16:57,826 --> 00:16:59,671
Marshall's my brother, too.

311
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,751
We're all brothers.

312
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,823
Yeah, but I'm your
best brother, right?

313
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,571
<i>And that's how your Uncle Barney
and I buried the hatchet.</i>

314
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:10,101
<i>It got pretty mushy and
embarrassing after that.</i>

315
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,313
<i>Let's skip ahead.</i>

316
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:13,021
I had to look away because

317
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:15,250
if I watched what
the paramedics were about to do,

318
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:16,861
I would have passed out.

319
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:18,981
Then they took out this electric

320
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,551
blade thing and I kept thinking,

321
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,053
"This isn't happening.
This isn't happening."

322
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:25,982
Oh, my God.
What did they cut?

323
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:30,361
My suit.
My beautiful suit.

324
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:36,702
But you're alive, and, and Ted's alive.
This is amazing!

325
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:39,503
Two miracles in one day.

326
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:43,621
What is the matter with you?

327
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,673
How can you possibly
be this cynical?!

328
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:46,853
You want to know?

329
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,302
You really want to know?

330
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:49,861
Fine.

331
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:52,193
When I was a kid,

332
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:55,260
I had this dog,
Sir Scratchawan.

333
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,980
Anyway, Sir Scratchawan
got really old,

334
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:00,703
so my parents decided
to put him down.

335
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:04,452
<i>It was the
toughest day of my young life.</i>

336
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:06,312
Good-bye, Sir Scratchawan.

337
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:07,732
I love you.

338
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,920
And when they
took him to the vet,

339
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:14,613
he told them that earlier
that very day,

340
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,920
he had learned about
an experimental procedure called

341
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:19,763
a canine/testudine
cerebro-xenograft.

342
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,702
- Ever heard of it?
- No.

343
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,521
Well, it saved
Sir Scratchawan's life.

344
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,002
He lived another seven years.

345
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,132
Miracle.

346
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:30,502
Except for one... kind of big
side effect from the surgery.

347
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:34,382
Sir Scratchawan!
Welcome home!

348
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,510
He turned into a turtle.

349
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:41,723
I know. It's weird, right?

350
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:44,560
Apparently, a very
common complication from

351
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,043
canine/testudine cerebro-xenografts.

352
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,441
And he didn't seem to remember
any of his old tricks.

353
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:54,570
Go get it, Scratchy.
Go get it!

354
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:58,123
Go get it! Get it!
Go get it, Scratchy.

355
00:18:58,326 --> 00:18:59,373
Go get it.

356
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:05,502
- How long was it before...?
- Longer than I'm proud of, Lily.

357
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:07,583
Longer than I'm proud of.

358
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:12,452
And that's when I realized
miracles ain't real.

359
00:19:13,498 --> 00:19:14,493
Excuse me.

360
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,180
Mosby, you're still here?

361
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,601
Your tests came back, like,
an hour ago. You're fine.

362
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,490
Are you kidding me?
Why didn't you tell me?!

363
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:23,971
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,340
I guess it was rude of me to keep
resuscitating that guy

365
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,062
with a rake sticking out of his chest.

366
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:31,521
I have to go right now.
Barney, I...

367
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:32,993
Go.

368
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:35,923
Run, Ted. Run.

369
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:38,663
If there's anything I've taught you
over the years, it's...

370
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,071
Barney, he left.

371
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:44,212
Hey, Ted said that
right before the accident,

372
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,312
his life flashed before his eyes.
You know, all the stuff he loves.

373
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:49,140
- Did that happen to you?
- Oh, yeah.

374
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,793
I know what he saw: boobs.

375
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:52,780
- Scotch.
- And money.

376
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:54,590
- Suits.
- A suit of money.

377
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,220
A suit of boobs.
A giant boob

378
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:58,800
wearing a suit of money.

379
00:19:58,926 --> 00:20:01,852
And the boob is lactating scotch.

380
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:05,450
I guess that's pretty much
everything you love, right?

381
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:08,962
Yeah, pretty much.

382
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,921
<i>Kids, a lot of weird, random things
have happened in my life,</i>

383
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:18,342
<i>but that car accident is one
of the few I'd call a miracle,</i>

384
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,263
<i>not because of what happened,</i>

385
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:22,532
<i>but because of what happened next.</i>

386
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:25,733
Hi.

387
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,080
Hi.

388
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,531
Can I talk to you?

389
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:31,420
Okay.

390
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,571
I got you this orange kangaroo.

391
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:41,073
Thanks.

392
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,851
So I've been thinking
about what changed

393
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,703
from the moment
I broke up with you

394
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:50,540
to the moment I knew
I wanted you back. And, um,

395
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:53,470
I think I finally figured out
what happened.

396
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:56,863
Your cab got T-boned
by a jackass on a cell phone?

397
00:20:57,477 --> 00:20:59,161
I changed.

398
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:01,942
I'm ready to give you
what you need.

399
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:04,023
That's why I spent
ten minutes on the

400
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,623
damn claw machine trying to get
the big, fake diamond ring.

401
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,213
But all I could get
was this orange kangaroo.

402
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:12,903
Diamond ring?

403
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:16,983
Will you marry me?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
