1
00:00:00,616 --> 00:00:02,418
<i>Kids, back when we were younger,</i>

2
00:00:02,538 --> 00:00:05,564
<i>your uncle Marshall and I
were really into college basketball.</i>

3
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:08,641
<i>Every year, March Madness would
take over the entire apartment.</i>

4
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:11,630
- Hey. What's with the blackboard?
- It's our NCAA bracket.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,187
Big board equals big luck!

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,762
Hey, that looks familiar.
Where did you get it?

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,724
Hello.

8
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,414
I'm looking for my wife, Ms. Aldrin.

9
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,636
There's no school today.
It's Saturday.

10
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:27,480
Of course. How could I forget?

11
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:28,602
Dumb ass.

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,419
- Big board!
- Big luck!

13
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,607
We found it.
No big deal.

14
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:45,481
Anyway, every year,
Ted and I go in together on this

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,373
big money pool out in Staten Island.

16
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:50,472
The winner gets
$100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.

17
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:53,242
And you get to keep the duffel bag.

18
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:57,133
Why do you guys put yourselves
through this? You lose every year.

19
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:59,092
That's because in the past,
we were just guessing.

20
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:00,881
This year, we watched every game,

21
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,772
read box scores, tracked injuries.

22
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,300
This isn't March Madness.

23
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:07,340
This is March
Meticulously Thought-outness.

24
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,172
Your team lost 20 minutes ago.

25
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:14,263
I didn't know
they were playing today.

26
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:16,932
You okay, Barney?

27
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,273
Something strange is going on.

28
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:22,640
I was down at the hardware store trying
to get a little somethin' somethin'.

29
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:25,692
Wait. You go to the hardware store
to pick up girls?

30
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:29,042
There are four kinds of women who go
to the hardware store by themselves.

31
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:30,280
Of course there are.

32
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:34,163
Single, recently single,
recently divorced,

33
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,993
lesbian who will let me watch.

34
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:37,700
You could not be more evil.

35
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:40,581
Sorry. Five.
Recently widowed.

36
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,502
So, I'm talking to this girl...

37
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,423
Look, I'm sure he's in a better place.

38
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,381
Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.

39
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:53,421
I was only gone for a second when...

40
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:55,613
See? Skid-proof.

41
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:01,392
The same thing happened
at the pet store yesterday.

42
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:02,483
Pet store?

43
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:05,671
Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for
a canine replacement for the boyfriend

44
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:07,981
who just dumped her.
Instead, finds Barney.

45
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,901
God bless you, Ted.
You're reading my blog.

46
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:14,241
I'm really bored at work.

47
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:18,873
I'd call your ex a dog, but that would
be an insult to little Ladybug here.

48
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:20,793
I want to take her home right now.

49
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,410
Not without a chew toy
from Uncle Barney first.

50
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:28,861
<i>And when I got back...</i>

51
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:32,752
I'm sorry, I'm already spoiling her,
but, Diamond in the ruff?

52
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:34,173
Could your heart just melt?

53
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,133
Jerk!

54
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:38,541
Weird, right?

55
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:42,181
The same thing happened
last week at the museum.

56
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:43,851
Lily.

57
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:47,062
You pretend to be a struggling
young artist who needs a new muse.

58
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:48,750
No. Marsh.

59
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,310
You're a millionaire art thief
casing the joint for a thrill

60
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,900
money can no longer give you!

61
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:53,940
Oh. No. Robin.

62
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,311
You're going blind, and you're trying
to soak up all the beauty in the world

63
00:02:57,415 --> 00:02:58,782
before the darkness descends.

64
00:02:58,908 --> 00:02:59,672
Bingo!

65
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:01,950
So, I was talking to this girl.

66
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:04,662
At this point, about 83%.

67
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:08,583
Soon, these audio guides
will be all that I have left.

68
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,792
I'm so sorry.

69
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:15,300
My God, you are beautiful.

70
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:21,393
How about I get you a headset so
you can see with your ears like I do?

71
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,822
<i>I couldn't have been gone more than
20 seconds, but when I came back...</i>

72
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:34,403
I also love the smell of great art.

73
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,500
Why does this keep happening?

74
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:42,421
Maybe you're not as good a liar
as you think you are.

75
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:45,903
Oh, really? Then why am I not
in prison for perjury?

76
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:47,410
But I don't want to talk about work.

77
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:51,333
Something weird is going on here.

78
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:54,003
<i>But the next night
got even weirder.</i>

79
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:57,671
Alan Alda.
It was Alan Alda.

80
00:03:57,877 --> 00:03:59,680
You never gonna believe
what just happened.

81
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,262
Who was that, um,
guy from Mash?

82
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:06,610
The main guy. What...?

83
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,691
Hawkeye from Mash.
How can I be blanking on this?

84
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:09,901
Alan Alda?

85
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:11,372
No.

86
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:17,283
<i>Hey, a word of advice?</i>

87
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:19,680
<i>That guy you were talking to,
Barney Stinson...</i>

88
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,043
<i>I know he seems charming,</i>

89
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:23,390
<i>but he's just saying whatever
it takes to get in your pants.</i>

90
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:26,452
<i>Sleeping with Barney was
the biggest mistake of my life.</i>

91
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:31,810
Oh, my God.
Where is she?

92
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:35,342
She must have left.

93
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:37,961
Well, she-she said
I hooked up with her?

94
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,260
What was her name?
What did she look like?

95
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:43,110
She didn't say her name,
but she had blonde hair, boobs.

96
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,973
Kind of trashy.

97
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,390
Dead in the eyes with an aura of
self-loathing and despair?

98
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:48,813
That's all of them.

99
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:50,893
Okay. Stay calm.

100
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:52,723
Let's think this through.

101
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:57,601
One of the girls who I lied to, seduced
and abandoned is trying to ruin my life.

102
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:00,480
Shouldn't be too hard
to figure out which one it is.

103
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,382
Oh, dear God!

104
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:16,463
How I Met Your Mother 3x14
<i>- The Bracket -</i>

105
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:27,933
This is a nightmare.

107
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:31,240
Some woman that I slept with and
screwed over is trying to ruin my life.

108
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:32,861
God, why is this happening to me?

109
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:33,813
It's Karma.

110
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:35,671
Nah, it's not Karma.

112
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:39,112
She's strippg in Vegas.
Plus, we're good.

114
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:42,233
Look, if you want to figure out
who it is, why don't you just

115
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,451
start by checking your list?

116
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:44,820
My list?

117
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,971
Dude, do not pretend
you're not the kind of guy

118
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,042
who keeps a list of all the girls
he's slept with.

119
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:51,600
I have one.

120
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:54,620
It's called my marriage license.

121
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,743
Come on, let's see the list.

122
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,673
Ted, don't be crass.

123
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,401
I would never demean
the women that I've slept with

124
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:04,473
by putting their names
on some tawdry list.

125
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:06,913
This is a scrapbook of all of
the women I've slept with.

126
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:11,470
I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th.
Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you.

127
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,471
What do you think, Lil?

128
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,150
You recognize the saboteur?

129
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,821
I don't know, Barney.
I only saw her face.

130
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,851
How many of these girls know
they're being photographed?

131
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,632
All of them, but only about half
buy a copy on the way out.

132
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:29,923
Barney, you're never gonna figure out
which one of these is the mystery woman.

133
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,951
All of these women
have a right to hate you.

134
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:34,383
Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up.
I mean, any girl

135
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:38,153
who's gonna be with a guy
like Barney and do this or

136
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:42,411
that, or this and that,
or do this with those in that...

137
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,771
I mean, she should have known
what she was getting into.

138
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:46,462
Absolutely.

139
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,973
And what I do with these women
should be between me and them.

140
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:53,062
And you guys.

141
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:56,563
And Heloise.
She helped me do the decoupage.

142
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:59,230
I don't know, Barney.
I don't recognize any of these women.

143
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,210
I mean, some minor celebrities,
one government official,

144
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,752
and what appears to be
a national fast food chain mascot.

145
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,399
This is impossible.

146
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,917
There's too many girls.

147
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:13,541
How the hell am I gonna
narrow this down?

148
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:17,170
The top 64 women I've slept with,
split into four regions.

149
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,600
This tournament will
systematically narrow down

150
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,800
which girl has the most cause
to hate my guts.

151
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,841
Last girl standing
has to be the saboteur.

152
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:27,101
Absolutely not, Barney.
We are not going to make a game out

153
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:29,341
of the women you've tricked
into sleeping with you.

154
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:34,850
No way!

155
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,521
The girl who thought
he had 12 hours to live

156
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,392
has way more cause to ruin his life

157
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:40,741
than the girl he fake proposed to.

158
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:42,812
It's fake proposal girl.

159
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,901
I mean, she hired a wedding planner!

160
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,363
It's 12 hours to live!
That girl flew them both to Paris!

161
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,283
Oh, she only bought him
a one-way ticket!

162
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:52,532
Okay, okay, everybody!
Hands.

163
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,283
12 hours to live!

164
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:55,430
Damn it!

165
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,280
Okay, toss up.

166
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:01,672
"Thought I was Jorge Posada,"
or "You have my dead wife's kidney?"

167
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,632
- Kidney!
- Jorge Posada!

168
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:06,132
She bought Yankees season tickets
to watch him play!

169
00:08:06,337 --> 00:08:07,983
- That's true...
- It's "Dead wife's kidney."

170
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,933
How are we even discussing this?

171
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:14,983
- Fake baby!
- Lost at sea!

172
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:17,310
I was there.
Trust me.

173
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,243
It's fake baby.

174
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,433
Down to the sweet 16.

175
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:24,012
And coming out
of the Upper West Side,

176
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:27,200
we have the number three seed,
"Girl who thought I owned Google,"

177
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:31,113
up against the number seven seed, "Girl
who thought I was a scuba instructor."

178
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:33,782
- You got to go scuba instructor.
- You're kidding me!

179
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,381
- She got the bends!
- Yeah, she did.

180
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,352
Boo.

181
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:42,892
- Evil twin!
- Prince of Norway!

182
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:46,421
- How could it not be Prince of Norway?!
- Barney, you're the tiebreaker.

183
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:49,593
- I'm going with Evil Twin.
- You're kidding me!

184
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:54,720
Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl
twice. As Barney and Larney.

185
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:03,252
Okay, we're down to the Final Four.

186
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,691
What do you think, people?
Come on, dig deep.

187
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:09,032
Oh! I can't decide.
It could be any one of them.

188
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:12,413
Is that the blackboard
from my classroom?

189
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,280
Come on! Marshall?

190
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:17,203
I'm tired and sad.

191
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:18,703
Mosby?

192
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,731
I want to call my mom,

193
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:23,460
just tell her I love her.

194
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,762
Then this is as far as we get.

195
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:30,301
The Final Four.

196
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:33,710
It's got to be Meg, Anna,

197
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,400
Kate or Holly.

198
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:38,321
We are gonna track these girls down,

199
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:40,853
and you're going to tell me which one
approached you at the bar.

200
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,102
You guys stole my blackboard!

201
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,561
Okay, there's her building.

202
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,642
When she comes out,
I'm gonna hide,

203
00:09:53,747 --> 00:09:56,122
and once you figure out if she's
the girl from the bar, we run like hell.

204
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,162
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

205
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,203
That woman, like every woman
in your Final Four,

206
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:03,870
deserves an apology, and I'm not
telling you if she's the one

207
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:05,672
until I hear you say, "I'm sorry."

208
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:07,303
Are you nuts?

209
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:10,312
That would involve me speaking to
a woman I've already had sex with,

210
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:13,880
which, frankly, is a little bit like
changing the oil in a rental car.

211
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,761
Barney, you're doing this.

212
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,840
Lily, this girl hates me.

213
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:20,691
I hooked up with her in an apartment
I was pretending was my own,

214
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:23,353
told her I loved her,
and then ditched her there.

215
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:27,312
She got arrested for trespassing,
bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail.

216
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:31,613
Oh, crap, there she is!
If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!

217
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:34,453
Here's what we're gonna do.
Hey, Meg! Over here!

218
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:37,951
Look who it is!
Your old friend Barney!

219
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:42,162
Barney?

220
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,273
If she kills me,
I want you to go into my apartment,

221
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:48,371
grab the metal briefcase under my bed
and throw it in the East River.

222
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:49,971
What are you doing here?

223
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,341
Look, Meg, we need to talk.

224
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,361
It was all my fault.

225
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:57,643
I know it was, baby.

226
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:59,642
I just came on too strong.

227
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:01,922
And I forgive you.

228
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:03,602
I love you.

229
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,561
Oh, my God!
I love you, too!

230
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:13,151
No! What's the matter with you?
Get off of him!

231
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,802
Look, she's not the one,
but you still owe her an apol...

232
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,580
So you remember who
this one is, right?

233
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,170
Yes. You told her you were Ted
and that you were an architect.

234
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:32,633
Right, and if you recall, her computer
had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...

235
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:34,602
Yeah, I know, Barney,
you showed me.

236
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,093
And that still doesn't count
as a Christmas present.

237
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,683
Go over there
and apologize.

238
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:42,530
Ah, there she is.

239
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:45,562
Ooh, and she's holding hot coffee.
Maybe she'll throw it in your face.

240
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:48,940
- You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
- I'm making a scrapbook.

241
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:54,361
Anna, hi.

242
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:57,360
Look who it is,
Mr. Big Shot Architect.

243
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,671
If you're here to ask me
to take down the Web site, forget it.

244
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:03,542
- What Web site?
- Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.

245
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:07,753
You're right, I do deserve that.

246
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,932
That's all I came here to say.

247
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,502
You know what?

248
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:16,342
I don't care who knows about it.
Excuse me.

249
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:19,683
Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby,

250
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,900
am a jerk to women.

251
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:27,062
Tell your sisters.
Tell your daughters to stay away!

252
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,903
Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.

253
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:37,781
<i>And that little Web site went on
to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney.</i>

254
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,621
Which one is this again?

255
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,662
Larney! Die!

256
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,451
- Is it her?
- Die!

257
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:51,543
Smile.

258
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:56,580
<i>You look good.
Have you lost weight?</i>

259
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:03,581
We're down to the number one seed.

260
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,313
I knew it was Holly.
It had to be Holly.

261
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:08,932
Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.

262
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,941
Barney, did you hear that?
Somebody's stealing my truck.

263
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:22,381
Barney?

264
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,333
Barney!

265
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,820
That is the worst thing
you've ever done.

266
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:37,290
That's the worst thing
anyone has ever done.

267
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:41,423
But in my defense,
she was kind of annoying.

268
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,782
She's gonna kill you.

269
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,523
- Barney.
- Holly.

270
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,140
Mark, come over here.

271
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:56,331
Barney, this is my fiancé, Mark.

272
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:57,400
Barney?

273
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,650
You're the Barney
who ditched her in the woods?

274
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,510
So you're not mad at Barney?

275
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:08,660
Don't you want an apology?

276
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,753
An admission of guilt?

277
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,332
Your truck back?

278
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:14,891
No, whatever happened was in the past.

279
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:17,463
And Mark is my present and my future.

280
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,872
And if you ditching Holly
in the woods

281
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:22,263
made her stop running around
with guys like you,

282
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,990
then cheers.

283
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,780
Well then, to the last
Fourth of July weekend

284
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:29,892
I'll spend getting eaten alive
by mosquitoes.

285
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,680
Fourth of July?

286
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,902
We started dating in June.

287
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:41,193
We ruined their lives.

288
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:42,781
And the worst part of it

289
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:45,543
is that you didn't apologize
to any of those women.

290
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:48,620
No, the worst part is that we still
have no idea who my stalker is.

291
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:51,300
Well, that's because
you're going about this all wrong.

292
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,463
I mean, why chase someone
who's following you?

293
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,100
All you need to do
is go down to the bar,

294
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,430
hit on someone,
and wait until she turns up.

295
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:00,840
That's not a bad idea.

296
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,592
I'll pretend to be the girl
that you're hitting on.

297
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:07,271
I don't know. That's a lot riding on
a girl who giggles when she lies.

298
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,222
I do not.

299
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,380
Have you ever fallen asleep
while eating ribs?

300
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:11,811
No.

301
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,873
Look, I can do this, okay?

302
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:20,191
I mean, how else are you going
to find out who this girl is.

303
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,073
- I'm in.
- Okay,

304
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:24,113
here's how it's gonna work.
Now Lily,

305
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,161
<i>she knows what you look like,</i>

306
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:29,993
<i>so just hang out at the jukebox, and
don't draw any attention to yourself.</i>

307
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,623
<i>And the guys will be in the booth,</i>

308
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:39,681
<i>just pretending to have
a normal conversation.</i>

309
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:43,821
-Talking, we should be talking.
- Words. Here are words.

310
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:45,381
Why is this so hard?

311
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,022
Laughter!

312
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:51,930
<i>And then I'll come in,
looking hot as all hell.</i>

313
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,992
Wow, you are gorgeous.

314
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,400
- God, I know that's awful. I....
- Shh, go away.

315
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:04,282
But come back later.

316
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:09,871
<i>And then Barney will make his move.</i>

317
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:12,083
Hey, there,
how are you doing?

318
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,702
Fine, Barney.
I mean, um, fine, stranger.

319
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,253
Wow, you really are awful
at this, aren't you?

320
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,280
Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.

321
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,960
It's supposed to look like
we're about to hook up, Robin.

322
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,263
You know I'm curious.

323
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,680
What do you say to these girls
to get them to come home with you?

324
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:35,223
Usually I just lean in and whisper
this one thing in their ear.

325
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:46,891
You're a little turned on
right now, aren't you?

326
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,113
No.

327
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:53,812
Look, somebody's watching us.
Make your move to the bathroom.

328
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:56,083
I'm going to go to the bathroom now,

329
00:16:56,188 --> 00:17:00,170
but, uh, when I come back
we'll go to my place and have sex.

330
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:07,463
Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl
heading over to Robin right now.

331
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:08,653
We are go.

332
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:12,513
I don't know what to do with my hands.
What do I normally do with my hands?

333
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:20,851
I brought a copy of the bracket.
Which one is she?

334
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:25,980
I don't recognize her.
She's not on the Top 64.

335
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:27,723
Not even on bracket.

336
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:30,992
Wow, Cinderella story comes out
of nowhere to win the whole thing.

337
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:32,621
That'll warm your heart.

338
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:33,800
Are you okay?

339
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,740
I don't even recognize her.

340
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,480
I don't remember you.

341
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:45,323
I've spent the last two days
trying to remember

342
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:47,670
every girl that I've slept with
and all the horrible things

343
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:48,922
that I have done to them.

344
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:52,303
And I have done some
horrible things. I mean,

345
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:54,931
at one point, I'm pretty sure
I sold a woman.

346
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,211
I didn't speak the language, but,

347
00:17:58,315 --> 00:17:59,752
I shook a guy's hand,

348
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:01,943
he gave me the keys to a Mercedes,
and I left her there.

349
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:05,982
I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook

350
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:07,923
of all of the women
I have slept with,

351
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:10,600
but I never thought I was the guy
who would sleep with a girl

352
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:12,370
and not even remember her.

353
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:15,410
So from the bottom of my heart,
for whatever I did to you,

354
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:17,011
I apologize.

355
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:22,331
Oh, Barney!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

356
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:23,831
That's not her.

357
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:26,140
- I'm so sorry.
- What? What?

358
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,533
Barney, I'm sorry,
that's my friend Sally from work.

359
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:29,983
We just ran into each other.

360
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,341
So I apologized for nothing?

361
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,693
Yes, but it was a great apology.

362
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:37,262
And a perfect way to end my scrapbook.

363
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,790
I'm going to call this photo
"Barney's Redemption."

364
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,583
Could you stop giving me the finger?

365
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:50,373
# One shining moment you
reached for the sky #

366
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:55,132
# One shining moment you knew #

367
00:18:55,235 --> 00:19:00,293
# One shining moment you
were willing to try #

368
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:03,252
# One shining moment #

369
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:06,732
<i>Eventually, Barney did figure out
who the mysterious girl was.</i>

370
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:08,603
<i>But more on that later.</i>

371
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:22,531
<i>Sometimes we search for one thing but
discover another.</i>

372
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:25,782
<i>Even through I didn't find</i>

373
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:29,523
<i>the mystery girl...</i>

374
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:37,623
<i>I did find out something</i>

375
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:41,142
<i>very important about myself...</i>

376
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:44,161
Barney, come back to bed.

377
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,622
You have a shuttle launch tomorrow.

378
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,831
And that asteroid
that's headed for Manhattan,

379
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:52,090
it's not going to destroy itself.

380
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:57,682
<i>I'm awesome.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
