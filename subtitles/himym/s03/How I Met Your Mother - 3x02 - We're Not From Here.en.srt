00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,260
different, not different?
married--

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,000
it's the same. mostly.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,860
except i think i might
be getting carpal tunnel.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,800
my hand keeps
cramping up.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,660
i thought the whole point
of getting married was

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,360
that you didn't have
to do that anymore.

7
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,900
no, it's from writing
all the thank you notes.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,900
mostly.
yeah.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,700
you're writing
constantly.

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,700
there's forms we
have to sign,

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,730
our death folders,

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,830
thank you notes.
whoa, whoa.

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,160
what are death folders?

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,600
it's this thing they
recommend you do

15
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,460
in case one spouse
dies unexpectedly.

16
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,660
it's all
the information

17
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,800
your spouse might need

18
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,500
all in one convenient
location.

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,630
lily:
yeah.

20
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,600
account info,
important addresses,

21
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,260
a letter to the
other person.

22
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,330
all that stuff.

23
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,500
i'll get the next round.

24
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,500
thanks.

25
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,930
i am such a jerk.

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,130
yeah.

27
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,660
wait, why?

28
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,660
i didn't know that i was
supposed to write a letter.

29
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,030
all lily's gonna find

30
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,530
in that folder are a bunch
of bank statements

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,500
and a funny list of things to do
with my ashes.

32
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,360
marshall brownies.

33
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,500
number six.
yeah.

34
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,830
oh, god, i am a bad husband.

35
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,830
no, uh, no, i'll just write,

36
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,860
i'll write lily a letter
tonight, everything'll be fine.

37
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,000
that's right.

38
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,760
unless...

39
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,130
you die between
now and then.
ooh.

40
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,430
but...

41
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,800
come on, that's never
gonna happen.
yes!

42
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,300
if there's one thing
we can state

43
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,800
with absolute certainty

44
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,300
it's that marshall eriksen
is not going to die

45
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
before writing
that letter.

46
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,900
barney:
no way at all.

47
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,700
in fact, i dare god

48
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,700
to smite down this
perfectly healthy...

49
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,930
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

50
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,530
i get it.

51
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,200
okay, you guys know
i'm a little superstitious,

52
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,800
and you guys are trying
to freak me out.

53
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,230
well, guess what?
it didn't work.

54
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,400
so, there.

i mean down here everybody

70
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,700

71
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,030
if we run out of fish,

72
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,760
i will catch more

76
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,630
let's go watch!

77
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,530
and here i am
at the drum circle.

78
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
whoa, are you topless?

79
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,160
ted, check this out.

80
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,660
seen 'em.

81
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,460
wow, it seems
like a great trip.

82
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,760
oh, it was.

83
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,130
i feel like
the robin who left

84
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,660
is not the same robin
who came back, you know.

85
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,500
wow, there's a lot
of nude people in here.

86
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,630
you haven't changed,

87
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,800

a massage-giving,

93

ex-boyfriend, gael.

96
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,300
back me up here, ted.

97
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,900
i'm just happy
robin's happy.

98
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,300
thank you.
lily:
man,

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,630
this is like a
"where's waldo"

100
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,100
of exposed genitalia.

101
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,330
except that it's really
easy to find waldo.

102
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,430
i'm evolved...

103
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,730
and i'm enjoying
living my life

104
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,360
a little bit closer
to the way gael

105
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,360
and i did
in argentina.
please.

106
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,530
vacation romances have
an expiration date.

107
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,660
gael's got a "best if
banged by" sticker on him.

108
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,900
once your romance

109
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,000
starts to stink,
you'll dump his ass

110
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,660
down the drain
like sour milk

111
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,660
and go back to being
"unevolved robin,"

112
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,230
the one we actually like.

113
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,560
back me up here, ted.

114
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,330
i'm just happy
robin's happy.

115
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,330
i'm telling you,

116
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
ooh, here he comes.
switched to big words.

117
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,760
within a triad
of solar periods,

118
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,400
you'll recognize your dearth

119
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,330
of compatibility
with your paramour

120
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,530
and conclude your association.

121
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,760
my journey
was transformative.

122
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,030
and i reassert
my commitment

123
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,860
to both
the aforementioned paramour

124
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,030
and the philosophies
he espouses.

125
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,360
what are we
talking of?

126
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,060
baseball?

127
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,230
this is all gonna return to
masticate you in the gluteals.

128
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,100
support my hypothesis, ted.

129
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,600
i'm just jubilant my former
paramour's jubilant.

130
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,360
to write the letter

131
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,530

and the shark...

160
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,300
he was getting closer.

until the hospital.

169

that guy.
yeah.

170

that guy.

171
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,730
look at how easy
he has it.

172
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,900
you and me, we have
to bend over backwards

173
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,230
to get a woman to, well,
bend over backwards.

174
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,260
but that guy...

is hanging

176

mispronounced word.

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,760

178
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,760
he's better
looking than us.

179
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,200
no.

180
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,860

out of town.

181
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,100
mmm.

182
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
with and accent
and an innocent smile,

183
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,000
you don't even
have to try.
yeah.

184
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,300
plus automatic out,

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
you're leaving in
a couple of days.

186
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,230
god, i wish we
were tourists.
yeah.

187
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,360
actually...

188
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,900
you know where i've been
meaning to visit?

189
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,800
(camera shutter clicking)
okay, okay, we're
from a small town

190
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,900
in the south
of france.

191
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,930
our plane leaves
sunday morning.

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,530
(with southern accent):
uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies.

193
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,560
hate to bother you.

194
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,900
we seem to be
a little bit lost.

195
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,130
would you happen to know
which street

196
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,700
the statue
of liberty's on?

197
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,460
actually,
it's on its own island.

198
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,260
oh!
oh, it's right...

199
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,200

209
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
ah, never mind.
no...

210
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,400
no, what is it?

211
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,830
well...

212
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,230
it's just we're leaving
sunday morning.

213
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,800
it sure would be nice to
have some real new yorkers

214
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,230
show us around.
yeah.

215
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,560
well, we're busy
tonight, but...

216
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,130
maybe tomorrow
afternoon?

217
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,230
after lunch?

218
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,730
well, hotdog!

219
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,900
should we...

220
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,030
you want to just
meet here

221
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,230
in front of mac...
maclaren's pub?

222
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,060
it's kind of a
lame bar, but sure.

223
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,930
really? it doesn't
seem that lame to me.

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,830
it's pretty lame.

225
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
i think it's cool.

226
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,500
we'll see you
tomorrow.
barney:
all right.

227
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,300
i'm just saying it seems like
a kind of bar

228
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,660
a lot of cool people
would ng out at.

229
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,700
okay, all right.

230
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,200
so, gael, huh?
mmm.

231
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,460
still going strong?

232
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,960
yeah, it's great.

233
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,760
amazing, fantastic, awesome.

234
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,860
ooh, that's one too many.

235
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,930
what's going on?

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,800
well, now that i'm home,

237
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,000
i'm finding myself
getting annoyed

238
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,260
at things that i loved
on vacation.

239
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,930
here, taste.

240
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,960
experience your food.

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,930
oh.

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,930
so good.

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,660
here, taste.

244
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,330
experience your food.

245
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
ooh, sofa,
ooh, sofa.

246
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,630
sofa, sofa, oh.

247
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,800
(grunts)

248
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,830
ooh.
we're alone now.

249
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,860
i must have you.

250
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,830
(laughs)

251
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,360
(moans)

252
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,000
ooh.
i must have you.

253
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,100
laptop, laptop, laptop!

254
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,560
(sighs)

255
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,830
and you know
what else?

256
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,560
i'm still finding sand
everywhere.

257
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,660
i mean, we haven't been
to the beach since argentina.

258
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,330
where is all coming from?

259
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,330
well, maybe you're just
going back

260
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,330
to the person you were
before the trip.

261
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,560
but i don't want to.

262
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,560
i was so happy down there.

263
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,900
no, you know what?

264
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,230
i'm done complaining.

265
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,860
i'm evolving.

266
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,130
just gonna

267
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
go with the flow.

268
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,130
wow.

269
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,930
gael, you're peeing
while i'm in the shower.

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,930
okay.

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
<i>okay, old robin would have been
like, dude, ocupado.</i>

272
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,600
but now, you know what,
i'm cool with it.

273
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,260
pee it up.

274
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,960
in fact,

275
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,200
when you're done, why don't you
come in here and join me?

276
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,700
don't mind if i do, love.

277
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,330
(screams)

278
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,860
gael, there's some weird du...

279
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,200
hello.
hey!

280
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,530
good news!

281
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,060
i made some new traveling
friends today,

282
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,200
and they'll be staying with us,
how do you say...

283
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,860
indefinitely!

284
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,460
all:
g'day!

285
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,460
bp
ooh, here.

286
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,830
will you sign
this thank you note?

287
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,700
wow.

288
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,700
both sides.

289
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,130
you wrote on

290
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,500
both sides of a thank you note
to my third cousin

291
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,960
for a blender that you haven't
even taken out of the box.

292
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,430
wow, that's...

293
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,100
it's a really nice blender.
well, if you love

294
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,500
that blender so much,
why don't you just marry it.

295
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,860
i can't.
i married you.

296
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,500
that's how we go the blender.

297
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,460
what's wrong?

298
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,000
nothing.

299
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,230
nothing's wrong.

300
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,560
what could be wrong?

301
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,730
except that when you die
i'm gonna find out

302
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,830
that your parting words
to comfort me for all eternity

303
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,160
<i>were "cancel vogue."</i>

304
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,430
how can you
open my letter?

305
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,730
that was not a letter.

306
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,160
it was barely even
a text message.

307
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,730
next time you
write something

308
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,330
that short, at least have
the courtesy to make it rhyme.

309
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
marshall, wait.

310
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,430
this was our first fight
as a married couple.

311
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,560
oh, baby.

312
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,630
oh...
oh.

313
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,500
<i>kids, there are a thousand
amazing places you can find</i>

314
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,860
<i>only in new york city.</i>

315
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,200
<i>instead of any of those,</i>

316
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,430
<i>colleen and lindsay
took us here.</i>

317
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,200
<i>colleen:
this is our favorite restaurant</i>

318
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,460
in the city.

319
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,200
yes, i'm sure
this is the best

320
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,460
of their 57 "spudtacular"
east coast locations.

321
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,960
i'm going to run
to the restroom.

322
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,160
i'm gonna go, too.
(growls)

323
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,560
(ted groans, barney laughs)

324
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,930
this is the easiest date ever.

325
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,360
you know
what i'm gonna try next?

326
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,760
a knock, knock joke.

327
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,830
easiest?
somehow we have managed

328
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,900
to find the two lamest
new yorkers of all time.

329
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,730
ted, ted, ted.
dude,
i am looking at you.

330
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,060
what?
right.

331
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,630
stay with me.

332
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,060
we are on the cusp of moving
from out-of-towners

333
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,730
to in-their-pantsers.

334
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,560
ay-o.

335
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,560
all right,
ignatius,

336
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,230
one more hour.
nice.

337
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,100
nice. hey, nice.
hey...

338
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,130
hey, our friends
invited us to a party.

339
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
you guys want
to come along?
knock, knock.

340
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,960
who's there?
yes, we do.

341
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,130
(all laughing)

342
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,130
(cheering on television)
quick announcement.

343
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,660
i am

344
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,660
so glad that you're here,
fellow travelers.

345
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,400
a couple rules--

346
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,900
not even rules.

347
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,130
let's call them guidelines
for harmonious living.

348
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,930
guideline
for harmonious living

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,960
number one--

350
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,730
the kitchen sink is for dishes,
the toilet is for pee-pee.

351
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,960
g.f.h.l.

352
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,400
number two--

353
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,030
marijuana is illegal
in the united states,

354
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
even when baked
into a blueberry muffin

355
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,000
that someone might mistakenly
eat for breakfast

356
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,330
right before they leave for
their job as a tv newscaster.

357
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,530
"this just in:

358
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,700
look at my hand,
how weird is my hand?"

359
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,660
is not an appropriate thing
to say on the air.

360
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,100
and number three, i...

361
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
(all cheering)

362
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,460
and number three is please keep
the noise to a minimum.

363
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,460
i have to take a nap.

364
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,830
i'm still pretty baked.

365
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,660
(gasps)

366
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,330
everything's so bright,
even at night.

367
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,930
no wonder
the city never sleeps.

368
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
(barney and women laughing)

369
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,000
hey, if we're
going north,

370
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,630
why did we cross over the fdr?

371
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,860
we should have taken the hudson.

372
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,900
(scoffing):
now he knows
all the streets.

373
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,030
<i>someone's been watching
too many steinfeld reruns.</i>

374
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,030
(women laughing)

375
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,260
(laughs sarcastically)

376
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,660
where are we even going anyway?

377
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,300
148th and
brook avenue.

378
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,760
a hundred-- in the south bronx
at this time of night?

379
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,860
we're going to get killed.

380
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,330
ted, i think
these local new yorkers

381
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,960
know more about the city
than we do, so relax.

382
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,860
we're in very capable hands.

383
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,360
(siren wails)

384
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,400
there were three of them,
at least two guns--

385
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,700
they took all
oumoney.

386
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,700
well, i only had
traveler's checks.

387
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,960
hey, babe.

388
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,560
i've been thinking
about our fight.

389
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,830
yes?

390
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,160
i'm really, really...

391
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,900
surprised that you haven't
apologized to me yet.

392
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,030
wow, you really want
to open this up again.

393
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,960
oh, i forgot,
you open everything up,

394
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,830
even if you're not supposed to
until i'm dead.

395
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,830
you know that this
is important to me.

396
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,330
why won't you just
write the letter?

397
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
because i can't bear the
thought of not being with you,

398
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,700
not even for long enough
to write you a stupid letter.

399
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,260
really?

400
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,000
yes, really.

401
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,860
plus, i know
as soon as i write it,

402
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,100
you're just going to open
it up and read it again.

403
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,900
lily, i won't,
i promise.

404
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
okay.

405
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,030
i'll write you a letter
for my death folder.

406
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,260
do you mind, um,
maybe slipping

407
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,800
in a little bit of
dirty stuff, too?

408
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,330
i tell you what.

409
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,360
how about i make it
all dirty stuff

410
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,130
and slip in
a little clean stuff?

411
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,500
you're the best.

412
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,200
and maybe a
couple polaroids?

413
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
come on,
let's get out of here.

414
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,560
this night's a disaster.
what?!

415
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,560
this night couldn't
have gone any better.

416
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,730
we just survived
a mugging.

417
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,100
you know what
that means.

418
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,200
"thank god we're alive" sex.

419
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,200
"thank god we're
alive" sex.

420
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,830
it's even better

421
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
than "i can't believe you
just proposed to me" sex,

422
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,830
which i've only had,
like, four or five times.

423
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,430
ted, please, we
are so close.

424
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,130
all right, i'm in.

425
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,260
i've never worked this hard
for anything in my life.

426
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,160
whew!

427
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,560
wow, i think
we all need

428
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,160
to go back to our place
and recover.

429
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,160
yeah.

430
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,760
i just want
to celebrate

431
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,400
the fact that
we survived.

432
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,400
you know?

433
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,560
mm-hmm.

434
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,930
me, too.

435
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,960
so where do
you live?

436
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,560
what, west village?
close.

437
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,430
west orange.

438
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,300
west orange,
new jersey?
yeah.

439
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,330
you guys live in new jersey,
not new york?

440
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,760
theodore.
yep.

441
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,760
new jersey?
teddy.
yeah, but don't worry,

442
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,500
it's pretty much new york.
ted:
oh.

443
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,530
no.

444
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,000
oh, no.

445
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,800
oh, no.
new jersey is not
"pretty much new york."

446
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,100
you are not
"pretty much new yorkers."

447
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,100
and how would
you know?
because i live here.

448
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,600
that's right,
i live here.

449
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,000
yes, we're full of crap.

450
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,860
yes, we pretended
to be from out of town

451
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,530
so we could sleep with you
and leave in the morning.

452
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,300
but you know what's
even worse than that?

453
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,260
saying you're a new yorker
when you're not.

454
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,160
because this is the
greatest city in the world

455
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,130
and you have to earn the right
to call yourself a new yorker.

456
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,800
so why don't
you girls crawl

457
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,130
into the open sewer pipe
you call the holland tunnel

458
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,460
and flush yourselves back
to "pretty much new york"?

459
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,460
because i
will do a lot

460
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,160
to get laid,

461
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,900
but i am not going
to new jersey!

462
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
(huffs)

463
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,730
(in accent):
you're not from missouri?

464
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,630
well, i will be
a monkey's unc...

465
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
ew.
right.

466
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,600
can we get
a ride?

467
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,060
hey, um, sir,

468
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,830
can we get
a ride, too?

469
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,130
newark, born and raised.

470
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,330
(drumming)

471
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
(sighs)

472
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,500
can you please keep it down?

473
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,930
(sighs)

474
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
what happened to you, man?

475
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,960
you said you wouldn't
change, but look at you.

476
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,930
no more tan,
no more beaded braids,

477
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,330
no more lush,

478
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,060
untamed forest
of leg and armpit hair.

479
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,230
you're back
at work.

480
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,500
what gives?

481
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,500
well, i have
to have a job.

482
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,000
"i have to have a job."

483
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,360
god, that's so american.

484
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,500
i'm canadian.
you know that.

485
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,560
what about the important things
like making your own jewelry

486
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,000
and lying
on the beach

487
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,160
and thinking about peace?

488
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,230
god, don't
you care

489
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,660
about thinking about peace?

490
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,530
wow.

491
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,060
i just realized something.

492
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,800
that you've
lost your way.

493
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,800
no,

494
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,200
that you really suck.

495
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,060
you're boring and me

496
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,430
and you're getting sand
everywhere.

497
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,900
seriously, where is
all the sand coming from?

498
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,100
you're not the real me.

499
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,530
all you are is me on vacation

500
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,500
trying to get away
from a break-up.

501
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,700
don't you remember argentina?

502
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,760
don't you want
to go back?

503
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,030
what are you doing?

504
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
shh...

505
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,000
let this happen.

506
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,430
(robin gasps, drumming)

507
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,300
all right, everyone out.

508
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,400
i said everyone out!

509
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,230
(frustrated growl)

510
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,830
(drumming stops,
panicked shouting)

511
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,800
all right, we're leaving,
we're leaving, okay.

512
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,060
michael moore was so right
about americans.

513
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,430
i'm canadian!

514
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,900
robin,

515
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,500
you okay?

516
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
no, i'm not.

517
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,160
listen, gael,

518
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,730
i need to talk to you
about something.

519
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,760
<i>after they broke up,
robin went back to being robin.</i>

520
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,000
(sighs)

521
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,960
welcome home, scherbatsky.

522
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,900
oh, good to be back.

523
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,400
although it's weird.

524
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,900
vacation robin popped into
my dream again last night.

525
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,660
listening.

526
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,260
this time we went all the way.

527
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,660
tell you
one thing.

528
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,630
->1

529
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,130
wñw?
okay, i'm done..

530
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,500
but i really don't want you
reading this unless...

531
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,900
you know, something happens.

532
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,500
can you swear to me
you won't open it?

533
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,330
totally. what does it say?

534
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,800
marshall, i'm serious.

535
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,560
okay.

536
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,730
i promise i won't, i won't
open that until you're dead.

537
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,160
(quietly):
