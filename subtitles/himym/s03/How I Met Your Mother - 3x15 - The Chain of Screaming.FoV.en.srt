1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,580
Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,490
Stella and I had started dating,

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,080
And I'd just gotten a big raise at work,

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,700
So I decided to purchase something I knew

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,300
Would be the envy of all my friends.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,100
A new car!

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,060
Ted, this is new york city-- you're never gonna drive it.

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,230
This is a really, really stupid purchase,

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,700
And I'm sorry, but none of us can support it.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,900
Shotgun for eternity!

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,300
You can't call shotgun for eternity.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,500
I just called it.

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,500
You can't just call things, barney.

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,700
I call that I can call things!

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,700
hey, baby.

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,000
Beer.

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,330
Are you okay?

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,460
Beer.

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,660
Okay, what happened?

20
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,230
They always told me that working at a big law firm

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,760
Was like being at war.

22
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,200
You get out of law school,

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,830
It's like getting out of boot camp.

24
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,930
That first day at work, you're storming the beaches,

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,700
Full of piss and vinegar...

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,400
Dude, we're lawyers now.

27
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,600
Totally.

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,960
We've got briefcases and everything.

29
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,530
Freakin' briefcases.

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,960
You have anything in yours?

31
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,430
Totally empty. you?

32
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,600
Candy bars.

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,230
Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies

34
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,100
And you feel a sense of camaraderie.

35
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,630
But before too long...

36
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,760
Hey, marshall.

37
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,800
...the shells start to fall.

38
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,060
Hello, arthur.

39
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,930
Arthur hobbes is one of the senior partners

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,360
At my firm, and he's... he's my boss.

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,560
He seems like a nice guy,

42
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,730
But he's got a nickname...

43
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,430
Artillery arthur.

44
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
How's your morning going?

45
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,900
It's going fine-- how is yours?

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,430
Not too bad, not too bad.

47
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Hey, is ferguson in yet?

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
He is, he's in... just in his office next door.

49
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,800
That's great-- have a good one, buddy.

50
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,060
You, too.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,800
You never know who's gonna get hit...

52
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,260
Hey, ferguson!

53
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,760
I read your report, and it's complete crap!

54
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,800
No, you know what? that's an insult to crap.

55
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,260
If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that!

56
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,860
Your report is the crap that crap craps!

57
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,500
If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked!

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,700
Shocked!

59
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,400
It was brutal,

60
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,530
But the worst was a few minutes later.

61
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,630
Did you hear that?

62
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,360
Yeah, sorry.

63
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,860
Can you believe he did that

64
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,430
On take your daughter to work day?

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,730
So that brings us to today.

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,200
Oh, no.

67
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,300
A little background.

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
So I'm working on this report

69
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,330
Called "using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,330
"to contest a class certification order

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,830
Based on a lack of commonality, numerosity..."

72
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,130
Dude, you lost us.

73
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,260
Can't you just call it something cool

74
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,460
Like "the ninja report"?

75
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,360
Okay. yeah, fine, whatever.

76
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,530
Um, so I'm supposed

77
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,960
To turn in "the ninja report" yesterday.

78
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,630
-Awesome. -wow. cool.

79
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,160
But I got insanely busy with other stuff,

80
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,260
I didn't get a chance to finish it,

81
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,130
And then this morning...

82
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,630
-Hey, ferguson. -hey, arthur.

83
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,960
How's your day going?

84
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,100
-I gotta go. -great. how is yours?

85
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,800
Great, great-- hey, is marshall in yet?

86
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,500
Oh, thank god.

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,900
Yeah, he's right in there.

88
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,500
Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.

89
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,600
And then...

90
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,100
He screamed at me.

91
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,260
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

92
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,900
What, that's it?

93
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,160
You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?

94
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,660
Barney, I have never been screamed at

95
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,330
Like that in my life.

96
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,530
Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?

97
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,460
I got screamed at three times today.

98
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,800
Once in korean.

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,930
This is corporate america, marshall.

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,730
Screaming is a motivational tool,

101
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,100
Like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment.

102
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,260
It's just good business.

103
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,430
Oh, baby, it's just not fair.

104
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
You've been working so hard.

105
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,830
Late nights, weekends.

106
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,030
I never see you.

107
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,130
We've barely made love in weeks.

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,360
It's bad, guys,mama needs her sugar.

109
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,800
Look, marshall, he screamed at you, you took it.

110
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,430
He probably respects you more for it.

111
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,530
Yeah, about that...

112
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,630
So arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment...

113
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,860
Face turning red,

114
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,500
Vein in his forehead about to burst,

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,130
Spittle flying like shrapnel.

116
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,730
Everyone you work with walking by your office,

117
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,330
Peering in.

118
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,830
And suddenly, I just felt all of it.

119
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,000
All of what?

120
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,430
All of it.

121
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,100
The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment,

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,230
And now I'm working for the bad guys instead.

123
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,030
The fact that I am stuck in this job

124
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,700
Because of a mortgage I can barely afford

125
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,630
On an apartment that is crooked.

126
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,060
The fact that I am a grown man, 

127
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,760
and nobody, not even artillery arthur,

128
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,660
Has the right to talk to me like that!

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,500
I begged my body not to do it.

130
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,730
But it was no use.

131
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,000
I just... I just...

132
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,130
Just because you weren't around for this,

133
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,560
I called shotgun for all eternity in ted's car.

134
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,060


135
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,930


136
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,360
dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.

137
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,860
I don't know what happened.

138
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,800
There's just something about being yelled at like that,

139
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,560
Like I was being scolded by my dad.

140
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,230
Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.

141
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,730
Is "boy" the right word?

142
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,600
I felt absolutely powerless.

143
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,730
Flaccid-- hell, i... I felt castrated.

144
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,300
God, you're hot right now.

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,730
And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk

146
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,100
Into arthur's office and give him the ninja report.

147
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,230
Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.

148
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,760
How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?

149
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,500
Here's what I would do if I were you.

150
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,230
Hi, arthur.

151
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,600
Hello, marshall.

152
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,560
Have you finally finished the ninja report?

153
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,600
Yeah, I got it.

154
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,430
Right here.

155
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,160
I think it's gonna blow you away.

156
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,230
Please, I have a family.

157
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,100
So we good?

158
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
We're so good.

159
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,030
Then why are you still in my office?

160
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,460
Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything

161
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,400
Up in canada, robin,

162
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,660
But here in america, we solve our problems with words.

163
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,500
Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy

164
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,360
With a big eloquent speech defending human dignity.

165
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,000
Like abraham lincoln.

166
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,400
Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big,

167
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,630
Eloquent speech off the top of your head.

168
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,660
Observe.

169
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,960
Arthur?

170
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,030
What do you want, marshall?

171
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,530
Justice, sir.

172
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights,

173
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,800
The most fundamentally paramount of which

174
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,200
Is the right...

175
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,360
Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount.

176
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,100
One means highest, one means lowest.

177
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,200
You are nailing this.

178
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,130
Human beings have rights,

179
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,230
And those rights are, um...

180
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,400
You got me hooked, reel me in.

181
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,160
There are certain justices

182
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,130
That cannot or will not

183
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,500
Be inalienable... as such...

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,960
For the future.

185
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,230
Stuck the landing-- bravo!

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,230
Thank you.

187
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,060
Security's gonna rough you up a bit on t way out.

188
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,130
Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay?

189
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,600
I can't have some big confrontation with arthur.

190
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,260
I need this job, i... I need the money.

191
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,400
Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow,

192
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,500
Tell him off and then quit?

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,930
It's great to fantasize about,

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But nobody ever actually does it.

195
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,560
Gary blauman did it.

196
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,760
Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now.

197
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,500
We were at the morning meeting

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,560
and old blauman was getting reamed out but good.

199
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,930
Pretty much routine

200
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
At the morning meeting, but then,

201
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,530
On this particular day, something amazing happened.

202
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,930
You made yourself look bad,

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,160
You made this company look bad, and quite frankly,

204
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,760
You made our friends, the north koreans, look bad!

205
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,260
And I'll tell you something else,

206
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,100
Blauman, if you think for one moment...

207
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,700
You know what, bilson?

208
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,460
You can kiss my ass.

209
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,700
Oh, snap.

210
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,530
-What? -you heard me.

211
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,030
I don't need to take your crap anymore.

212
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,360
My cousin's website went public today,

213
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,400
And I made a pile of money on the ipo,

214
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,500
so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?

215
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,860
Oh, my god.

216
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,700
He peed on the conference table?

217
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on, come on, come on,

218
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,500
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

219
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,500
Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second

220
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,700
Till I get started?

221
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,560
Come on.

222
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,460
Come on.

223
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,160
Does this help?

224
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,460
W ur eventually, he just gave up and left.

225
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,660
And then his cousin's website tanked.

226
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,960
And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home

227
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,560
And moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.

228
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,600
That's it? that's the end of the story?

229
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,300
No, no, of course not-- he died.

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,030
How does that help me?

231
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,960
How does any of this help me?

232
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,960
Can somebody, for god's sakes,

233
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,260
Please give me one piece of useful advice?

234
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,230
Lily, control your woman.

235
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,260
The lesson of blauman is that when your boss

236
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,830
Screams at you, you never scream back.

237
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
That's why there's a little thing in corporate america

238
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,060
I like to call the chain of screaming.

239
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,800
-Chain of screaming? -yes.

240
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,330
The chain of screaming starts at the top.

241
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,700
Arthur's boss's boss screams at arthur's boss.

242
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,330
Arthur's boss screams at arthur.

243
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Arthur screams at you.

244
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,900
You go home and scream at lily.

245
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,200
Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class.

246
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,230
Then that kid screams at her dad,

247
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,860
Arthur's boss's boss.

248
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,730
And the whole thing starts all over again,

249
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,930
Thus completing the circle of screaming.

250
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,460
I thought it was a chain of screaming.

251
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a circle, ted, I called it a circle.

252
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,160
I don't scream at lily.

253
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,130
And I don't scream at my kids,

254
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,860
None of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.

255
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,700
So it's not a circle.

256
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,860
Fine-- you want it to be a chain of screaming,

257
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,400
It's a chain of screaming.

258
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,930
I came up with the circle idea halfway through,

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,860
Cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor,

260
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,400
But fine, ruin it!

261
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,530
You guys always undermine me

262
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,960
When I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it!

263
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,360
God, I'm surrounded by idiots!

264
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,260
Idiots!

265
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,460
See, doesn't everyone feel better now?

266
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,360
Lily, I need your take on this.

267
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,030
What... what should I do?

268
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,300
Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...

269
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,960
Oh, god.

270
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,700
Kt.is, when dealing with a bully, the most important thing

271
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,030
Is to be constructive and positive.

272
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,860
Hello, arthur.

273
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,060
Hello, marshall.

274
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,630
I have the ninja report right here.

275
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,200
But arthur,

276
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,360
In the future, if you want someone to do their best work,

277
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,800
Try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation,

278
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,800
But through encouragement, inspiration and respect.

279
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,300
Well said, marshall-- I needed to hear that.

280
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,600
By the way,

281
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,460
I saw your wife's picture in your office.

282
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,530
That is one tasty slice.

283
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,860
Oh, you're damn right.

284
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,500
You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?

285
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,200
Oh, yeah.

286
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...

287
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,560
That's it.

288
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,900
...just throw her on the bed...

289
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,530
That's where she belongs.

290
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,060
...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!

291
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,500
It's bad, guys.

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
Mama needs it bad.

293
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,360
You're right, baby, it's about respect.

294
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,730
That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight.

295
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,300
Can you give me that speech again?

296
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,460
I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...

297
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,800
No, the other part, please.

298
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,530
I have the ninja report right here, but...

299
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,530
And it seemed like that was the end of it,

300
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
But it wasn't, because the next night...

301
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,330
Which of these carpets would look better

302
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,860
In the new apartment?

303
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,060
I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft.

304
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,260
It would feel great on your bare feet...

305
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,900
...or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat

306
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,560
Rolling down

307
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,500
Your trembling bosom.

308
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,400
Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?

309
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,500
Shh, don't say my name.

310
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,400
Lily can't know it's me.

311
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,660
Just pretend you're talking to stella.

312
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,830
Be all lovey dovey.

313
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,500
Hey, stella.

314
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,830
Sweetie, how's it going?

315
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,930
Not good, not good at all.

316
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,330
Where are you right now?

317
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,160
Right downstairs, come find me.

318
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,860
Without lily.

319
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,660
Okay, I'll see you soon.

320
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,600
I love you.

321
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,430
I love you, too.

322
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,800
Wow, you two are already saying the "l" word, huh?

323
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,130
Apparently.

324
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,030
You hitting that?

325
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,560
I'm in trouble, ted.

326
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,560
Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.

327
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,060
Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...

328
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,930
I did something stupid-- can we just drive somewhere?

329
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,560
I need to get away-- just drive, man.

330
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,930
Please just drive.

331
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,500
It's just, this is a really good parking spot.

332
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,000
Dude!

333
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,700
Look, just tell me what happened first.

334
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,930
Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That lily told me to give, be firm but respectful?

336
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,560
Well, it didn't totally go that way.

337
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,030
There is a lot of ketchup on that burger.

338
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,360
Sorry-- what happened?

339
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,960
After we all finished talking last night,

340
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,430
I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.

341
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,830
Hey, marshall.

342
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,760
How long have you been sitting there?

343
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,560
If you go in there with lily's kindergarten nonsense,

344
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,200
You're gonna get torn apart.

345
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,230
I'm here to save your life-- you hungry?

346
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
Yeah, I was just about to order.

347
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,430
What do you want?

348
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
A blt and gravy fries.

349
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,600
Okay, friends, what do you like?

350
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,530
A green tea with lemon for me,

351
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,730
And for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.

352
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Very good.

353
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,230
No, I didn't want meatloaf.

354
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,460
Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing.

355
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,060
Arthur screamed at you-- now you have to scream at someone else.

356
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,500
No, I don't.

357
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,500
Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.

358
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,730
Who would I even scream at?

359
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,130
I don't know.

360
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,700
How about somebody who's disappointed you?

361
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,430
Someone who's let you down.

362
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,760
Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf

363
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,530
When you explicitly ordered a blt and gravy fries.

364
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,300
No.

365
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,960
Hey, I was just heading to the bar.

366
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,360
What are you guys doing out here?

367
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,500
Oh, I was just telling ted a story.

368
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,630
Ooh, I like stories.

369
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,400
You want a lick?

370
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,360
-What? -is that ice cream cone big enough?

371
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,630
Uh, it's delicious enough.

372
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,530
Okay, so...

373
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,930
Then I say to barney...

374
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.

375
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,030
Yes, you are.

376
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,560
That waiter is every boss and every bully

377
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,760
Who ever embarrassed or belittled you.

378
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,230
And how dare he deny you

379
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,630
The one thing that you want,

380
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,730
That would make you happy at this moment.

381
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,230
A blt and gravy fries.

382
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,660
One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf.

383
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,500
Enjoy, my friends.

384
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,530
Marshall.

385
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,930
Excuse me?

386
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,160
Yes?

387
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,030
This is not what I ordered.

388
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,130
Yes, it is.

389
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,000
I beg your pardon, sir,

390
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,300
But I ordered a blt and gravy fries,

391
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,830
And as the customer, I'm always right, so...

392
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,460
No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this!

393
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,160
I am at the end of a triple shift-- that's 18 hours!--

394
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,360
And then I have

395
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,400
To take two trains and a bus to astoria

396
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,760
To have my wife scream at me because I'm never home.

397
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,960
No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!

398
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,530
Hey, what are you guys doing out here?

399
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,360
Oh sweet, can I get a toot?

400
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,000
Uh-uh-- against car rules, it's against car rules!

401
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,960
Oh, ted, relax, it's cuban.

402
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,860
People pay to have their car smell like this.

403
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,530
Well, that's just not true.

404
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,930
Oh, marshall, switch seats with me.

405
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,230
I called shotgun for all eternity.

406
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,460
You can't call shotgun for eternity.

407
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,960
Well, that's funny, cause I did!

408
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,300
It's case by case.

409
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,060
Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!

410
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,460
A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?

411
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,260
I don't know, barney, he worked a triple, it just...

412
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,260
If you're not gonna yell at the waiter,

413
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,560
Yell at me.

414
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,230
-What? -yell at me.

415
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,100
I'm not gonna yell at you, barney.

416
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,000
What, you think you're gonna upset me?

417
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Please, give me your best shot.

418
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,900
Okay, fine-- what, you want me to yell at you?

419
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,660
Yeah.

420
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,900
This is me yelling at you, barney.

421
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly

422
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,500
Landing on a leaf about three blocks away.

423
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,600
This is me yelling at you, barney!

424
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,430
Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content.

425
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,960
Make it hurt.

426
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,160
You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!

427
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,830
No, something that's true-- come on.

428
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,260
The man made you cry.

429
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,860
Make me cry.

430
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,030
Your mom's a slut!

431
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,660
Yes.

432
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,460
Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, barney,

433
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,860
But you and your brother clearly have different fathers,

434
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,360
And you know why?

435
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,400
It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!

436
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,530
Keep going.

437
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
I don't care what you say.

438
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,700
Bob barker is not your father!

439
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,160
Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.

440
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,500
Oh my god, barney, I'm so sorry...

441
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,000
No, I'm kidding-- keep going.

442
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,600
Bob barker's not your father!

443
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,030
You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host

444
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,860
Is your real father, and he's not!

445
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,100
You were abandoned, barney!

446
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,060
You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it,

447
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,530
And so now you never allow yourself

448
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
To feel anything, and that's how you survive

449
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,360
In this corporate world, and if I keep heading

450
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,600
Down this path, I'm gonna turn into you!

451
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,600
And I don't want that!

452
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,630
I don't want any of this!

453
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,900
This is not why I became a lawyer.

454
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
This is not the person that I wanted to be.

455
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,060
I quit, arthur!

456
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,360
I quit!

457
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Well, thank you, eriksen, I needed to hear that.

458
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,030
Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally,

459
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,430
It's just that i...

460
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,460
No, no, no, the part where you said, "i quit."

461
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,560
Now we don't have to pay you a severance package.

462
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,360
Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...

464
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,360
-Dude! -dude! -dude!

465
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,600
I'm sorry.

466
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,330
Don't blame this on me, marshall.

467
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,330
I told you to yell at someone beneath you.

468
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,230
The circle of screaming is...

469
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,400
The chain of scr...

470
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,800
Pyramid-- the pyramid of screaming!

471
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,660
The pyramid of screaming.

472
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,930
How am I supposed to tell lily?

473
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
She supported me through three years of law school,

474
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,160
And now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back.

475
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,760
Now we're gonna lose the apartment.

476
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,160
The place where we were gonna raise our children.

477
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,630
How am I supposed to tell the person who I love

478
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,300
More than anything in this world

479
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,000
That I've just thrown away our future?

480
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,200
Everybody out, everybody out of the new car!

481
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,430
Out of the new car!

482
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,430
Ted, screaming never solves anything.

483
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,960
And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.

484
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,900
I'm so sorry.

485
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,360
I just lost it.

486
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,300
But I can fix it.

487
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,560
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there

488
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,700
On my hands and knees and beg for my job back.

489
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,600
No, you're not.

490
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,760
What?

491
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,960
Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment.

492
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,560
And it's definitely not you being miserable

493
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,030
At that horrible job.

494
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm just happy to have my husband back.

495
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,530
We'll figure the rest out.

496
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,800
I love you.

497
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,400
I love you, too.

498
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,860
Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet

499
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,030
Without going bust on the apartment.

500
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,900
You sure about this?

501
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,300
Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?

502
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,130
Ted, I don't think I can accept...

503
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,100
Marshall, don't make me scream at you.

504
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Thanks a lot, buddy.

505
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,930
You guys did it in the car, didn't...

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Oh, yeah!
