1
00:00:00,556 --> 00:00:03,437
<i>It was a quiet November
afternoon in 2007.</i>

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,031
<i>I was working from home,
because, you know, no distractions.</i>

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,474
- This is incredible! I have big news.
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

4
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,996
- I have big news.
- Oh, my God!

5
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:12,933
Okay, my thing's pretty huge.
But fine, you can go first.

6
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:14,749
Okay, I just found out...

7
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:16,834
I found a porno starring Ted Mosby!

8
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,279
What are you...
what are talking about?

9
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:23,260
I'm talking about
Welcome to the Sex Plane,

10
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:27,020
and look who plays
the navigator, Ted Mosby.

11
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,542
It's the same exact spelling
as my name.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,839
Okay, you know, cute coincidence,
Barney. Whatever.

13
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:35,917
I just got off the phone
with the NR...

14
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,153
Oh, my God, this totally explains
the thing at my doctor's the other day.

15
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:40,942
Open wide.

16
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:44,791
I guess you're more used to saying that
than hearing it, huh, Ted Mosby?

17
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:48,951
Who is this guy?

18
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:50,963
And why's my doctor
watching porn?

19
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:53,731
All right, let's meet
your new doppelganger.

20
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,143
Or should I say doppelbanger?

21
00:00:56,366 --> 00:01:00,082
Guys, guys, guys! Can I tell you
my news? It's pretty...

22
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:01,591
This is really bizarre.

23
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:02,891
The only other famous
Mosby I know was

24
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:05,000
a Confederate general
during the Civil War.

25
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:06,250
Probably not the same guy.

26
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:08,033
I got the job
at the NRDC!

27
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:10,032
You got the job! Oh!

28
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:13,612
<i>The NRDC, or National
Resources Defense Council,</i>

29
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>fought to preserve
America's clean water,</i>

30
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:18,021
<i>fresh air and pristine wilderness.</i>

31
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:19,630
<i>It was Marshall's dream job.</i>

32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,562
- Congrats, buddy!
- Thanks.

33
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:23,371
It's kind of weird hugging
with porn on.

34
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:24,542
It really is.

35
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,472
Oh! Hey, hey-o!

36
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,021
New guy entering the cockpit.

37
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:30,353
Could it be the navigator,
Ted Mosby?

38
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,410
Uh... no. No, navigators have
three stripes on their hats.

39
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:35,831
Captains have four.
That guy's a captain.

40
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:39,182
Yeah, and I'm sure complete
accuracy in all those details

41
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,623
was very important
to the directors...

42
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,630
"Dirt and Skank,
The Raunch Brothers."

43
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:50,232
Baby, I have some
exciting news!

44
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:53,872
I hope it's not that you just
won some sort of race here.

45
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:55,622
I got the job
at the NRDC!

46
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,210
And I found a porno
starring Ted Mosby!

47
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,181
Oh my God,
that's amazing!

48
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:01,252
I know, right?

49
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,362
- Oh, congratulations, Marshall!
- Congratulations to us all!

50
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,003
Oh, let's go celebrate!

51
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:09,600
The fact that I found a porno starring
a guy named Ted Mosby... let's do it!

52
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:11,693
Oh, is that him?

53
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:14,403
'Cause that Ted Mosby
really knows what he's doing.

54
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:15,692
No, that's not him.

55
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,331
What do you mean, "that" Ted Mosby
really knows what he's doing.

56
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,781
Oh, no.
No, I meant,

57
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:24,390
that Ted Mosby,
he really knows what he's doing.

58
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,102
Like all Ted Mosbys.

59
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:29,350
Wow, NRDC!
Way to go, Marshall.

60
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,960
But you're still gonna go to your job
interview today, right, baby?

61
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:36,620
<i>Marshall had an interview at a firm
called Nicholson, Hewitt and West.</i>

62
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:39,761
<i>They represented, well, pretty much
everybody Marshall was going to sue</i>

63
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,700
<i>once he started at the NRDC.</i>

64
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,773
I'm not doing that interview.
Those people are evil.

65
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:47,443
Marshall, your dad went through
a lot of trouble to set this up.

66
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:49,673
You can't just pull out
at the last second.

67
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:50,930
Apparently you can.

68
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:55,160
Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat!
Three stripes!

69
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:57,932
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Ted Mosby, porn star.

70
00:02:57,957 --> 00:02:59,703
- Oh.
- Wow.

71
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,212
- Oh!
- Oh.

72
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:04,040
I know what kind of plane this is.
It's a "Boing."

73
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,880
See. This is way better
than Marshall's internship.

74
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:09,492
It's a real job.

75
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,493
Who is this guy?

76
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:12,800
Are we related?

77
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,182
Do, do I look like him?

78
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,993
It's hard to tell.
Go, go like this.

79
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,370
- Oh, yeah, a little bit.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,743
- More around the eyes.
- Oh, I do see that.

82
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:26,750
How I Met Your Mother 3x06
<i>- I'm Not That Guy -</i>

84
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:42,331
And here's your water,
in case you're dehydrated, Ted Mosby.

86
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:45,812
Very funny, Wendy.
Now we know you watch porn.

87
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:49,011
This Ted Mosby must
be getting kind of famous.

88
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,260
You're not wrong.

89
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:53,662
According to the Web site,
of the far superior Ted Mosby...

90
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:58,472
he's been in the business three months,
and he's made 125 movies.

91
00:03:58,578 --> 00:04:01,940
Wow.
That's 42 movies a month.

92
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:04,313
Who is he, Jude Law?

93
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,630
Right? He makes a lot
of movies.

94
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:11,391
I mean, not so much lately,
but maybe, like,

95
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:14,490
two years ago, you couldn't go to
a movie without...

96
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:17,123
Oh, hey, look, check it out.

97
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:20,143
Ted Mosby did an interview
in Adult Video Weekly.

98
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:22,711
Adult Video Weekly?

99
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:23,941
Oh, no.

100
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,351
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm looking for Ted Mosby.

101
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,072
It's Leonard Ross from AVW.

102
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,442
Oh, my God!
AVW?

103
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,562
It's Architecture Vision Weekly!

104
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,721
Wow, I've been reading your
magazine since I was a little kid.

105
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,333
Well, that's a bummer.

106
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:44,052
Anyway, I'm calling to interview
you about your latest project.

107
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:45,941
Well, I don't want to say
it's my project.

108
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,963
I mean, I'll be working with
at least three partners.

109
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:49,990
Oh! Group scene.
Always fun.

110
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:52,440
Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking
forward to it.

111
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:56,573
I mean, I know they're gonna ride me
pretty hard but they're great guys.

112
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:59,773
Guys? Whoa, there's a scoop.

113
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,431
That interview went on
for 20 more minutes.

114
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:05,873
"This project was so demanding,

115
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:09,601
"I can't tell you how many nights
I spent bent over a table."

116
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,670
Oh, hey, baby,
how'd the interview go?

117
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,470
Um, interesting.

118
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:18,370
There I am in the office
of Jefferson Coatsworth,

119
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,251
and I figure I'm not gonna
take this job anyway,

120
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,910
I might as well give this old bastard
a piece of my mind.

121
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:26,082
Jefferson Coatsworth
wasn't what I expected.

122
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:27,691
Marshall,

123
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:29,571
Jeff Coatsworth.

124
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:32,003
Hello.

125
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:35,283
Dude, I am so, so psyched
that you're here.

126
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:36,882
Can I beer ya?

127
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,141
<i>Marshall was thrown.</i>

128
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,721
<i>This guy seemed nice.</i>

129
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:40,750
<i>Of course, he wasn't.</i>

130
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:41,713
- Sous-titre non traduit -

131
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,152
Go-go to hell!

132
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:45,431
I'd do it again!

133
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,932
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

134
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:49,871
Marshall,

135
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:53,452
why do you want to work
at Nicholson, Hewitt & West?

136
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,960
Right, um, okay, Jeff, I've actually
given this a lot of thought...

137
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,003
I'm sorry. Stop.

138
00:05:58,106 --> 00:05:59,760
I can't do this
with a straight face.

139
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:02,340
You don't want
to work here.

140
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:05,312
You're only here 'cause your dad
went to high school with Joe Hewitt.

141
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:09,530
Fact is, you just got
a sweet job at the NRDC.

142
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:11,202
And it's awome.

143
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:13,910
Man, I could
have gone the non-profit route.

144
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,092
I didn't.

145
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,999
And it eats me up inside
every day.

146
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:19,697
I hate myself.

147
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,063
I hate myself.

148
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:25,833
Oh, he's good.

149
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:27,951
Classic seduction technique.

150
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:30,601
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I use it all the time.

151
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:33,730
First I buy her,
and by her I mean you, a drink.

152
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:35,801
Now, I'm the guy
who gets her what she wants.

153
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,241
Then I pretend to care about whatever
idiotic thing she cares about.

154
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,581
For you, that would be
the environment.

155
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:44,090
Now, I'm the great
guy who shares her interests.

156
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:46,642
And before you know it,
you're naked in my apartment

157
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:49,840
shouting, "Oh, oh,
Bar-r-r-ne-e-ey!"

158
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:51,903
And by you, I mean her.

159
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,550
He is not trying
to seduce me.

160
00:06:54,618 --> 00:06:56,152
He didn't even
offer me the job.

161
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,333
That comes later.
At dinner.

162
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,731
He did invite you to dinner,
didn't he?

163
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:05,653
Let me buy you dinner, tomorrow night,
as a thank you ?

164
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:08,100
Okay? You'll tell me all
about the NRDC,

165
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:10,711
and we'll charge it all to
one of my evil clients.

166
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:13,072
- I, you know, I don't know...
- Marshall,

167
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,883
you know what Kobe beef is?

168
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,673
The most expensive beef
in the world.

169
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,661
The place I'm taking
you has Kobe lobster.

170
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:27,553
That is lobster fed
with Kobe beef.

171
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,012
Oh, my God, he's
trying to seduce me.

172
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:33,851
So are you gonna go
to dinner with him?

173
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:37,872
No. No way.
I promised myself to the NRDC.

174
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,401
I'm not that kind of lawyer.

175
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,023
Oh, you should go. I mean,
you're not gonna take the job,

176
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,500
but you might as well get
a great meal out of the deal.

177
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:45,831
Don't wait up.

178
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:48,311
Guys, guys, guys,
check this out.

179
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:52,031
Ted Mosby porn star's bio
says his hometown is your hometown.

180
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,231
Shaker Heights, Ohio.

181
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,100
<i>What?</i>

182
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:57,070
Okay, this is getting creepy.
Who, who is this guy?

183
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:58,140
I gotta find him.

184
00:07:58,236 --> 00:08:01,082
Well, it's your lucky day. He's gonna be
signing autographs tomorrow night

185
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:04,241
in Manhattan at something called
the Adult Video Expo.

186
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:08,142
Wait. Are you telling me that they
actually have conventions for porn?

187
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,692
Affirmative.
Or to put it another way...

188
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:13,111
God bless America.

189
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,520
You can really taste the beef
in that lobster.

190
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:19,540
Right.

191
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:21,403
Listen,

192
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:25,493
I know we're only here to screw over my
client, who quite frankly deserves it...

193
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:30,473
but I gotta be able to tell the guys
upstairs I gave you the spiel, okay?

194
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:31,650
So, first up,

195
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,320
- starting salary.
- Okay.

196
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,160
Here we go.

197
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:40,200
This is the big number that's supposed
to impress me and... Wow.

198
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:43,321
That is a... Big number.

199
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,972
There's also a signing bonus,

200
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:49,281
use of a company car,
expense account, blah blah blah.

201
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:52,882
Hey, by the way, turn around
and wave to Patrick Swayze. Hey.

202
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,392
I'm going to, uh,
try to remain cool.

203
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,582
But you know Patrick Swayze?!

204
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:01,733
He's a client.

205
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:04,532
Who do you think bought us
this wine. Crazy Swayze.

206
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:05,931
Cheers, buddy.

207
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,443
Okay. No. Jeff, this is all
very impressive,

208
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,141
- but I just don't think that...
- Listen, I know, I know.

209
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,520
You're not gonna be tempted by
big numbers and fancy perks.

210
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:18,403
You're gonna
do the noble thing,

211
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:21,011
take the low-paying job
at the NRDC,

212
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:22,750
live off your family money.

213
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:24,091
Family money?

214
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:26,260
You do have family money,
don't you?

215
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,211
No, um, not that I know of.

216
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:32,583
I do have an uncle who owns a,
a pretty successful bait shop.

217
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:37,392
NRDC.
No family money.

218
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:41,442
Oh. So you don't plan on
having kids?

219
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,741
Actually, I,
I want to have four kids.

220
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:45,702
Well...

221
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,912
New York public schools make
a lot of parents nervous,

222
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:51,141
but the kids who walk out,

223
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,841
walk out proud.

224
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,843
<i>It was turning into
a tough decision.</i>

225
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,902
<i>Now, kids, when I'm facing
a tough decision</i>

226
00:09:57,945 --> 00:09:59,750
<i>I like to get out
the old yellow legal pad</i>

227
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,511
<i>make a list of pros and cons.</i>

228
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,002
<i>Marshall new all the cons,</i>

229
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,861
<i>but there was one thing
he didn't know,</i>

230
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,943
<i>a big item in the pros column.</i>

231
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:09,250
- Lily, you're a kindergarten teacher.
- Yeah.

232
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:12,521
<i>'Cause Robin was about to ask
Lily the one question...</i>

233
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,482
An-And you make a kindergarten
teacher's salary, right?

234
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:16,382
Yeah.

235
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,393
<i>...that Lily had been dreading
for years.</i>

236
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:20,950
How do you afford all
of these expensive clothes?

237
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:23,770
I shop the sales.

238
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,253
They were in the closet
when we moved in.

239
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,312
I steal.
I'm a criminal.

240
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:32,171
I once shot a man
just to watch him die.

241
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,362
- Lily?
- Okay.

242
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,331
<i>That's when Lily showed Robin
her box of shame.</i>

243
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,531
Lily, this is nuts.

244
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,982
- How many credit cards do you have?
- I don't know.

245
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:48,063
- How much do you owe?
- I don't know!

246
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:54,951
Wow. I can't believe this many
people love porn this much,

247
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:58,663
including that guy who works
in human resources at my firm. Hi.

248
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:02,611
Let's just wave at each other awkwardly.
That'll make it better.

249
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:06,722
Dude, come on, let's just find
Bizarro me and get out of here.

250
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:08,871
Oh, oh, I get it.

251
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:12,930
Ted Mosby, non-porn star, thinks
this is all crude and disgusting.

252
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:16,633
You know who else was considered
crude and disgusting? Shakespeare.

253
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:21,390
But his themes, love, lust,
forbidden desire, were universal,

254
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:24,200
which is why his work has
stood the test of time.

255
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,702
And so will all this.

256
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,932
400 years from now,

257
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:31,100
some high school drama class
will be doing a plucky,

258
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:35,080
spirited production
of Beef Party VII.

259
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:38,781
Oh, my God, Lily,
that is a lot of debt.

260
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:41,232
How did you get yourself
into this situation?

261
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:42,902
I don't know what it is.

262
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,210
When I feel down
about something, I shop.

263
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:48,321
Ma'am, is everything okay?

264
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:51,112
No, I just had a huge fight
with my mother.

265
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:52,881
She doesn't understand me
at all.

266
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:58,652
I swore that teaching would be a way
to support my painting career,

267
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,743
but I never paint anymore.

268
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:05,240
I just got
a huge credit card bill.

269
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,523
- Does Marshall know?
- No.

270
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:11,493
But you guys are the couple
who tell each other everything.

271
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:14,451
And for God's sakes, Lily,
you text him while he's on the can.

272
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:17,241
Well, I just want him
to know I'm rooting for him.

273
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,821
Wait, okay,
this all makes sense.

274
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,062
So when you said...

275
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:24,801
But you're still going to go to your
job interview today, right, baby?

276
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,521
<i>And then...</i>

277
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:28,270
Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not
gonna to take the job,

278
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:30,590
but you might as well get
a great meal out of the deal.

279
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:33,860
You were pushing him into taking that
high-paying corporate job.

280
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:37,623
I know. It's terrible that I was
trying to get him to do that.

281
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,583
Terrible? He has to take it.

282
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:42,083
I mean, how else are you going
to pay off all that debt?

283
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:45,763
Lily, you have to tell him about this
before he turns down that job.

284
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:49,213
You're right. I feel awful.

285
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,971
- You know, there's a sale...
- We're not going shopping.

286
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,842
There he is.
Come on, let's go.

287
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:04,862
Why do I get so nervous
around celebrities?

288
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:09,791
Hi, Ted Mosby.
I'm Ted Mosby.

289
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,362
- Ted Mosby, it's you.
- Have we met?

290
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:15,130
Mr. Mosby, it is an
honor to meet you, sir.

291
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:17,300
Starney Binson.
Barney Stinson.

292
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:18,050
Damn it.

293
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:19,732
We have met.

294
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,551
My real name is Steve Biel.

295
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:23,502
When I was in fourth grade,
you were in ninth,

296
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,402
and, and one day
I was out behind the school

297
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:28,251
and a bunch of seventh graders
were just beating the crap out of me.

298
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,222
Oh, yeah, I remember.
That was you?

299
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:30,990
Yeah,

300
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,421
but you pulled them off me.

301
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,983
You told them to go pick
on someone their own size.

302
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:39,392
I vowed right then that
when I made something of myself,

303
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,372
I would honor you somehow.

304
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:44,111
So you took my name
and starred in...

305
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:46,043
Welcome To The Sex Truck?

306
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:47,842
Yeah.

307
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:52,382
Yeah, listen, Ted,
you got to stop using my name.

308
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,972
I, I'm trying to make a career
as an architect.

309
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,393
Architect, huh?

310
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:59,271
You mean like a sex architect?

311
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:00,420
What?

312
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:04,011
Yeah, you know, you're on to something.
That would make a great title of a film.

313
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:06,862
Ted Mosby, Sex Architect.

314
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:11,733
You know, I'm actually looking for a new
project to shoot next Friday afternoon.

315
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:15,902
Yeah, listen, isn't, isn't there some
other way you could honor me?

316
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,610
With all due respect.

317
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,550
Wait, you're not mad, are you?

318
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:21,843
Oh, man, I knew it.

319
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:25,153
My father said,
"Just plant a tree in Israel."

320
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:26,963
I'm such an idiot.

321
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:29,320
I guess I thought
you'd be psyched.

322
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:32,050
I am.

323
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:35,173
I am, it's just
I feel a little guilty because

324
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,311
I'm not the one who saved
you that day.

325
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:40,461
The guy who actually
saved you was...

326
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,341
named...

327
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:46,063
Lance Hardwood.

328
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,532
Lance Hardwood, yeah.

329
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:49,833
Really?

330
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,923
You know, you might not know this,
but,

331
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:55,481
in my business,
that's kind of a killer name.

332
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,960
Yeah, I guess,
I guess it is.

333
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:00,373
I can see the poster now.

334
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:03,171
Lance Hardwood, Sex Architect.

335
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:05,091
Starring... Ted Mosby.

336
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,782
I love it.

337
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,972
<i>Marshall and Jeff stayed
pretty late at the restaurant.</i>

338
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:13,951
<i>They stayed so late that Marshall
crashed on Jeff's couch,</i>

339
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:14,891
<i>and the next day,</i>

340
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:19,051
<i>Marshall took part in a Sunday morning
tradition as old as the city itself:</i>

341
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,821
<i>the Walk of Shame,</i>

342
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,222
<i>the long journey home after doing
something you regret the night before.</i>

343
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,182
I'll take the job.

344
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:27,611
That's awesome!

345
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,230
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

346
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:31,180
Great time last night.

347
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:32,820
I'll call you later.

348
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,103
He's not going
to call you.

349
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:39,991
- Hey.
- Hey.

350
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:42,111
Did you get my message?
I just...

351
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,042
- I crashed uptown.
- Yeah, yeah. Listen,

352
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,020
I have, uh,
something to tell you.

353
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:49,543
Uh, I have something
I need to tell you also.

354
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,543
Mine's pretty huge.

355
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:53,201
You go first.

356
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,593
Well...

357
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:56,112
I took the job.

358
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:59,591
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I was drunk,

359
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:03,971
and it was a haze of cigars
and scotch and Swayze,

360
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:05,741
and they offered me, like,

361
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:08,913
like, like, like,
a lot of money.

362
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, Marshall.

363
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:14,291
How much money?

364
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,160
Here.

365
00:16:20,037 --> 00:16:22,901
Whee!

366
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,112
Yeah!

367
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,493
It's completely despicable.
I know,

368
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:33,751
I know, I sold out for a huge pile
of disgusting money,

369
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:38,733
disgusting money that could
help our future family

370
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,053
have some financial security
and could help pay for law school.

371
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:43,422
Law school.

372
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:46,193
Law school that I went to
to help protect the environment,

373
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:48,373
not help destroy it.
And for what?

374
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:51,060
For, for... a lot of money.

375
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:57,942
Okay, you've got
to stop screaming.

376
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:00,730
Listen, Marshall, you know what I like
to do in situations like this?

377
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:04,600
Ted, if you say make a list of pros
and cons, I'm going to smack you.

378
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,272
I wasn't going to say that.

379
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:10,802
Okay, two beers, and Ted, here's that
yellow legal pad you asked for.

380
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:13,233
Yellow legal pad?
I ordered fries.

381
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:16,100
Maybe you should use this
to write down people's orders.

382
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:21,341
Guys, I, I don't know what to do.

383
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:25,291
Take the money. Money is good,
money is happiness.

384
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:29,721
If I work there, I'll be representing
the most evil corporations in the world.

385
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:31,920
Kind of sounds
like a pro and con list to me.

386
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:35,892
Lily, you have to tell him.
You can help him make this decision.

387
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,290
Oh, I think he's doing fine
on his own.

388
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,890
All right.

389
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:49,952
Marshall,

390
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:54,603
I have something to say, and it's gonna
help you make your decision.

391
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:58,011
Oh, of course, you know
my heart better than I do.

392
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:02,800
You know what's best for me and for us.
Please, please tell me what to do.

393
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:10,603
I think you should take
the job at the NRDC.

394
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:13,662
Of course I should,
of course I should.

395
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:17,593
Guys, I'm going to save
the planet Earth.

396
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,521
I got to go call Jeff.

397
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,950
What is the matter with you?

398
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:28,903
I can't ask him to make himself
miserable because of a mistake I made.

399
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:31,372
It's my problem;
I'll figure it out.

400
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:33,373
That's really sweet.

401
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:36,633
- Are those new earrings?
- What are you, my mom?

402
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,711
- Jeff, hey, um, it's Marshall.
- <i>Hey, Marshall.</i>

403
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:44,331
I have something
that I need to tell you.

404
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,992
I feel really weird
about doing this over the phone.

405
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:47,880
<i>Then don't.</i>

406
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,530
Before you say anything,

407
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,322
come take a ride
in this awesome limo with me.

408
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,320
Where are we going?

409
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:57,982
Tuckahoe Funland.

410
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,163
I'm sorry. It sounded like you said
Tuckahoe Funland,

411
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,280
the magic factory
where dreams are made.

412
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:05,811
Get in.

413
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:15,190
- Man, I-I love this place.
- Me, too, buddy.

414
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:17,763
So what did you
want to tell me?

415
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,100
I can't work for you.

416
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:22,662
I know, dude.

417
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:24,091
It's fine.

418
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,271
Marshall Eriksen wants to
preserve the environment,

419
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,400
so that our children can enjoy it
as we have. I get it.

420
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,522
Good. Thank you.

421
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:38,251
I look down... and see children
enjoying this place.

422
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,652
Yeah, because somebody fought
to preserve it.

423
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:44,520
If they ever shut this place down,
it would be a tragedy.

424
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:48,270
Well, the good news is,
that'll never happen.

425
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:50,073
You won't let it.

426
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:52,693
Because when you work for us,

427
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:54,270
your only client...

428
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,130
will be this place...

429
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:58,371
Tuckahoe Funland.

430
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:03,752
I'm taking the job.

431
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:04,722
- Hey!
- All right.

432
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,561
And the best part is

433
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,941
I'm not even going to be representing
some sort of evil corporation.

434
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:09,612
I will be representing

435
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:11,251
Tuckahoe Funland,

436
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,000
the least evil place
in the world.

437
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:14,563
<i>Or so Marshall thought.</i>

438
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,331

00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:22,302
Great news, great news.

442
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,131
Oh, I'd better check on him.

Terrific.

480
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,922
You'll notice I'm
in the credits.

481
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,470
I did some location scouting.

482
00:20:57,438 --> 00:21:00,893
<i>Here are the plans for the new
International Sex Building.</i>

483
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:04,860
Wow... that really looks
like our apartment.

484
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:05,770
It is.

485
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:07,870
Oh, I should return these.

486
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,330
<i>Oh, Sex Architect,
you've done it again.</i>

487
