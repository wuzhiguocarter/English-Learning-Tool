00:00:00,769 --> 00:00:04,470
<i>Kids, the early bloom of a romance
is a wonderful thing.</i>

2
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:06,919
<i>You meet someone,
you have a connection,</i>

3
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:09,744
<i>and that person becomes
sheer perfection in your eyes.</i>

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:11,962
<i>You just can't find
anything wrong with them.</i>

5
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:14,090
<i>And you can't wait to tell
the world about it.</i>

6
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,302
She convinced you
to go jogging?

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,083
Wow, you really want to get
in this girl's pants.

8
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:20,891
I'm telling you,
you guys are gonna love her.

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,768
Lily, she knows all about art.

10
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,470
Marshall, she's open to the
existence of UFOs.

11
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:28,872
Barney, she's hot.
Robin, she's not hotter than you.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,319
- Like her already.
- How not hotter?

13
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:34,147
<i>So we all went out to dinner,</i>

14
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:37,652
<i>and I couldn't wait to see if my friends
were as crazy about Cathy as I was.</i>

15
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:39,873
So, what's everyone getting?

16
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:41,453
Well, I can't decide.

17
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:43,783
Which sounds better,
chicken or lasagna?

18
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,050
Lasagna. Just get the lasagna!

19
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,652
Oh. You guys just
got a new place.

20
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,150
How many bedrooms is it?

21
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,741
Two. It's two bedrooms!

22
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,442
Okay! Let's hear it.

23
00:00:58,677 --> 00:00:59,923
What's wrong with Cathy?

24
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:01,490
Are you kidding me, Ted?

25
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:04,480
- She's got a...
- Wait! You don't notice it?

26
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,540
Notice what?

27
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,271
Oh, he doesn't see it.

28
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,961
If we point it out,
we're gonna ruin her for him.

29
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:12,120
As his friends, we'll just
keep him in the dark.

30
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:13,253
You're right.

31
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:14,820
She's great, man.

32
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,563
She's a keeper. Just...

33
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:20,360
keep her somewhere else.

34
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:23,543
How I Met Your Mother 3x08
<i>- Spoiler Alert -</i>

35
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:37,620
Marshall, what is everyone's
problem with Cathy?

36
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:40,080
Oh, she's a total nightmare, Ted,
but can we talk about this later?

37
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:42,951
I'm a minute away from finding out
if I'm gonna be a lawyer or not.

38
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,662
<i>You see, kids,
during the summer,</i>

39
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,531
<i>Marshall had taken
the New York Bar exam.</i>

40
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:49,713
<i>His years of school,
his countless hours of study,</i>

42
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,823
<i>had finally culminated in this
grueling, two-day ordeal.</i>

42
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:54,992
And... begin.

46
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:00,012
<i>The pressure of it
was enormous.</i>

47
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,521
<i>Every year, people taking
the bar simply cracked.</i>

48
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,482
<i>But Marshall
had made it through.</i>

49
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:14,690
And...

50
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:15,791
time.

51
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:25,361
- Time's up.
- Right.

52
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:26,613
Time.

53
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:27,983
- Sir.
- I know.

54
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:29,700
- Your time is...
- I know it is.

55
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:31,053
Give me...!

56
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:35,431
<i>Now, months later,
the results of that exam</i>

57
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:37,903
<i>were scheduled
to post online at 10:00,</i>

58
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,543
<i>and it was 9:59.</i>

59
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:41,330
Damn, they're not up yet.

60
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:43,893
Oh, don't worry, baby.
I'm sure you rocked it.

61
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:45,840
I mean, how many people
fail the bar?

62
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:46,722
Half.

63
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:49,813
Oh, my God, half?
Only half the people pass?

64
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,590
I mean, half the people pass.
That's fantastic.

65
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:53,862
Go, Marshall.

66
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,191
Oh, hey, can I jump on there?
I want to show you something awesome.

67
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:58,893
What? No, no.
Bar results. My future.

68
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,730
Trust me. You need
to see this.

69
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:03,093
What is so important
that I need to see it right now?

70
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:06,020
It's a video of a dog
pooping on a baby.

71
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,590
How do I need to see that?

72
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,791
Why would I want to see that?

73
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:16,782
In what possible way could
subjecting my eyes and my brain

74
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,330
to something that disgusting
enrich my life?

75
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:23,150
It's a dog pooping on a baby.

76
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,993
Get away from my computer.

77
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,790
Okay, just do a quick Google
search for "caca spaniel."

78
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:31,462
- The results are in.
- Whoo. What's it say?

79
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:33,190
"Input password."

80
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:35,122
Input the password !

81
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,092
It's okay. They assigned it
to me when I took the test.

82
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,872
It's gotta be around here
somewhere.

83
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,543
Here. Here-here-here-here.

84
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:43,960
Jelly beans, fluffernutter,
Gummi Bears, ginger snaps...

85
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,381
This is a grocery list

86
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:48,372
For who? A witch building
a house in the forest?

87
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:50,463
Sugar helps me study.

88
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,980
This is like the shopping
a ten-year-old does

89
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:54,972
when his parents leave him alone
for the weekend.

90
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,891
What parent leaves a ten-
year-old alone for the weekend?

91
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,753
And your mom was perfect.

92
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:02,420
I can't find my password!

93
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,442
Okay, just... can't you let 'em know
that you lost it

94
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:05,770
and they'll e-mail it
to you or something?

95
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:08,413
No! They won't let me do that. I'm gonna
have to wait till the results come

96
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,371
in the regular mail. That could be
weeks from now, if ever!

97
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,040
Our mail carrier hates me

98
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:14,782
ever since I asked her
when the baby was due.

99
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:17,961
- She wasn't pregnant?
- No, he was not.

100
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:21,183
Okay, well, that's a drag,
but the results will come eventually.

101
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:23,260
Just try to keep it off
your mind until then.

102
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,320
Hey, Brad.

103
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:29,633
Oh, congratulations, man.

104
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:33,173
I'm, uh... I'm not sure yet.
I...

105
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:34,741
lost my password.

106
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:36,630
That's great, Cara.

107
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,642
I don't know yet.
I lost my password.

108
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,951
I don't know how I lost it!

109
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,593
This stuff happens!

110
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:48,621
You're one to talk.
You misplace stuff all the time.

111
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,332
I'm sorry. I'm sure the nurses are
stealing your medicine, Grandma.

112
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,541
Love you, too.

113
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,233
If I have to wait six weeks
to find out if I passed,

114
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:01,762
I'm gonna have
a heart attack.

115
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:04,973
Based on that grocery list, I'd
say diabetes is a bigger worry.

116
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:06,883
You know what?
Laugh all you want.

117
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:08,973
This affects my whole
future, all right?

118
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:12,411
Okay. I probably shouldn't
be telling you this.

119
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:14,411
I definitely shouldn't
be telling you this,

120
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,903
but there is a way I can
help you with your problem.

121
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:18,332
How?

122
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,380
I know a guy at work.

123
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,352
He can get access to software
designed to penetrate firewalls

124
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:26,663
and retrieve passwords
through secure servers.

125
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,740
I can get into any computer.

126
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:30,013
So what do we do?

127
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:32,931
Like, arrange a secret meeting
in a darkened parking structure?

128
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:35,202
- No.
- Can we?

129
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:36,992
- No.
- I have a trench coat.

130
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,382
Dude, be cool.

131
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:44,670
So, I just got off the phone
with Cathy.

132
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,901
God, you guys are so right.
I totally hear it now.

133
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,042
See it now?

134
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:52,491
Smell it?

135
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:54,031
What is it?!

136
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:55,732
I left the table
for two minutes.

137
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,160
What could she have possibly done
in that time that was so horrible?

138
00:05:58,256 --> 00:05:59,032
Was it...

139
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,881
I'll be back in one second.

140
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,182
One time, in the tenth grade,
as a joke,

141
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:09,080
I told everyone that my English teacher
had sex with me.

142
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:11,993
He's still in jail.

143
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:13,940
Or maybe...

144
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:16,042
I'll be back in a second.

145
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,609
So I volunteer at the pound.

146
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:22,267
- Oh, isn't that nice?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:26,082
You can't imagine the rush you get
from killing an unwanted puppy.

148
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:29,492
I make bracelets
out of the collars.

149
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:31,883
Or...

150
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,353
I'll be back in one second.

151
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,570
I bet he's going to the urinal.

152
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,183
Yeah. I remember when
I had a penis.

153
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:46,363
It wasn't anything she did
while you were in the bathroom.

154
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,422
It's just the way she is.

155
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:51,863
I don't get it. If it's so obvious
and you guys all see it,

156
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,943
how come I don't?

157
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:54,712
'Cause we're not trying
to have sex with her.

158
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:58,230
Brother, you're driving the "I want
to have sex with her" truck,

159
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:00,250
and it's got a huge blind spot.

160
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,601
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it really?

161
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,931
Ted, let me tell you a little story

162
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:08,351
about a young lady I wanted
to have sex with...

163
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:09,581
Lucilia.

164
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,372
On a white sand beach
in Rio de Janeiro,

165
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:16,421
we made love
for ten straight hours.

166
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,483
When we were done,

167
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:19,851
she applauded

168
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:23,242
and told me
I was far, far better

169
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:26,463
than the best lover
she could possibly imagine,

170
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:29,871
and that I had restored
her faith in God.

171
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,150
What does this
have to do with Cathy?

172
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:35,372
Who's Cathy?

173
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:39,600
Just tell me what the hell
is wrong with her already.

174
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,372
- Okay. You want to know?
- Yes.

175
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,073
You want to shatter this beautiful
illusion you've created for yourself?

176
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,052
Fine. Here it is.

177
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,770
Cathy talks...

178
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:52,400
a lot.

179
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:56,690
Oh, come on.
That's not true.

180
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:01,721
Ted. Really, really think about
that dinner we all just had together.

181
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,061
<i>And I did.</i>

182
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,521
So, what's
everyone getting?

183
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,340
Well, I can't decide.

184
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:09,653
Which sounds better,
chicken or lasagna?

185
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:12,010
I like chicken. I like lasagna.
I like them both,

186
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,730
but I really like pork.
A lot of people don't eat pork,

187
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:16,883
and maybe it's because
of that movie Babe or something.

188
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:20,031
But that was funny. He was a talking pig
and he was like "Bah, Ram, Ewe!"

189
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:22,393
What-what if there was a sorority,
"Bah, Ram, Ewe?"

190
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:25,932
I'd totally rush it.
...And so I named him Dr. Seuss!

191
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,222
- Lorax is a funny word.
- Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!

192
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,771
Oh, you guys just got a new place.

193
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,183
How many bedrooms is it?

194
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:37,021
I would love
to have an extra bedroom,

195
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,442
because I would put
a Stairmaster in there.

196
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,480
But you guys should get
a convertible sofa.

197
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:43,520
Or a futon. Futons are great. Or what
about one of those Murphy beds?

198
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:45,921
Who invented the Murphy bed?
Was it a guy named Murphy?

199
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,471
Oh, my God. Do you guys remember
that show Murphy Brown?

200
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:51,702
That was a funny show.
She had a new assistant every episode.

201
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,540
...and it was like half an hour
before I realized

202
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:56,983
he wasn't even on the phone anymore!
Isn't that hysterical?

203
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,220
Two! It's two bedrooms!

204
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:02,403
Hey, do you guys
like cannolis?

205
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:04,221
Because I know this place
and it's in the South Bronx

206
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:07,221
and you wouldn't expect it, but
they have the best cannolis in town.

207
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:11,290
<i>And just like that,
the illusion was shattered.</i>

208
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,732
She just never
shuts up, does she?

209
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:19,002
She didn't stop
to swallow her food.

210
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,510
I was scared for her.
I didn't want her to choke.

211
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,072
At first.

212
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:30,373
<i>So kids, this girls I was dating
would not stop talking.</i>

213
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:32,270
<i>Can you imagine
how awful that is?</i>

214
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:38,891
Do you own a wok?

215
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,770
'Cause that's really how...

216
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:43,942
Don't you just love autumn?

217
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:48,041
Today I'm dressed for...
Oh, my God. The sweetest thing.

218
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:51,211
And I know this great place
where we can go.

219
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,320
They have guys and girls clothes.
We could both shop at the same time.

220
00:09:54,357 --> 00:09:56,431
And a lot of times boyfriends
and girlfriends...

221
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:59,573
Hey! Why are you running so fast?

222
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:04,213
Well, thank you, pal.
You and your little friends,

223
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,461
you just had to tell me.

224
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:07,761
You just had to give in
to my incessant begging.

225
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,493
You said
that you wanted to know.

226
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:12,960
- I didn't want to know!
- You said you wanted to know!

227
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:16,113
Well, I didn't know
I didn't want to know! You knew.

228
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:20,072
And you know me. And you should
have known I didn't want to know!

229
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:21,713
You know?

230
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:25,982
I'm sorry we told you. I'm surprised she
didn't tell you herself at some point.

231
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:28,680
There's only a finite combination
of words in the English language.

232
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:31,493
Well, you could have let me
enjoy it a little longer.

233
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,911
She's got all these other
great qualities. She's smart.

234
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,613
She's caring.
She loves animals...

235
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,600
You know how to teach her a lesson?
Buy her a parrot.

236
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:42,860
Oh, come on. I'm sorry
that we told you, okay?

237
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,811
It's part of being
in a relationship.

238
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,243
Eventually, you get used
to these annoying little things

239
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:48,973
that bug you at first.

240
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:50,223
Yeah, I guess.

241
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:52,702
I mean, you got used
to Lily's loud chewing, right?

242
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,781
Lily doesn't chew loudly.

243
00:10:56,935 --> 00:11:00,362
Dude...
Come on. This isn't news.

244
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,163
Why do you think I call her
"Chewbacca"?

245
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,332
I assumed because she's loyal,
wears shiny belts

246
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:07,072
and I resemble
a young Harrison Ford.

247
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:10,252
Think about it.

248
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,992
Oh, man, honestly, dude,

249
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:42,033
that's the meanest thing
you've ever done to me.

250
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,623
I really thought you knew.

251
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,503
We had ribs the other night.
It sounded like Jurassic Park.

252
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:50,372
Ha-ha-ha. You know what?
It doesn't matter.

253
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,333
<i>But it did.</i>

254
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,773
Say, what's in that cereal

255
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:16,803
besides dry twigs
and small animal bones?

256
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,371
What's that supposed to mean?

257
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:21,940
Lily, I love you,
but honest to God,

258
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:25,711
when you eat, it sounds like a garbage
disposal full of drywall screws.

259
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,050
What's the matter with you?

260
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,583
We've been together ten years,
and you're saying this now?

261
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:34,143
Well, I never noticed it before
until...

262
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,640
Until what?

263
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,353
Can you believe Ted?
What a lame thing to say,

264
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:39,851
that I'm a loud chewer.

265
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:44,600
Yeah, that's crazy.

266
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:48,942
Maybe enough with the pretzels.

267
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:52,551
Oh, my God, do I really chew
that loudly?

268
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:55,643
No, no, no.

269
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,641
Okay, now that
you pointed it out,

270
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:03,862
maybe it does sound slightly like someone
put a screwdriver in a pencil sharpener,

271
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,832
but in a cute way.

272
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:09,660
This is all Ted's fault.
Oh, like he's so perfect,

273
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:11,050
Mr. Corrector.

274
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:12,172
What do you mean?

275
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, come on. You dated
the guy for a year

276
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:18,700
and you never noticed that most of
what Ted says is correcting you.

277
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,310
Hey, can you hand me a Kleenex?

278
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:26,400
Actually, Kleenex is a brand.
This is a facial tissue.

279
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,932
Oh, my God, is Frankenstein
gonna kill that little girl?

280
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,390
Uh, Dr. Frankenstein
isn't in this scene.

281
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:35,442
That's Frankenstein's monster.

282
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:41,020
That literally blew my mind.

283
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,763
Figuratively.

284
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:47,891
Oh, my God, you're right.

285
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,563
- That is so annoying.
- Isn't it?

286
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:54,351
Where are those pretzels from,
Ace Hardware?

287
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:05,050
Hey, man, you like kettle corn? I'm
trying to get rid of anything crunchy.

288
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,792
Are the blinds closed?

289
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:09,260
- I don't know.
- Are the blinds closed?!

290
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,193
Yes, the blinds are closed.

291
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,102
Good, I didn't think I was followed,
but you can never be too sure.

292
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,202
Now double-lock the door
and stay away from the windows.

293
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:20,572
Is there a reason that
you're acting like this?

294
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:22,973
We're about to find out
if you're a lawyer.

295
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:26,913
Now, in good conscience, I have to
inform you that using this software

296
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:28,971
is in violation
of the Patriot Act,

297
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,713
the Strategic Defense Initiative,

298
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:35,011
and the National Security Act
of 1948, which created the CIA.

299
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,812
So I hope you passed
the bar because

300
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:39,673
if we use this software,

301
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:42,500
the night janitor Gligor
who I fooled into putting

302
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,703
fingerprints on my computer,
is going to need a good lawyer.

303
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:48,800
Are you certain you want
to go through with this?

304
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:52,000
I have to know,
yes, yes.

305
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,001
Very good.

306
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:56,753
First, we go to the New York
State Bar Web site.

307
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,673
We disable the firewall,

308
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:01,160
then the recursive algorithm
grabs your password,

309
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:06,360
and as the application erases itself
leaving no trace we were here ever...

310
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,700
you ready
to see your future, bro?

311
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:10,880
Yes.

312
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,182
It's a dog pooping on a baby.

313
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:24,173
Right!
Isn't that awesome?

314
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:27,263
So you went through all this just
to get me to look at your stupid video?

315
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,341
Yeah, it was worth it.

316
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:30,802
Barney, Barney, that was
the biggest test of my life.

317
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:33,180
I'm incredibly stressed out
right now, and I...

318
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:36,881
Okay, that's pretty funny.

319
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:40,803
You got to see this.

320
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,702
Yeah, I have to...

321
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,110
She'll call back
when she realizes I'm gone.

322
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,891
Probably in about 45 minutes.

323
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:52,762
- Hey.
- Hi.

324
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,430
- You guys want a drink?
- I'll just have a water.

325
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:57,611
Mm, technically,
water is a drink.

326
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:00,580
Really, Professor?
You drink it?

327
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:02,020
Is that how water works?

328
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,941
Because I was just gonna smear it
on my skin and hope that I absorbed it.

329
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:07,820
Or you could, you know,
pour it over your shirt.

330
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,171
What's with you?

331
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,971
You're always correcting people.

332
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:15,102
- You totally do that!
- That's absolutely right.

333
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:18,592
Right? I never noticed it before,
and now it's literally driving me crazy.

334
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:19,670
Figuratively.

335
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:23,773
Okay, maybe so, but it's no worse
than you using the word "literally"

336
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,410
in every other sentence.

337
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:29,043
Don't they teach
vocabulary in Canada?

338
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,992
They literally don't.
They literally don't.

339
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,202
Shut up, Marshall.

340
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:37,053
That's nothing compared to your thing
of singing what you do all the time.

341
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:37,833
What?

342
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:42,022
<i>Paying my bills
using return address labels</i>

343
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:46,610
<i>From a charity
that I haven't given money to</i>

344
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:52,740
<i>Writing a check
'cause now I feel guilty</i>

345
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:56,382
<i>The Salivation Army
does not fight fair.</i>

346
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:03,010
<i>Heading down to
the basement today</i>

347
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:06,803
<i>With my laundry
and a roll of quarters</i>

348
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:14,931
<i>But I'm back too soon 'cause I left
the detergent and the fabric softener</i>

349
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:21,462
- Those lines are so sloppy.
- Oh, come on!

350
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:23,523
What about you, "Barney"?

351
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:26,050
Okay, you...

352
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:29,070
- always...
- Interesting, interesting,

353
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,491
everyone has annoying habits
but me.

354
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,311
Oh, got it.

355
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:37,793
Okay, you sometimes talk
in a weird high-pitched voice.

356
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:42,720
And you're constantly using
lame catchphrases.

357
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:46,300
And sometimes you space out

358
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,410
and don't even pay attention
to what we're talking about.

359
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:51,842
I'm sorry. What?

360
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:55,010
Oh, see?
You can't think of anything

361
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:57,161
'Cause I'm awesome!

362
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:58,573
All three right there.

363
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:00,671
Well, technically, "awesome"
wouldn't be a catchphrase.

364
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:02,361
If anything,
it's more of a catchword.

365
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:04,771
I literally want
to rip your head off.

366
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:07,000
You mean "figuratively"!

367
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:10,001
No, I literally mean "literally."

368
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,762
Literally, literally, literally.

369
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:16,020
Oh, my God, Lily, what
are you eating, gravel?

370
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:19,153
Oh, I know, right? It sounds like
cufflinks going up a vacuum cleaner.

371
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,880
Well, why don't
you sing about it?

372
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:23,642
Because I don't sing
about everything I do.

373
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:28,071
No, no, sometimes you just sing nonsense
sentences like a stroke victim,

374
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,341
and what's worse,
they're catchy.

375
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:35,240
<i>Apple, orchard, banana,
cat dance, 8663</i>

376
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,002
See? We know that one because
once you sang that for, like,

377
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:40,653
three hours.
What the hell is that?

378
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:43,321
That's my password.

379
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:47,281
AOBCD8663.

380
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:54,503
- Oh, Marshall!
- Awesome!

381
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:56,613
There's another one.
It's called "Golden Reliever,"

382
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,233
- where this dog...
- Yeah, we can guess.

383
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,850
All right, guys,
guys, guys.

384
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:05,911
I'm a lawyer.

385
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,673
<i>And just like that
we stopped fighting and</i>

386
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:12,540
<i>celebrated Marshall's success.</i>

387
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:15,001
<i>You see, when someone's bad
habits are pointed out to you,</i>

388
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:15,952
<i>it's hard to ignore them.</i>

389
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:18,661
<i>I'm a lawyer now
'cause I passed the bar</i>

390
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:21,253
<i>I'm imposing Marshall law
on this champagne.</i>

391
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:25,341
Oh my God, are you literally
on cloud nine right now?

392
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:27,871
Baby, you never have
to take the bar again.

393
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:31,970
Actually, if he practices law
in another state, he will have to,

394
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,013
but New York, man!
It's a great state to practice law in!

395
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,702
Lawsuit up!

396
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:40,573
<i>But if you love them enough,</i>

397
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:43,060
<i>those bad habits
are easy to forget.</i>

398
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,130
<i>Three years later,
I ran in to Cathy</i>

399
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,231
and she was doing well.

400
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:51,953
Ted?!
Oh, my God,

401
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,891
I haven't seen you in so long!
How long has it been?

402
00:19:53,937 --> 00:19:55,830
Three years? No, four.
No, three, 'cause I went blonde

403
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,580
and then I went back
'cause I was having too much fun.

404
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,431
It's true what they say:
blondes have more fun.

405
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,120
Oh, my God, I'm being so rude.

406
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:04,061
Ted, this is my fiancé.
Yes, I'm engaged.

407
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:05,232
Ted, this is Daniel.

408
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,230
Daniel... this is Ted.

409
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:14,221
Great, great, nice to meet you.

410
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:16,770
You guys seem perfect
for each other.

411
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,950
Oh, my God. I know, right? Totally,
it was like love at first sight.

412
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,911
Hey, we should go out sometime.
Are you seeing anyone?

413
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:23,031
Because we could double-date.
That... ? No, it's not weird.

414
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:24,921
We can go have brunch out the street.
I know this place.

415
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,202
Do you guys like popovers?

416
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:27,100
- Because I love popovers.
- She sur can talk a lot, huh?

417
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:27,902
They're like croissants,

418
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:29,632
but they're a little bit less flaky
and they're kind of round.

419
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:31,431
Hey, they have strawberry jam.
