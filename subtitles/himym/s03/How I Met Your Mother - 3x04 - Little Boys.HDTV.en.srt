1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:02,781
<i>It was Saturday night
in New York City,</i>

2
00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:05,238
<i>and the young metropolit
was out on the town,</i>

3
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:08,699
<i>living the kind of crazy lifestyle
you can only find in the Big Apple.</i>

4
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:10,497
- 97.
- 97.

5
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:11,830
- 98.
- 98.

6
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:13,856
- 99.
- 99.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,896
100!

8
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:20,208
A hundred? We only got to 82
on our honeymoon.

9
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:23,799
So, Robin?
I've got a guy for you.

10
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:26,990
- He's cute. He's funny. He's smart.
- What's his "but"?

11
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:28,102
What do you mean?

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,329
When someone wants
to set you up,

13
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,327
they always tell you
their good qualities first, but

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,192
then they leave out
their huge flaw.

15
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:35,600
She's totally hot
and really fun.

16
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:37,212
<i>But she has a dead tooth.</i>

17
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:40,541
She's super-hot,
and she's so successful.

18
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:43,720
<i>But she has a pug that
she pushes around in a stroller.</i>

19
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:46,840
She's so cute,
and she's so smart.

20
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:49,661
<i>But her last boyfriend had
to get a restraining order against her,</i>

21
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:52,981
<i>and then his cat and new vacuum
cleaner both went missing.</i>

22
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:54,690
Wow! Set it up!

23
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:57,061
I'm still convinced she
killed my turtle.

24
00:00:57,427 --> 00:01:00,063
Hey, you know what?
Not every setup has a "but."

25
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:02,762
What about, um, Jamie, that girl
that Lily set you up with?

26
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:03,682
She was really nice.

27
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,590
If memory serves me,
she had a huge "but."

28
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:06,832
Her huge butt.

29
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,872
Nailed it!

30
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,782
Well, there's nothing wrong
with this guy.

31
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:13,071
He's really nice,
and he's really cute...

32
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,080
But?

33
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:15,892
Fine.

34
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:17,113
But he has a kid.

35
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:20,731
Aha! There it is! Robin's not
going out with a guy with a kid.

36
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,192
But the guy is really great,
and his kid's sweet.

37
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:25,830
- He's in my class.
- It doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.

38
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,833
I don't hate kids.

39
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:30,870
You told me even when you
were a kid, you hated kids.

40
00:01:31,305 --> 00:01:33,941
Robin, will you watch
cartoons with me?

41
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:35,592
I go to school all week.

42
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,772
Can't I just have
five minutes to myself

43
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,220
to read Highlights and
drink my juice?

44
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:45,350
Okay, yes, kids are not my favorite
thing in the world,

45
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:47,732
- but I like them.
- Well, you don't want to have them.

46
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,143
I like sports cars,

47
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:51,620
but it doesn't mean I want to
push a Ferrari through my vagina.

48
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,062
Shotgun.

49
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:56,940
You can't blame us for thinking
that the kid would be a problem.

50
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,712
I mean, if we were friends
with Garfield,

51
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:00,413
we wouldn't set him up
on a date with Mondays.

52
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:03,760
You know what?
The kid is not a problem.

53
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:04,612
I want to meet this guy.

54
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:06,861
- Okay. That's awesome!
- Yeah.

55
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:09,123
Hey, what's my "but"?

56
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:12,310
You know, I'm a...
I'm really nice, but...

57
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:14,130
<i>But she's afraid of commitment.</i>

58
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,700
<i>But she's a gun nut.</i>

59
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,262
<i>But she's Canadian.</i>

60
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,133
<i>But she didn't like Field of Dreams.</i>

61
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,512
- I can't think of...
- You don't have a "but."

62
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:26,071
How I Met Your Mother 3x04
<i>- Little Boys -</i>

63
00:02:38,346 --> 00:02:39,873
Okay. I've got it.

64
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,731
Here. Put on this eye patch.

65
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,403
- Why?
- The ultimate ice-breaker.

66
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,891
A bunch of cobras got loose
in Central Park.

67
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,250
You and I are jogging...

68
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:53,942
training for the Death Valley Iron Man.

69
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,760
No big deal.
We do it every year.

70
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:57,150
Suddenly,

72
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:59,162
we see these snake bastards

74
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:03,762
sneaking towards a little baby.
Not on our watch.

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,852
You grab the kid, I strangle
six cobras with my bare hands.

77
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:13,003
Women of New York,
one at a time, please.

78
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,243
So what are the eye patches for?

79
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:19,102
- We got bit.
- On the eye?

80
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:20,603
Yes.

81
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,543
Both of us?

82
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:25,820
They're different eyes.
I don't know see why this bumps you!

83
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,580
Patch up!

84
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,341
<i>So Robin went on a date
with George,</i>

85
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,710
<i>the guy with the kid,
and afterwards...</i>

86
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,430
Okay, here's the thing.

87
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:37,900
George is a great guy.
We had a wonderful date.

88
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:39,343
But?

89
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,571
Great. I can't wait
to meet him.

90
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:43,322
"Can't wait to meet him"?

91
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,221
Why did I say that?
I don't want to meet his kid.

92
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:48,472
Well, you knew you'd meet him
sooner or later.

93
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,480
Oh. I was just hoping
for later, like

94
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,740
in 20 years when I'm a cougar
and he's as hot as his dad.

95
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,463
Robin, what's the big deal?
He's just a kid.

96
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,241
He's not going to bite.

97
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:00,770
He may bite.
We're working on biting.

98
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,200
Why is this kid around anyway?
Shouldn't he be with his mom?

99
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,010
I mean, what kind of lawyer
does this guy have

100
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:09,061
if he has to take care
of the kid all the time?

101
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,643
A good one.
He won full custody.

102
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:14,012
He won?! He won?

103
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,153
Oh, God, getting the kid
is winning, isn't it?

104
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,002
Don't tell anyone I said that.

105
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm going out
buying eye patches.

106
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:26,261
What are you doing
to help score chicks?

107
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay, I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

108
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:30,180
People with real game don't
need eye patches.

109
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:35,083
Theodore. No, no, no.

110
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:38,453
You can't spell "game"
without "me",

111
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,023
and "me" has the best game.

112
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:44,312
Yeah, well, I got so much game,
I'm Cornish game hen.

113
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,410
Oh, yeah? I'm the New York State
gaming commissioner.

114
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,122
Well, I'm The Game.
Well-crafted,

115
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,041
keep-you-guessing thriller starring
Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.

116
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:58,161
You're here
and not in stall two.

117
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,203
Yeah. So?

118
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,430
I may have made some

119
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:06,663
wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments
to a gentleman wearing your shoes.

120
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:09,860
- Okay, Marshall?
- Yes.

121
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,363
Which one of us has more game?

122
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:15,192
Neither of you guys has
any game, right?

123
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:17,301
Or else you'd be married
like me.

124
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:19,041
What?

125
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,791
If dating is the game,
then marriage is winning the game.

126
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:25,622
Yeah. If you're playing
in the women's league.

127
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:28,630
You're joking.
I have mad game, brah.

128
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:34,153
One: we agreed not
to ever say "brah" anymore.

129
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:37,310
It was a good week,
we had a lot of fun, but it's over.

130
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:40,950
Two: you've been with Lily
for 11 years.

131
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:43,013
Your idea of good game is

132
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:47,901
slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing
two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.

133
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,582
Yeah, I hate to say it, buddy, but, uh,
you're kind of irrelevant.

134
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:52,223
What? I am not irrelevant.

135
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,943
I know tons of stuff.
I can help you guys.

136
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,960
I don't want to be left out.

137
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,233
Ted, you do not have
more game than me.

138
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,103
By sheer numbers alone, I win.
Come on, dude. You've seen my list.

139
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:04,423
You guys want to hear one of my lines?

140
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:08,003
First of all, I did not ask to see
that list, and I am still horrified.

141
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,503
And true game
is about quality, not quantity,

142
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:14,402
and a quality girl would pick me
over you any day.

143
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,670
Are you a model?

144
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,672
That one's good because
it's flattering. To the girl.

145
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,329
Ted, I challenge you
to a picking up girls Olympiad.

146
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,107
- Fine.
- There will be 26 events

147
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,191
spread out over 11 weeks.

148
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:33,380
We will travel to a neutral city
where a panel of international judges...

149
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:35,412
Or we could just choose a girl,
and the first one to seal the deal wins?

150
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:36,561
That's good, too.

151
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,892
How about her?

152
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:41,240
You're on.

153
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:45,161
Before we start, why don't we jot down
a few basic ground rules?

154
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:48,211
Okay, great. Rule #1:
no eye patches or props of any...

155
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:54,090
One time, I was with this girl,
and I tried that model line,

156
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,692
and I totally got
some over-the-shirt boob action

157
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,721
in the "Just Say No" assembly.

158
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:01,040
Man, just stop.
You're bumming everybody out.

159
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:09,523
Rule #2: this bet is
for one million dollars.

160
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:11,682
- I win.
- How?

161
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:15,251
Oh, I slept with her.
About a year ago. I just forgot.

162
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:18,793
Oh, well, that doesn't count.
The bet started the moment we shook.

163
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:21,620
But I can't sleep
with her again. She hates me.

164
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:25,141
Oh. Interesting. Look who just took
a commanding lead.

165
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,111
Now with you out of the picture,
I can take my sweet time.

166
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,001
- Ted, she's leaving.
- Get out of my way.

167
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,681
By the look of those shoes,
here comes your bathroom buddy.

168
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,442
Look who's got game.

169
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,522
So, you're a big kids person, huh?

170
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,400
Only the biggest ever.

171
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,873
I think kids are so great,

172
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:54,130
especially, um, the little ones.

173
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:58,303
You know, uh... pudgy,
can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.

174
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,050
- You mean babies?
- Yeah, I like that kind.

175
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,122
- Well, Doug's almost six, so...
- Oh, six is great.

176
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,382
Oh, you are going to love six.

177
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:09,700
Six is when they, uh,
they really start to, um...

178
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:12,670
I hate kids.

179
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:13,953
Excuse me. What?

180
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:17,882
I mean, I don't hate kids.
I'm-I'm just not a kid person.

181
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:20,362
I mean, yeah, it's cute that
their shoes are real little,

182
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:22,253
but beyond that, what's the draw?

183
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:25,251
You must think I'm nuts.

184
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:28,232
What? No, no, no. I...
So you don't like kids, so what?

185
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:31,150
And I'm not looking
for a mother for Doug.

186
00:08:31,318 --> 00:08:33,770
Uh, why don't we just hold off
on you meeting him?

187
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,130
Yeah. Let's take things slow.

188
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,712
<i>And kids, that's exactly
what she did.</i>

189
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:43,011
<i>Then, on a totally different day that
was definitely not the next morning,</i>

190
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:46,000
<i>Aunt Robin had to face
her worst fear.</i>

191
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,212
- Hey, what's up?
- It's here, Lily.

192
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,140
It's looking at me.

193
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:56,431
The kid. What do I do?

194
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:58,591
Just talk to him.
You can do this, Robin.

195
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:00,231
Who are you?

196
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:03,640
- Um, I'm Robin.
- That's a bird's name.

197
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:06,952
Ah, no, it's not.
It's actually a type of bird.

198
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:10,542
My friend Patrick has a parakeet
named Robin, so there.

199
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:13,593
- Do you want to talk in Morse code?
- Dude, I'm-I'm just reading my paper,

200
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,900
- so...
- Beep.

201
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:16,611
Beep-beep-beep.

202
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:21,640
Beep. Beep. Beep...!

203
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,462
I'm starving.
Will you make me cereal?

204
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:26,453
Sure.

205
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:28,832
What are you doing?
You're supposed to pour the milk first.

206
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,982
What?! No, you pour the cereal first so
you know how much milk you need.

207
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,711
It tastes better milk first!

208
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:36,192
It all tastes the same
once it's in the bowl.

209
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,633
Why are you wearing
my dad's pants?

210
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,072
Milk first it is.

211
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:43,410
What are you reading?

212
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:45,531
The business section.

213
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:48,913
The Fed's going to lower rates again
to bail out these sub-prime lenders.

214
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,430
Bunch of idiots.

215
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:53,263
Ms. Aldrin says it's not nice
to call people names.

216
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:56,570
Well, maybe if they weren't such idiot
I wouldn't have to call them that.

217
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,030
That's what I said.

218
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:00,212
You're pretty cool.

219
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:02,343
You, too.

220
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,970
<i>Meanwhile, Stacey and I
had started dating.</i>

221
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:08,330
<i>Oh, Stacey was the girl
from the bar.</i>

222
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,750
<i>Anyway, I was close to winning the bet
when something unexpected happened.</i>

223
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,891
<i>I started to really like her.</i>

224
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,723
Well, have fun in yoga.

225
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,553
She's strengthening her core.

226
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:18,943
I think that's going
to be good.

227
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:20,760
Yeah? All right.

228
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:23,622
After a while, crocodile.

229
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:25,622
You see this?

230
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,162
Game face.

231
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:28,371
Whatever, Ted.

232
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:32,832
Oh. Get this. She plays bass
in a reggae band.

233
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:36,231
They're having a show this Friday.
How cool is that?

234
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:37,810
Oh, does she know that one song?

235
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,671
Mm-mm, chaka, mm-mm, chaka.

236
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:42,221
What's that song called?

237
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,691
Oh, right.
It's called every reggae song.

238
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,980
- I am not irrelevant.
- What?

239
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:48,403
I ran the numbers.

240
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,083
If Lily and I have sex
twice a week,

241
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:53,490
which let's be honest,
we all know is being conservative,

242
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:55,981
and we've been together
for ten years,

243
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:59,502
plus 17 more times
on the honeymoon,

244
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:02,911
minus the two-week drought when
I said the checker at the grocery store

245
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:04,342
reminded me of a young Lily,

246
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:07,103
then we have had sex
a total of...

247
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,203
- wait for it...
- Nice.

248
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:12,741
1,053-1/2 times.

249
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:14,663
My mom called once.

250
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,372
But that's more times
than Barney has ever had sex,

251
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:20,220
and to your point, Ted,
Lily is a quality girl.

252
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,472
I win. Lawyered.

253
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:26,660
Doesn't count.

254
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,483
- It totally counts.
- You're right. It does count.

255
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:33,112
It counts as one.
You've had sex once. How was it?

256
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,202
I still matter.

257
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,182
Okay, Ted, go win the bet.

258
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:44,853
You have my blessing.
She's a wonderful girl.

259
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:46,163
I should know.

260
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:49,803
Oh, okay.
Ok, I see what you're doing.

261
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,263
We've never shared a woman,
have we, Ted? Isn't that funny?

262
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,653
You're with her now.
I was with her a year ago.

263
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:59,251
You figure, for her,
that's like 200 showers ago.

264
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:02,241
You've got to ask yourself, Ted,
"Is 200 enough?"

265
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:04,483
You know what?

266
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:05,581
I don't mind.

267
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:07,532
No, of course you don't mind.

268
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:10,160
Just like the second guy to climb
Mount Everest didn't mind

269
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:14,152
getting all the way to the top only
to find Sir Edmund Hillary's flagpole

270
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,323
thrust into its supple peak.

271
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:19,923
No, I'm sure when you're with her,
I'll be the furthest thing from your mind.

272
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:22,702
Kissing what I've already kissed,

273
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,223
nuzzling what I've already nuzzled,

274
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,740
going... (blubbering) on what
I've already gone (blubbering) on.

275
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:35,223
Barney, I'm not afraid
of catching your cooties, 'kay?

276
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:37,692
Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties?

277
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,861
Okay, well, then I guess
you'd have no problem

278
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:42,592
- having a sip of my gin and tonic.
- Fine.

279
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,510
And I only stirred that
with my pinky.

280
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:54,921
Guess who loves Robin.

281
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:58,311
Kids. Kids love Robin.

282
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,441
Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.

283
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:04,710
Really, that's great!
You and George, all thanks to me.

284
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,823
Yeah, I'm going to have
to break up with him.

285
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:09,743
- What?
- Well, it's just...

286
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:12,021
it's getting a little bit
too serious with the kid.

287
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,752
You know, it's just not
what I'm looking for.

288
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:17,963
So better I break it off now
before he gets too attached.

289
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:19,651
What?

290
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:22,111
I hate to tell you, but...

291
00:13:22,965 --> 00:13:24,490
too late.

292
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,103
He drew it in class today.

293
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,071
Oh, crap.

294
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,022
There's no way
that's a picture of me.

295
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:41,681
That woman has on hoop earrings.
I don't even own hoop earrings.

296
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:44,753
I have one pair and they're gold.
Those are fruit loops.

297
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:46,823
You are so in denial right now

298
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,660
and you're doing what you always
do in relationships:

299
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:52,503
the second you get close to a guy,
you want to bail.

300
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:55,900
Okay, granted, he's six,
but the point stands.

301
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:58,771
Well, we'll ask the guys.

302
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:00,442
They'll tell you that's not me.

303
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:01,810
That's totally you.

304
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,812
Wh... you guys are crazy.

305
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,343
Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?

306
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,281
- It's not me.
- You're joking, right?

307
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:09,743
- It's not me!
- "My new mommy."

308
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:11,383
Kind of has a nice ring to it.

309
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,491
Hey, now that you're a mom,
are you going to start wearing

310
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,113
those totally awesome jeans
that go right up to your boobs?

311
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,523
Do you guys really
think this is me?

312
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:20,033
Honey, it's you.

313
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:21,790
And if you're going
to break up with George,

314
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,751
you have to break up
with his kid, too.

315
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:26,442
- Really?
- Yeah, you can't just abandon him.

316
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,901
You have to talk to him.

317
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:31,172
Come on, Robin, you know
it's the right thing to do.

318
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:32,663
Oh, man.

319
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,402
Doug was right: you are
a pain in the ass.

320
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,742
So I had a really
nice time tonight.

321
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,700
- Me, too.
- Yeah?

322
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:49,121
Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want,
but I was here first.

323
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:01,733
From this spot, I also launched
an expedition

324
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:04,820
to those two large ridges
down there.

325
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:18,260
Ted?

326
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,672
Something wrong?

327
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:27,032
- Hey, Doug.
- Are you here to see my dad?

328
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,420
He's taking a shower.

329
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,750
Actually, I came to see you.

330
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:32,940
I wrote a poem.
Do you want to hear it?

331
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:34,293
Sure. Why not?

332
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:36,473
"To my new mommy.

333
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:39,883
"You are pretty.

334
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:41,182
"You are nice.

335
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:44,961
- And you smell like daisies."
- Aw, that is so sweet.

336
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,520
Even though it doesn't rhyme.

337
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:49,840
Look, uh, Doug.

338
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,421
There's no good way
to say this, uh...

339
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:54,550
<i>Aunt Robin didn't know
what to say.</i>

340
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,031
<i>This kid has never been
dumped before.</i>

341
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:58,871
<i>But then she realized...</i>

342
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,320
<i>this kid had never been
dumped before.</i>

343
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,681
<i>She could use every cliché
in the book.</i>

344
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:05,152
We need to talk.

345
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,331
I just think, um, we both could use
some space right now.

346
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:11,320
It's not you. It's me.

347
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:14,412
Look, I know this hurts,
but you deserve someone better.

348
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:18,010
I'm just really trying to focus
on my career right now.

349
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:19,690
You know?

350
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:21,522
I just hope we can
still be friends.

351
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,171
Hi.

352
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:31,422
I'm Brooke. I'm here
for my date with George.

353
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:34,052
You must be the babysitter.

354
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:42,850
I had so much coffee earlier. I need
to run to the loo, but hey, Dougie.

355
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,242
What the hell was that?

356
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,803
That was my new mom.

357
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:54,541
So... this picture is not of me?

358
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,780
- Why would I draw a picture of you?
- Wha...?

359
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,353
How many dates has she been on
with your dad?

360
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,082
Two.

361
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:03,762
I've been on, like, five and
you like her better?

362
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:05,442
We just really connected.

363
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:06,943
And what about me?

364
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,720
You think I just go around pouring
cereal for every boy in town?

365
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:13,400
Why are you getting
so upset, Roberta?

366
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,950
Robin. My name is Robin.

367
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:18,092
Like the bird, remember?

368
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,380
Whatever.

369
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,612
So that's it, huh?

370
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:26,412
- Look, you're great, but...
- Yeah.

371
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,342
There's always a "but."

372
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:32,110
Well, I couldn't do it.
I broke up with her.

373
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:35,041
Thanks a lot, by the way.
A beautiful, sexy girl

374
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,392
and all I could think about
was you being there first.

375
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,191
You were stuck in my head
like a Chumbawamba song.

376
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,921
Which Chumbawamba song?

377
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:47,911
Well, what an interesting
turn of events.

378
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:50,230
It looks like I'm going to win.

379
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,941
What do you mean "win"?
You couldn't even talk to her.

380
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,590
You tried and you got slapped.

381
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,730
That's what you think happened.

382
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:58,291
Okay, great, rule #1:
no eye patches or props of any ki...

383
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,842
Here's the deal: my friend just got
dumped, so he's a little shy,

384
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,431
but he'd love to buy you
a drink and get to know you.

385
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,461
The problem is, he thinks a pretty girl
like you won't go for a guy like him.

386
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:07,230
So would you slap me across the face so he can
see you're not into guys who'd feed you lines?

387
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:08,703
What do you say? For my friend?

388
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,233
You are so sweet.

389
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,693
So now, whatever nice things
Ted does for her, in her mind,

390
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,632
I'm the guy who's even
nicer than him.

391
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,001
So you never slept with her?

392
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,651
Not even at all.

393
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:22,001
Wow, that's good.

394
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:23,021
It gets better.

395
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:24,480
Remember Ted's phone conversation?

396
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,090
Well, have fun in yoga.

397
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:26,832
Well...

398
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:30,291
- I am...
- Sorry.

399
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:31,830
Stacey, right?

400
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:34,981
Yeah... oh, you're Ted's friend
from the bar, right?

401
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,762
Wait, don't tell me you go
to yoga here, too.

402
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:37,743
I do.

403
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,200
She plays bass in a reggae band.

404
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,382
...and then I'm going to head
out to a reggae concert.

405
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,653
I'm a huge fan of reggae.

406
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:45,731
Oh, my gosh!

407
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:47,263
I play in a reggae band.

408
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:48,523
No way.

409
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,010
I wonder why Ted didn't
tell me about that.

410
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,410
Like I said,
I'm a huge reggae fan.

411
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:54,722
Well... I should go inside.

412
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:56,572
After a while, crocodile.

413
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,213
- See you later, allig...
- See you later, allig...

414
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,353
We are two peas.

415
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:03,062
Wow, well, take care.

416
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:05,122
Um, namaste.

417
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:13,203
You are a sociopath.

418
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:14,660
And that was my yoga mat.

419
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,192
So now with Ted out of the picture,
I'm going to swoop in

420
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,320
and win the whole thing.

421
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:20,022
Why?

422
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:23,402
"Parce que j'ai le jeu, mes chiennes".

423
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:24,580
Translation:

424
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:27,373
"'Cause I got game, bitches."

425
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:29,763
No. No, this doesn't prove
anything because...

426
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:30,691
Hold on a second.

427
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:32,400
It's Stacey.

428
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:34,622
Hey, Stace?

429
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:36,313
What happened?

430
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:38,983
He did not!

431
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,140
Stay there. I'll be right over.

432
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:47,590
I should've just worn that
stupid eye patch.

433
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,271
Oh, I can't believe you got
dumped by a six-year-old.

434
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,151
Whatever. He's a stupid-head.

435
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:57,261
I'm just...
I'm done with kids.

436
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:00,161
<i>Of course, Robin eventually
made her peace with kids.</i>

437
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,393
<i>And as you guys know,</i>

438
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:04,041
<i>she went on to appear in some
very important works of art:</i>

439
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:05,261
<i>yours.</i>

440
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:23,722
Hey.

441
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,232
You know, I really appreciate

442
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:28,402
how cool you've been
about us taking things slow.

443
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:30,762
Since Ted, you know, I...

444
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:33,073
I don't really want
to get physical too fast.

445
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:36,090
That's what makes you
so special, baby.

446
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:39,380
Anyway, I am so psyched
to be playing Sunsplash tomorrow.

447
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:41,682
We go on sometime
between 11:00 and 6:00,

448
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:44,562
so you probably want to get there
before 9:00 just to be safe.

449
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:48,200
Oh... and it's gonna be muddy.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
