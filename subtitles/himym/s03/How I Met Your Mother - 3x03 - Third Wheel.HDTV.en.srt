1
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:02,902
<i>Kids, I know you think
that you've heard every story</i>

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:04,760
<i>from back before I met
your mother,</i>

3
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,499
<i>but there are
some stories you tell</i>

4
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,295
<i>and some stories you don't.</i>

5
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,675
Oh, my God!...
Oh, my God...

6
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:13,029
- Use your words, Ted.
- Okay.

7
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,328
Barney,

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,270
- I'm about to go for the belt.
- The belt?

9
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:18,846
- The belt.
- But that's impossible.

10
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:20,490
You were up here
less than half an hour ago.

11
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,482
Yes! Advantage Ericksen.

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,919
Don't get cocky.

13
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:29,587
- Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.
- Fortnight.

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,371
British words are so cool.

15
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,073
Plus, did you know lawyers
there get to wear wigs?

16
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,073
I wear a wig to work,
I'm a jackass.

17
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:38,103
All right. I'm ready.
Let's hit it.

18
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,183
We can't go. Tournament.

19
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:40,983
What? We agreed. I suited up...

20
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,610
You take too long
to get ready.

21
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:43,401
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,302
I got the low maintenance,
just-rolled-out-of-bed look.

23
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,923
Yeah, which takes an hour
and a half of waxing,

24
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:49,822
tugging and teasing to achieve.

25
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:51,180
And then he starts on his hair.

26
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:52,033
Ace!

27
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:54,240
Look, are we going or not?

28
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,902
Just go without us.
We'll be there in five minutes.

29
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:56,662
Really?

30
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:57,860
- Yes!
- Yes!

31
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:59,310
All right, I'm going
down to the bar.

32
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,750
I'm ordering three beers.
I'll see you guys in five minutes.

33
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:04,151
Three beers, five minutes.

34
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:07,732
Thanks for lending me these boots.
Where'd you get them from?

35
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:10,681
This store in the Village
had one of those crazy sales.

36
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,402
It was a footwear feeding frenzy.

37
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,573
I saw it first!

38
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:19,840
You just made the list, bitch!

39
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:21,463
So many questions.

40
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:23,711
Firstly, what do you think would
happen if a guy walked into that store

41
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,792
wearing a suit of boots?

42
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,681
You look fantastic in them, Robin.

43
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:30,840
But don't you think they're
a little high for that dress?

44
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:33,602
Well, that's the point: It's to hide
that fact that I haven't shaved my legs.

45
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:36,011
I've begun a strict no-shave policy

46
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:37,003
for the first three dates.

47
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,323
It's all about self-control.

48
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,571
If I don't shave, I must behave.

49
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:42,762
FYI: It doesn't matter, baby.

50
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:45,530
Guys just want to get on the green.
They don't mind going through the rough.

51
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:47,173
Shh-clackey!

52
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:49,832
Stinson.

53
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,550
All right, the beers are here.

54
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:52,703
<i>Yeah, we're not going to make it.</i>

55
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,822
Oh, come on! We agreed...

56
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:56,272
Did Marshall take his pants off?

57
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:57,402
Yeah, pants are off.

58
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,713
This is Wimbledon, Ted.

59
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:01,712
I need the freedom and mobility
that only underwear can provide.

60
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:02,740
Cheerio!

61
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:04,992
Fine.

62
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,580
I don't need friends.
I got you guys.

63
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,373
You guys are my friends,

64
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,591
my cold refreshing friends.

65
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:13,401
I'm talking to beer.

66
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:16,583
Ted? Trudy.

67
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:18,903
Trudy.

68
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,611
Oh, my God. I haven't
seen you since...

69
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,853
I slept with you then
climbed down the fire escape.

70
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,180
That was you?

71
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:29,151
I'm kidding.

72
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:31,210
I was super-wasted...

73
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:33,491
That night...
These are not all for me.

74
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:36,860
No, I was going to call you,
but I was so embarrassed.

75
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:38,060
You were embarrassed?

76
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:41,323
I was like, "I really like this guy,
and now I'm climbing out his window,"

77
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:43,152
and I forgot my underwear...

78
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:45,812
Those were yours?
God, I thought they felt kind of tight.

79
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,931
I'm kidding.
I don't wear underwear.

80
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,003
Ladies' underwear. Often.

81
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,890
Ah! Again, I'm kidding.

82
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,433
I'm so glad I ran into you.

83
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:55,762
I know. Do you want to...?

84
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:56,711
Trudy?!

85
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:58,120
No way!

86
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:00,702
Oh, my God!
Rachel, how are you?

87
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,681
- Ted, this is Rachel.
- Hi!

88
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:08,350
- Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Whoo!
- Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Whoo!

89
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,551
Wait, let me guess.
You guys met in prison.

90
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:14,420
No! We were sorority sisters.

91
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,443
And best friends forever
all sophomore year.

92
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,291
When we weren't
at each other's throats.

93
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:22,491
We could be so competitive.
Uh, but that's all behind us now.

94
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:27,171
Hey, mista! Hey, mista!
Stay away from my sista! Whoo!

95
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:29,822
We have so much
catching up to do.

96
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,293
Okay. Are you going to
Stacey's wedding?

97
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:33,003
Oh, it's off. Apparently,
he's into dudes.

98
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,103
Nah! Again?!
That's like her third one.

99
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:35,980
<i>I know!</i>

100
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:39,020
Well, beers,
what do you want to do?

101
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:42,331
We could stay here... or I know
this other place called "My Belly."

102
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,440
So, Trudy and I got a table.

103
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,480
Oh, that's cool. I was going to get out
of here anyway. I'm really tired.

104
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,030
I want you to stay.

105
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:52,182
Tired of people who fold early,
'cause I am wide awake!

106
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,330
Okay, guys... be cool.

107
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,490
How I met your mother 3x03
<i>- Third Wheel -</i>

108
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,933
- A-kaza-oui!
- Aah!

109
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,583
You've been vanquished, old bean.

110
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:17,522
That's 'cause you distracted me.

112
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:20,262
You've been hanging crumpet
ever since the third set.

114
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:25,091
Ah... Stinson.

116
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:27,170
I've got a situation.

117
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,251
Trudy is here... you know,
from the pineapple incident?

118
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:32,060
Oh, you mean the girl
that chalked your pool cue

119
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,250
and then snuck down
the fire escape? Respect.

120
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:37,242
So, we're hitting it off
and then her friend shows up

121
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,803
and they're kind of competitive.

122
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,461
I think the new girl's
kind of into me.

123
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,823
So you now have two on the line?

124
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,612
- And I don't know which one to go for.
- <i>Go for the new girl!</i>

125
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,821
Given the choice, always party
with Dr. Strangelove.

126
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:49,410
New girl? What new girl?

127
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,603
Two girls are allegedly vying
for Ted's affections, and I think...

128
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,002
Oh, you don't know what you're
talking about. Give it to me.

129
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,492
- Are they friends?
- <i>Uh, yeah.</i>

130
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:58,692
Uh, no... I-I don't know.
They're old sorority sisters.

131
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,631
<i>Are they Betas?</i>

132
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,703
Because they're all sluts,
and you can tell them right now

133
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,752
I didn't want to be
in their sorority anyway.

134
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:06,123
They're Kappas, and...

135
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,553
I think I can score with
one of them.

136
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:10,212
I don't know which one, and
if I chose wrong, I lose them both.

137
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:13,472
Okay, well, don't worry. I'll-I'll
come down and help you figure it out.

138
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:15,911
I thought we were in
for the evening?

139
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,431
That's what I thought about your
bangers and mash down there,

140
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,343
but I guess we're both wrong, guv'na.

141
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,833
- Hey.
- Oh, Ted. Okay...

142
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,312
- Settle an argument.
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:28,610
Is it stealing if you go out
with someone's boyfriend

144
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,492
after they've broken up?

145
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,349
- Well, that's very complicated...
- See?! He agrees with me.

146
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,147
You're such a little man-thief.

147
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,781
You're the man-thief, man-thief.

148
00:05:36,808 --> 00:05:38,783
Oh, somebody should lock
you girls up.

149
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,530
You're so funny.

150
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,773
I think Ted is funny.

151
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:45,760
Really?

152
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:48,752
I think Ted is hilarious.

153
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,903
I am never not wearing
a suit again.

154
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,870
- Hello?
- It's me. I'm at the bar. Don't look.

155
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:58,290
- Just call me "Mom."
- Uh, hey, mom. How's dad's...

156
00:05:58,435 --> 00:05:59,240
Colon?

157
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:01,931
<i>What? What's the matter with you?</i>

158
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:05,002
Anyway, both of these girls
are into you; take your pick.

159
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:07,082
- They are? Are you sure?
- Yes, of course.

160
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,510
<i>They're playing with their hair
and touching your arm.</i>

161
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:10,960
Classic green light.

162
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:12,381
<i>Are you positive?</i>

163
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:15,142
That is so fascinating.

164
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:16,761
So what happened?

165
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,880
Well, after 18 hours of surgery,
I closed,

166
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:21,731
and, thankfully, both girls just
celebrated their second birthday.

167
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,052
Wow. Gosh, separating
conjoined twins,

168
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,770
that must be
the most amazing feeling.

169
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,843
True, but now the parents
don't know what to do

170
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,162
with their huge supply
of four-legged overalls.

171
00:06:33,537 --> 00:06:36,620
That is so funny.
You're so funny.

172
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:40,040
Positive.
They both want you bad.

173
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,660
It's a clearance sale
and you're the boots, baby.

174
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:47,250
- Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.
- Bye, mom.

175
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,260
That's my mom.

176
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:51,561
- Hello?
- Bring me a razor.

177
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:54,803
What about the no-shave rule?
What happened to your convictions?

178
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,991
They've been surgically removed
by Dr. Awesome.

179
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,401
No, I'm not doing it.

180
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,952
The whole point
to not shaving was to...

181
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:01,761
Lily, please!

182
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:05,130
He's really cute, and I really like him,
and he's got a British accent.

183
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:06,381
I'm on my way.

184
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:09,711
So this college boyfriend,
who, who won him?

185
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,600
Neither of us. He left.

186
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:13,921
Junior year abroad.

187
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:16,220
It's really too bad, 'cause...

188
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:19,831
there was that...
one thing we wanted to do.

189
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,311
We were going to do...

190
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:24,102
- but we never did.
- Why?

191
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,631
Wait, what were you guys going
to do but never did?

192
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,021
No, it's too embarrassing.

193
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,281
- You tell him.
- No, you tell him.

194
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:31,433
- No, I don't care if you don't care.
- Well, I don't care. I just...

195
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,562
Nobody cares! Just say it.

196
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:36,542
Why don't we tell him together.

197
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:39,822
Okay. On three.

198
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,391
One...

199
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,723
Well, he's right: It's a dead heat.

200
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,032
two...

201
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:48,173
Neither one is giving ground. I could not
tell who was the third wheel.

202
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:49,842
...three.

203
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,440
It's a tricycle.

204
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:54,563
- No way, no way, no way!
- What's happening?

205
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:57,771
<i>- It's a tricycle.</i>
- No way, no way, no way.

206
00:07:58,115 --> 00:07:59,570
It's a tricycle.

207
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,442
Well, I'll just say it right now.
All sorority girls are sluts.

208
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,701
Put him on speaker.

209
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:08,401
So what you're saying to us right now
is that you have a shot at the belt?

210
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:09,840
Wait-wait-wait. What belt?

211
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,013
Well, Barney and I have
this running joke that the first guy

212
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,763
to actually pull this off
would "win" the championship belt.

213
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:17,390
Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?

214
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,701
Behold...

215
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:24,121
- You actually bought a belt.
- That's right. It's resplendent.

216
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:28,113
Come on, it was just a thing we said.
We were kidding around.

217
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:29,132
I never kid.

218
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,613
Remember you said if I ever
slept with that girl

219
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:32,511
from Days of Our Lives,
I'd be the king?

220
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,492
Well...

221
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,710
Why wasn't I told about the belt?
I could go for the belt.

222
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:48,091
If Lily would've died before me,
then I could ride the tricycle.

223
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:51,071
If I died, I would just come back
and haunt your penis.

224
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:53,362
Guys, come on! Help me out.
What do I do?

225
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:56,122
All right, Ted, if you're going
to go for the belt,

226
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:58,250
then the bylaws require me
to ask the following questions:

227
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:02,053
One: Is the aggregate age
of all participants under 83?

228
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:02,881
Yes.

229
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:06,493
Two: Is the aggregate weight
of all participants under 400 pounds?

230
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:07,791
Yes.

231
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,392
Theodore Mosby...

232
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:13,023
- are you paying these women?
- What? No.

233
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,300
Ted...

234
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,080
No. Look, I got to go.

235
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:18,653
They're going to think I inherited
my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.

236
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,043
Oh, are you guys leaving?

237
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:23,911
Well,

238
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,322
it is getting pretty late.

239
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:28,240
Right. Well, well, it's been...

240
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:31,382
Maybe we could all go listen to that
Wilco CD you talked about before.

241
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,793
Great!

242
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:37,102
I have it right upstairs. It's in my
apartment upstairs. Let's go upstairs.

243
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:39,083
I'm sorry. Where was your
apartment again?

244
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,942
Ha, that's funny. I love that.

245
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,460
You should tell more jokes
in my apartment upstairs.

246
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:51,491
Scenario #12:
We're in a horrific car crash.

247
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,630
You die. I'm left paralyzed.

248
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:56,203
Two sexy nurses,
with a six-pack of wine coolers,

249
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:57,693
sneak into my room
late at night.

250
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:59,990
I try to blink at them
in Morse code.

251
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:01,703
"Please, don't.

252
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:03,551
I love my dead wife."

253
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,860
But they're medical professionals,
and I got to think,

254
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,490
somehow, they're saving my life.

255
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:12,400
Fine. Sleep with your nurses.
tonight you ride the unicycle.

256
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,451
I already did this morning.

257
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:18,593
- Hello.
- Lily,

258
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,181
I have pounded three
cappuccinos waiting for you.

259
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:25,103
Pretty soon, I won't have to shave,
the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.

260
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,663
I'm sorry, I can't leave now.

261
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:30,251
Lily, he can't see my legs like this.
I look like a Turkish lesbian.

262
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:35,763
There's, um, a pharmacy across the street.
Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?

263
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,300
No, but 50 will.

264
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:41,553
Hold on. Ted's texting me.

265
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,782
"We're combing up-sars."

266
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,470
"Combing up-sars."
What does that mean?

267
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,161
It means they're coming upstairs.

268
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:55,561
My pants, where's my pants?

269
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:56,561
Where's my pants?

270
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:58,461
Got 'em.

271
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,853
Ooh! Nice place.

272
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,981
- Hey, are these your roommates?
- Yes.

273
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:08,391
Uh, yes,
but they are not here.

274
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,112
They are somewhere else.

275
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:11,891
We have total privacy because

276
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:13,980
privacy is essential when you're

277
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,401
listening to music.

278
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:19,702
You know what else is essential when
you're listening to music?

279
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,100
Music.

280
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,272
That's hilarious.
You are hilarious!

281
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:28,472
I'll go get it in my bedroom.
The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom...

282
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:31,052
Okay. We'll try
and stay out of trouble.

283
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,241
Of course,
we can't promise anything.

284
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:37,060
This is going to be awesome.

285
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,633
No!

286
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:45,893
What you guys doing here?
I've got... I've got... I've got...

287
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,841
We know, we know, Ted, well done.

288
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:50,073
This is very impressive. Up top.

289
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:52,942
- Yeah, bro, up top.
- Oh, don't be gross.

290
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,360
You guys need to get out of here.
Please, take the fire escape.

291
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:56,600
No, no way.

292
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:59,851
The other day I saw a pigeon take
a crap on it and the whole thing..

293
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:00,792
shifted.

294
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,222
Oh, you can use our bedroom.

295
00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:06,033
Okay, all I need to seal the deal
is the Wilco CD, Barney.

296
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:11,840
What are you doing?!

297
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:14,202
I cannot allow Ted to do this.

298
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:15,363
Wh-what? Why?

299
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:17,361
Because the belt is my birthright!

300
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:20,693
You cannot claim it before I do.
That would be like Jimmy Olsen

301
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:23,910
capturing Lex Luthor while Superman
watches impotently from the bedroom.

302
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:27,540
But, Barney, you've done
way dirtier stuff than Ted.

303
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,191
You're disgusting.

304
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,871
I've never ridden the tricycle.

305
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:34,723
I was on the verge last year.
I was so close.

306
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:42,310
So ladies, why don't we move this party
to a more horizontal location?

307
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:46,262
Oh, my God, my new carpet!
Oh, my God, this is a disaster.

308
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:48,200
- You get the carpet cleaner. I'll get a towel.
- Okay.

309
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,391
I'll get the video camera.

310
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,291
- Get out!
- Okay then.

311
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:54,741
So let me get this straight.
You're going to trike-block me?

312
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,320
That is so petty.
It's like you're...

313
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:59,611
- Tom Petty.
- Tom Petty.

314
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,192
You're Tom Petty.

315
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,511
Where's Lily?

316
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,183
Still looking for that CD, so...

317
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,353
- What are you doing?
- I knew it. I had a hunch

318
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:15,213
about that girl and
I was right.

319
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,750
I saw it first!

320
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,640
You just made the list, bitch.

321
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:25,671
I cannot give up my bedroom
to a boot thief.

322
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,543
She should be punished,
not rewarded.

323
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,270
Fine, then I'll try to work in a little
light spanking. Just do this for me!

324
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:31,323
No, never.

325
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:33,601
What if I reimburse you
for the boots, full retail?

326
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,641
- Please enjoy our bedroom.
- Great. Just take it.

327
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:38,940
Okay, wish me luck.

328
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:48,513
- Oh, my God.
- You're such a girl.

329
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:52,603
- Where's the shaving cream?
- You didn't ask me for shaving cream.

330
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:55,230
Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor
without buying shaving cream?

331
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:57,152
Well, who doesn't shave
their legs for a date?

332
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:59,633
Well, who's not getting a tip
because of her attitude?

333
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:00,992
Well, here's a little tip for you:

334
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:03,882
shave your legs before you leave
the house, Sasquatch.

335
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:10,130
Hey, Robin, um, the valet's
brought the car around.

336
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:12,182
I thought we'd go to my place,

337
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,411
- if you're in the mood for a nightcap.
- Absolutely.

338
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:18,472
I just have to go to the ladies' room.
I've got TB.

339
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:20,171
Tiny bladder.

340
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,873
- I'll meet you out front.
- Yeah.

341
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:39,233
You've got to be kidding me.

342
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,183
Excuse me. Sorry.

343
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:05,790
So, I'm having a little trouble
finding the CD.

344
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,373
That's okay.

345
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:11,783
We don't need music...
to have fun.

346
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,171
Exactly.

347
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:17,721
You do like to have fun,
don't you, Ted?

348
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:30,200
It's getting late.
I'll get your coats.

349
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:36,050
- "I'll get your coats"?!
- I don't know why I said that.

350
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:38,102
Why'd I say that?
It's the opposite of what I meant.

351
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,333
I wanna take clothes off them,
not put more on.

352
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:43,170
Ted, you're ruining this
for everyone.

353
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,663
Leave him alone!

354
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:48,682
Sometimes even the greatest warriors
shoot themselves in the foot.

355
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,123
What are you talking about?

356
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,450
If you must know, it wasn't
a freak beverage malfunction

357
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:56,621
that stopped me from riding
the tricycle that night.

358
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,242
So, Barney,

359
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:02,491
why don't we take this party to
a more, horizontal location?

360
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:17,952
- Oh, no, the night's ruined!
- No, baby, it's not.

361
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:20,362
Yes, it is! Whatever this night
was heading towards is ruined.

362
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:21,570
Where's my coat?

363
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:24,922
Why would you do that
to yourself?

364
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,590
Because you get up
in your head, man.

365
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,232
You start thinking,
"I can't do this. It's two women."

366
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,400
That's two of everything,
four of some things.

367
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:35,312
The logistics alone are enough
to cripple even a pro like me.

368
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:39,923
See, if a complete degenerate like
Barney choked, what chance do I have?

369
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:42,511
The best chance in the world.

370
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,882
Fear took the belt from me.

371
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:50,873
Fear rode the tricycle that night,
my friends.

372
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:54,110
But fear will not get
a second turn.

373
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,450
- It won't?
- No.

374
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:00,611
Because I now realize
it isn't my destiny to win the belt.

375
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,752
It is my destiny to help
my friend win it.

376
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:07,910
Ted is fated to go there first.

377
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:11,052
He is our Neil Armstrong.

378
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:14,900
Spacesuit up, Ted,
'cause you're going to the moon.

379
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:15,830
Step one.

380
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,142
Ladies.

381
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:24,032
I couldn't find your coats,
but I did find... tequila.

382
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,053
Wait, wait, wait,
a remote control fireplace?

383
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,690
We don't have a remote control fireplace.

384
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:33,882
Right, that's my apartment.
The dressing gown's mine, too.

385
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:36,173
Damn, this should be me.
Anyway, continuing...

386
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,410
I am so exhausted.

387
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:47,721
So exhausted.

388
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,850
Wait, why would I want
to tire them out?

389
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,840
That's your excuse to unleash
pretext for physical contact #1.

390
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:01,852
You give the most amazing
foot massage.

391
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:05,792
That's 'cause I used to practice
all the time on my grandmother.

392
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,203
Why in God's name
would I say that?

393
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:10,232
It's endearing.
You're a caregiver.

394
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:12,331
Never take family values
out of the equation.

395
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,202
Step three.

396
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:17,200
Ted, what's wrong?

397
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,821
I was just thinking about
this documentary I saw once

398
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,861
about something
called a super volcano.

399
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:26,870
Okay, what the hell?

400
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,050
Wait for it.

401
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:30,030
It can happen at any time.

402
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:32,822
And obliterate all life on Earth,

403
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:36,672
which is why
I live by three simple words.

404
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:40,332
Don't postpone joy.

405
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:43,460
Oh, my God.

406
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:46,623
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

407
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:53,681
The mortality angle.
That's actually pretty good.

408
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:58,382
- I can do this.
- Yes, you can.

409
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:01,453
I can't believe I'm going to say this,
but I'm actually moved.

410
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:04,723
- Bring it in, guys.
- All right.

411
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,501
I'll see you on the other side.

412
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:48,071
So what happened next?
Did you do it?

413
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,210
It doesn't seem right
to talk about it.

414
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:53,191
What? No! Tell me.

416
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:57,992
Don't tell me because you don't have to
because you didn't do it.

418
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,481
You didn't do it.

419
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:00,543
You did it.

420
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,122
You did it, didn't you?

421
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:03,032
Did you?

422
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,381
You didn't do it.
Yes, you did.

423
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,431
You did. No, you didn't.
Tell me!

424
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:11,941
Some stories you tell,
some stories you don't.

425
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:14,902
That's because you didn't do it.

426
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,312
He didn't do it.

427
00:20:16,688 --> 00:20:19,970
You did it. You did it.
You did it. Tell me, did you?

428
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:23,210
Ted, belt. Did you?
Did you or didn't you?

429
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:24,012
Did?

430
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:27,410
Tell me, please. For the love...
Do you know if he did or didn't?

431
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:31,520
Oh, hey, um, would you go
in there and see if my date's okay?

432
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,120
- No problem.
- Thank you.

433
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:45,572
No, nobody's in there,
but the window's actually open.

434
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:47,640
I guess I shouldn't be
so surprised.

435
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:49,692
I mean, she was acting weird
all night, right?

436
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:52,301
Yeah, you know...

437
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:54,920
why don't I buy you a drink?

438
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:56,530
Okay.

439
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,390
Did I overhear
that you're a surgeon?

440
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:03,052
- Guilty as charged.
- Oh, you're so funny.

441
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,761
I'm here! I'm fine!

442
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:09,590
My head is bleeding.

443
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:10,900
Going down again.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
