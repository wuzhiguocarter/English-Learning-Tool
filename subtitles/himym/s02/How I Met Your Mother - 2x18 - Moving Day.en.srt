1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,900
Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything
was great between me and Robin.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
So we decided to try
and make it even better.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,500
We decided to move in together.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,400
So, I can have the moving
truck here by 8:00 am.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,800
Does that sound
good to everybody?

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,900
By the way,
what are you guys doing with Ted's room?

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,800
'Cause if you need help with the rent,
I'll take it.

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,600
Why would you want
to live with us?

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,100
I don't call what
you guys do "living."

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,400
Here's the deal,
I need a room closer to the bar.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,900
It takes me exactly 23 minutes

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,600
to get a girl from the
bar back to my apartment.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
A lot can go wrong
in 23 minutes.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,100
This is going to be so hot.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,100
She's paying.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,900
I swear,
if he doesn't call me back,

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,300
I'm going to go
through with this.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,500
Please hurry, sir.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,700
I want to do dirty
stuff with you.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Stuff I won't let him do.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,400
Every red light run
is an extra $20.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Baby?

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,700
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It was all my fault.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,100
I am so drunk.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,400
When I'm this drunk,
I go crazy!

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
I bet you do.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Check this out.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,200
What up NYPD?

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,200
So close.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,200
See? If I had a room here all I
have to do is get them upstairs.

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
Come on, guys. It'll be great!

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
We'll come in after
you guys are asleep

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,000
and I'll be gone
before you wake up.

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,900
So, you get to have sex and we get to
wake some skanky girl up in the morning

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,300
and kick her out?

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,600
God, Lily.

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Some guy just told her that he loved
her then pretended to go to the bathroom

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,800
and never came back
you can't make her a cup of coffee?

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,200
Real nice.

www.forom.com

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,000
I put all your heavy jackets
in this box marked "winter."

43
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,800
And all your colorful sweaters
in this box marked "Bill Cosby."

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Make fun,
but America loved that guy for a reason.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,500
Wow!

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,800
Almost done.

47
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,200
Not so fast.

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,100
Take your sword.

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,800
Wow.

50
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,800
- End of an era.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,100
It's a bummer to break up the set,
but you're going to need that sword.

52
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,200
It's true--
my building is infested with dragons.

53
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,100
Looks like our little boy
is finally moving out.

54
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,600
It seems like just yesterday
he was a cute little freshmen.

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,700
Discovering Reggae
and ultimate Frisbee.

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,200
He did it later than the other
kids but we never pushed him.

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,700
We knew he'd get there.

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
You haven't moved in yet,
have you?

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,700
Good. You guys have
to take this quiz.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,100
I found it in a magazine.

61
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,100
It's called the "Are you ready
to move in together?" quiz.

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Well, if it's anything like you're
"Are you wearing panties" quiz,

63
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm out.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,300
Question one,

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,400
Ted, "Do you want to
move in with Robin?"

66
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,300
Mm. Yes.

67
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, you got the
first one wrong.

68
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,100
The answer is "no," you
secretly want to be single

69
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,300
and hang out with your
awesome friend Barney."

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,700
Question two.

71
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Robin, "Do you think you can
score a hotter guy than Ted?"

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,900
Correct. The answer
was awkward silence.

73
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Question three, "Did I just make
up this quiz to prove a point?"

74
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,800
Yes.

75
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,400
Yes, I did.

76
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,100
Really? You mean it's not from
Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,000
So? We all agree?

78
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,500
We move Ted's
stuff back up here?

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Mm... no.
We're still moving in together.

80
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,900
Why? This is crazy.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Ted you're throwing your life away.
This girl is blinding you.

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,600
With her shiny hair and
her boobed shaped boobs.

83
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,100
This is bad for you,
too, you know.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,300
How are you going to feel when
he sees you without any makeup?

85
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm not wearing
makeup right now.

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,000
Holy crap, you're beautiful.

87
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,200
All right then, how will you feel when
you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,900
Oh, come on,
Robin doesn't smoke.

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,400
Wait, do you?

90
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,200
Of course not. Why?

91
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't tell me how
to live my life!

92
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,900
Ted, I can't let you do this.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Come on. This is happening.

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,000
So instead of fighting it why,
why don't you just help?

95
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,200
- You want me to help you?
- Yeah.

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,400
Okay, Ted.

97
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,600
I'll help you.

98
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
Can't believe we actually
got him to take a box down.

99
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,400
Maybe he's finally
getting on board.

100
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,100
Where's the truck?

101
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,500
Where's Barney?

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,300
Wait for it.

103
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,600
I can't believe this! Everything
I own in the world is in there.

104
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,500
Except for this
box of pot lids.

105
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
And the sword.

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm going to kill him.
I swear to God I'm going to kill him!

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that.
For now.

108
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,900
Marshall, we live alone.

109
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,400
This is so great!

110
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,300
We can finally do all the things we always
said we wanted to do if we lived alone.

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh, I know what I
want to start with.

112
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,500
So, here we are, right?

113
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,800
Sitting around the
apartment naked.

114
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
- Awesome.
- Yep.

115
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,100
It's not as awesome as
I thought it would be.

116
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,300
- My butt itches.
- I'm cold.

117
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,700
I noticed.

118
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,900
Yeah, like you're
one to talk, Pointy.

119
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,500
Barney, I don't know if you
got my other 47 messages,

120
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,300
but if my stuff isn't here within
the hour I'm calling the cops.

121
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,500
This is the last time
I'm calling you.

122
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,100
Because my charger's in
the back of the truck.

123
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,900
Don't worry, it's Barney.
He'll bring the stuff back.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
No, it's just... I was really looking
forward to settling in, you know?

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,200
Maybe setting up my TV.

126
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Watching a movie in bed.

127
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,700
What?

128
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,400
Do we really want a
TV in the bedroom?

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,300
I thought we did.

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not sure that we do.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
Well, where else
would we put my TV?

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
We could just put it in our
storage unit in the basement.

133
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
But wouldn't we miss my TV?

134
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,600
- Would we?
- Yes, we would.

135
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,300
We've had that TV
for a long time

136
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,400
and we would feel more at home
if it were setup in our bedroom.

137
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,500
- We need wine, don't we?
- Yes, we do.

138
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,500
Should we, um,
move this to the bedroom?

139
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
Why?

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Ted doesn't live here anymore.

141
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,300
We can do it wherever we want.

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,100
You know what else?

143
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
We don't have to
be quiet anymore.

144
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
We can be as loud as we want.

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Okay, I think we need to
lay down some ground rules.

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,700
Just because we can be loud
doesn't mean we have to be loud.

147
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,200
And although it
might turn you on,

148
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,500
you screaming,
"I'm the best," doesn't do much for me.

149
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Well, it's a lot better than yelling,
"Ted's not here," over and over again.

150
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,200
Well, at least what
I said is true.

151
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,800
Well, that was unnecessary.

152
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,600
Well, since I only have one box I
figure I might as well unpack it.

153
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,900
Mm, where do you think
we should put it?

154
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Well, unless you have a separate pot
lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What?

156
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,300
Uh, the thing is my
kitchen is kind of small.

157
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,700
And, um,
I already have a bunch of pot lids

158
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,600
and mine come with pots, so...

159
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,800
You're saying there's no way to make
room for the single box of stuff

160
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
I try to move into our place?

161
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,200
Well, why don't you just
take it down to the...

162
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,900
Do not say storage space.

163
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,300
I was going to say Dumpster.

164
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,500
Damn it, Robin,
this is all I have left in the world--

165
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,100
eight pot lids and a sword.

166
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,700
Yeah, about the sword.

167
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,400
Hello.

168
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.

169
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,100
Barney, I know it's you.
Where's my stuff?

170
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,300
It's not me.

171
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,500
If you want to see your
precious possessions again,

172
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,100
put on the suit.

173
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,000
What suit?

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Ding-dong. Oh, what's that?
The doorbell.

175
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,700
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

176
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,900
I haven't gotten
to the door yet.

177
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,600
Oh, okay,
let me know when you get there.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,700
Okay, I opened it.
And there's a suit there.

179
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,900
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

180
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
- Barney....
- This isn't Barney.

181
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
But I hear that guy's awesome.

182
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,900
All right.
Listen very carefully.

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You will get your stuff back if you are
able to complete a series of challenges.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,600
Number one, put on the suit.

185
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Number two,
meet me at McClaren's in an hour.

186
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,700
How will I know who to look
for since we've never met?

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,500
I look like Barney.

188
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, hey, Ted.

189
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Suit and sneakers.

190
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,300
A little Ellen DeGeneres
but you pull it off.

191
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,500
I don't have any other shoes
because you stole them along

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,400
with everything else
I own in the world.

193
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,900
Where's the truck, Barney?

194
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,200
Barney.

195
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,800
People's whose trucks I'm not
holding for ransom call me Barney.

196
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,000
I think you should
call me The Commodore.

197
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,800
- I'm not calling you...
- You're not getting your stuff back.

198
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,800
Can I please have
my stuff back...

199
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,600
The Commodore?

200
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,800
No.

201
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,600
Here's the deal,
Ted, you're my bro.

202
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,100
And you're about to become a henpecked,
beaten down, shell of a man.

203
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,300
So tonight, we are going to have one
last awesome night together as bros.

204
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
It's a bro-ing away party.

205
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,500
A special bro-casion.

206
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,300
A bro-choice rally.

207
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
Bro-time at the Apollo.

208
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,500
Oh, bro me.

209
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,400
Well, so what do I have to do?

210
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,700
No, it's not what you have to do,
it's what you want to do,

211
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,400
and you want to
have a good time

212
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,500
before you go take Fun Ted
out back and shoot him.

213
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
So... first thing
on the docket...

214
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,000
- get me that girl's number.
- Absolutely not.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Mm. That's too bad.

216
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,400
Hey, hypothetical question:
if I was all your stuff,

217
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,900
would I rather be at the bottom
of the East River or The Hudson?

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Hey, look,
world's strongest man is on.

219
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,900
Ooh, it's the one where
Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus

220
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,800
from the Partridge
family with his teeth.

221
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,300
It's the best one.
Hey, Ted, get in...

222
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,200
- We live alone.
- Yay.

223
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,100
Well, I win.

224
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
You need to give my
friend your phone number.

225
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,900
Wow, I really didn't think Lou
Ferrigno could pull that bus.

226
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,700
Are you sure this is live?
It looks pretty old.

227
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah, that's 'cause the,
uh, TV is old.

228
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,200
So, I'll, uh,
call you tomorrow?

229
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,300
Yeah. Um, not too early.
I have church.

230
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,000
You were impressive, buddy.

231
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,900
Nice work.
All right, next challenge.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,700
No. No next challenge. Look, this is
my first night living with Robin.

233
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,000
She's probably pissed I'm
spending it out with you.

234
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
This might be our last hurrah,
my little friend.

235
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,400
Marshall, I am gonna cook you
the best dinner of your life.

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,700
How would you like a...

237
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,500
one-egg omelet with
some ketchup and film?

238
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Guess Ted's the one
who did the shopping.

239
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,800
Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!

240
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,300
Guess the microwave
was Ted's, too.

241
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Yeah.

242
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,600
So were all the towels.

243
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,100
Turns out that everything that was
useful in this apartment was Ted's.

244
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Everything that was a Foghat poster we
bought ironically in college was mine.

245
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,100
Marshall.

246
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,500
Yeah, baby?

247
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,300
I miss Ted.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,800
Is it too soon to call him?

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,300
No, we shouldn't.

250
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,500
I don't want to interrupt his
first night living with Robin.

251
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,500
Ha, nice shooting.

252
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,100
You know, if we win this one it's free onion
rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.

253
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,100
What a bargain.

254
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,100
We only had to spend
20 bucks a game.

255
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,900
Admit it, you're having fun.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,100
Maybe.

257
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,300
I mean, it was pretty funny when that
little girl fell over that space barrel.

258
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,500
Nice... We win.

259
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,700
Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--
what up?

260
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Okay. Let's go one more.

261
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
- I don't know.
- You know you want to.

262
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,800
All right, let's do it--
I just got to call Robin real quick.

263
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh, so that's what it's
gonna be like from now on?

264
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,800
No. Okay, okay. You call your old
lady and ask permission to have fun.

265
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,800
Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating
our victory onion rings Han style.

266
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,400
Solo.

267
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,200
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, sweetie listen,

268
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,700
I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be
pretty late, so don't wait up.

269
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, it's totally fine.
You do what you got to do.

270
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
Thanks. You're the best.
I love you.

271
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
I love you, too. Bye.

272
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,800
Hey, sorry about that.
Thanks for holding.

273
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,300
Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel
my subscription to Guns and Ammo,

274
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
that would be great.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,500
No, it's a great magazine.
Really great.

276
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,300
They've printed
three of my letters.

277
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
It's just that my
boyfriend is moving in

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,700
and he kind of doesn't approve
of the whole gun thing.

279
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,800
A free hand grenade phone?

280
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,100
You know what?
Let me give you my work address.

281
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,000
I did it, baby!

282
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,000
I got beer. I got food.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,900
We don't need Ted anymore.

284
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,100
I am the provider of
this apartment now,

285
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,800
and I have provided!

286
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,000
"Provode"? Provided.

287
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,000
Anyway, I got us
everything we need.

288
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,000
Could you toss me
the toilet paper?

289
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,700
Be right back, baby. Sit tight.

290
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,800
Hey, I got to admit, um...
I didn't think I would, but, uh...

291
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,700
I had a really
good time tonight.

292
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
You're a good friend, Barney.

293
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,100
Hey, man, why don't you, uh...

294
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,500
why don't you tell me
where my truck is.

295
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,500
No, I don't think so.

296
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,100
Where's my truck?!

297
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you know why I haven't given you
any of your possessions back yet?

298
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,900
Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk
of the British Royal Douchery?

299
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Because you don't
want them back.

300
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,300
You could've left at any time tonight,
but you didn't, Ted.

301
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Why is that?

302
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,600
Because I didn't want to go back
to Robin's without my stuff.

303
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,800
False. You know what I think?

304
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,200
I think you spent one day with
her and it already sucked.

305
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
I think you didn't like being there,
she didn't like having you there

306
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,900
and you both realized that
you made a huge mistake.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,100
And that's why you spent your
first night living with Robin

308
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,700
out playing laser tag with me.

309
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
And that's why
three seconds ago

310
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,700
you didn't call it "my place"
or "our place" or "home,"

311
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
you called it "Robin's."

312
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,900
You know what?

313
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,700
You can keep my stuff.

314
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,200
- Hey.
- Hey, did you get the truck back?

315
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,300
No.

316
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,800
Why not? What happened?

317
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, he pissed me off so much,
I left.

318
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,800
Anyway, I just wanted to come back here,
space out and watch a movie.

319
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,600
Do you anything that
wasn't made by John Woo?

320
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,600
Why, do you?

321
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,500
You know, forget the movie.
I just want to sit.

322
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,800
What?

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,200
It's just I eat at that table.

324
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Fine, I'll take my shoes off.

325
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,700
You know, why don't you just
throw me down in the storage space

326
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,900
where you have room for me.

327
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
- Ted, come on.
- No, you come on.

328
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,000
I had to jump through
hoops all night for Barney

329
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,800
and then it took me an hour
to get home because his place

330
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,700
is so far away from the bar.

331
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,300
- Oh, my God.
- What?

332
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,700
I know where Barney
put my truck.

333
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Let's go back to my place.

334
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,600
I bet you my place is closer.

335
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
Here we are.

336
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,000
You live in the loading
dock behind the bar?

337
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I don't live here, baby.
This is just my ride.

338
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,700
No, no, no, no.
I'm not getting into any van,

339
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
I've seen Silence of the Lambs.

340
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,800
Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne
in the back of a moving van.

341
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,100
Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.

342
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,200
Those other Rockettes who
called you slow are crazy.

343
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,800
Oh, my God. I knew it.
You're kidnapping me.

344
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,500
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no, no.

345
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
I can explain.

346
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,700
Hello?

347
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,700
Enjoying the ride?

348
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,000
Ted? Ted, you let us out of here.
You let us out of here this instant!

349
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,600
This isn't Ted.

350
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,100
But I hear that guy's awesome.

351
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,400
So I took Sara home and I took
Barney to a bar near his apartment.

352
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,800
Apparently, that strategy
had never occurred to him.

353
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,200
That poor girl must've
been so confused.

354
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,300
Yeah.

355
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, at least Barney
learned a valuable lesson.

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,400
You do not want to get scissor
kicked in the groin by a Rockette.

357
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,000
So, uh,
I guess we should get you unpacked.

358
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,300
Yeah.

359
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
Yeah, I guess we should.

360
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
Lily... deep within the
Amazonian rainforest,

361
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,100
there is a type of tree that only grows
around the body of an existing tree.

362
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,300
It cannot survive
without this tree.

363
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,500
It is supported...

364
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,100
by this tree.

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,300
Lily, we are that tree.

366
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
- The inside tree or the outside tree?
- The outside tree.

367
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,500
- Shouldn't there be three trees?
- You and I are one tree.

368
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay, look, Lily,
the point is that we grew around Ted

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,300
and without him,
we're slowly dying.

370
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,100
What do we do?

371
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,700
I think we can
marry each other.

372
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But we also have to marry Ted.

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,400
I'll tell you right now, my Dad is
not gonna pay for that wedding.

374
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,400
Ted!

375
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,100
What are you doing here?

376
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,100
Robin and I aren't gonna
move in together after all.

377
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,700
What happened?

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,900
I thought we decided
we were ready?

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
I know.

380
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,300
How did we come to that again?

381
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
I don't remember.
We were fighting?

382
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,800
- It's all so blurry.
- Yeah.

383
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,600
The "let's move in together"
sex was pretty amazing.

384
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,600
I know.

385
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,800
I did that thing with no hands
I normally need both to do.

386
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,200
You know...
I'm really happy with you.

387
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,100
I really happy with you.
The way things are.

388
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,900
Maybe we shouldn't
mess with that.

389
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,700
I don't know that we should.

390
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,300
Hey... I hear the "let's not move in
together" sex is pretty incredible.

391
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,200
Let's go back to my place.

392
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
- Ooh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

393
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,900
- No, thank you.
- You'll be very happy.

394
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,500
Look, I know you guys are really excited
about having the place to yourself.

395
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,400
Until after the wedding, I mean,
if it's not too much of an imposition...

396
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,700
God, this feels so right.

397
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,000
Never leave us again.

398
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,600
Guys, Robin's down in the truck and
there's actually a lot of boxes,

399
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,100
so maybe we should...

400
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,200
Do we have time for this?

401
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my
hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.

402
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,400
The category: top ten things
I would've called my truck...

403
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,200
It was never your truck.

404
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,900
...if Ted hadn't been a
jerk and given it back.

405
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,000
It was a rental.

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,900
Number ten, "The Winne-Bango."

407
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,200
Number nine,
"The Pick-Up Truck."

408
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,500
Number eight,
"The Ford Explore Her."

409
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,700
Number seven,
"The You Scream Truck."

410
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,500
You Scream.

411
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,700
Number six,
"Feels On Wheels." Hello!

412
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,800
Number five,
"The Ride Her Truck."

413
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,700
Number four, "The 18-Squeeler."

414
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,500
Number three, "The Esca-Laid."

415
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,400
Number two, "The Slam-Boney."

416
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,200
and... the number one thing
I would've called my truck

417
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,500
if Ted hadn't been a jerk
and given it back...

418
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,100
"The '69 Chevy."

419
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,700
Sorry.
