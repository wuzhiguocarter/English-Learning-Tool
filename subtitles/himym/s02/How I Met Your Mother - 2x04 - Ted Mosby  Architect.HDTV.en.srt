1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:03,929
Kids, sometimes your relationship 
goes so smoothly for so long

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,143
that you think it will be 
that way forever.

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,421
It never is.

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:09,739
Well, we just had our first fight.

5
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:11,186
We had our first fight.

6
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:12,911
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

7
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,861
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,340
A few months ago, 
my architecture firm was approached

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,567
to design this new building...

10
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:24,822
It's this big skyscraper 
in Spokane.

11
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,590
It'd be a huge project 
for his firm.

12
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,698
And if we don't get it, 
we could go under.

13
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:31,734
So anyway, the head architect 
unveils his new design

14
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:33,162
to the whole company.

15
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:40,082
- No.
- No.

16
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:41,211
Yes.

17
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:44,260
All skyscrapers 
kind of look like a...

18
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,960
Marshall, 
it's a 78-story pink marble tower

19
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:49,541
with a rounded top

20
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:52,452
and two spherical 
entryways at the front.

21
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,361
Wow, so it's the whole package.

22
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,422
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

23
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:59,113
Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, 
you got to get me in.

24
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,451
And don't give me the shaft.

25
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:02,302
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

26
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,600
It's a travesty.

27
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:06,563
It's gonna define 
the skyline of the city.

28
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:09,102
If it was me, I could've 
designed something amazing.

29
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:12,112
Instead, I'm spending 12 hours 
a day designing the cornices.

30
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,870
- Yeah, you did.
- That wasn't one.

31
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,071
So you and Ted 
had your first fight.

32
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:32,752
It obviously ended well. 
I mean, you're here with me.

33
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,573
Actually, 
it didn't end at all.

34
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:36,672
I started getting bummed out, 
so I came here.

35
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:37,670
It's what I do.

36
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,511
When my grandma died, 
I got a perm.

37
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:42,551
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

38
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:45,893
The thing is, 
Ted has been literally

39
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,322
complaining about work 
nonstop for weeks.

40
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:51,831
So, when I came over today, 
I was kind of done.

41
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:53,190
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,192
- How was your day?
- Good.

43
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,032
Wow, you're a great interviewer.

44
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:00,280
Aren't you gonna ask 
how my day was?

45
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,923
No, I know how it was. 
It was awful.

46
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:05,233
Ooh, you want to rent 
a movie tonight?

47
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:06,873
You know, um...

48
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:09,231
I listen to your work 
stories all the time.

49
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,831
Yeah, but... 
and I don't want to be rude here,

50
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:14,440
but my work stories 
are interesting.

51
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:16,512
I'm a television news reporter.

52
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,590
- Robin...
- What?

53
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,351
I knew exactly
 what he was going to say.

54
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:23,060
I was just helping him 
get there faster.

55
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:26,021
You should work 
at a suicide hotline.

56
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:28,172
And then it got ugly.

57
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:31,852
What I don't do is tell you 
the same story over and over again.

58
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,752
I mean, you wouldn't 
watch the same movie

59
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,591
over and over again, would you?

60
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:38,620
Maybe a great movie 
like Die Hard.

61
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:40,280
But Field of Dreams?

62
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:42,492
Once is more than enough.

63
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,593
So that's your go-to bad movie?

64
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,592
The number one example 
on the tip of your tongue

65
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,370
of a bad movie is 
Field of Dreams?

66
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,710
It's about 
ghost baseball players.

67
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,320
I think it's stupid.

68
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:03,611
So, now he's all mad at me 
about the stupid movie.

69
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,382
Robin, he's upset because 
you wouldn't listen to him,

70
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,530
not because you didn't like 
some movie.

71
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:11,741
How do you not like 
Field of Dreams?!

72
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:16,462
Listening is the foundation 
of a relationship.

73
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:18,093
And if he's really droning on,

74
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:20,593
you can always practice 
saying the alphabet backwards.

75
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:23,062
You know, in case 
you get pulled over for a DUI.

76
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,551
I guess I don't know 
how to do that.

77
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:26,990
Yeah, it's really hard, 
even when you're sober.

78
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,960
That's what I tried 
to explain to the cop.

79
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:32,752
No, I mean, I guess I don't know 
how to do this girlfriend thing.

80
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:36,131
I've  never been in a relationship 
this serious before.

81
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,193
I should probably go tell him 
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

82
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,791
You're trying to do it right now, 
aren't you?

83
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,372
What the hell comes before "Q"?

84
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:50,870
Then at the end of the movie when 
he has a catch with his dad, like...

85
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:54,470
like he never did when he was 
young enough for it to matter.

86
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,772
Can we talk about something else?

87
00:03:58,356 --> 00:03:59,581
You know what, dude?

88
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:01,902
Forget about Robin, okay? 
You're hanging with us tonight.

89
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,780
I've got an awome party lined up.

90
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,183
Oh, God.

91
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:08,850
This gonna be another one 
of your weird all-guy parties?

92
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:12,010
That was a poker game. 
What is wrong with you?

93
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,541
No, it's the first law school 
party of the year

94
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,093
and it's gonna be awesome.

95
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:18,001
I haven't seen this guys since, 
like, last year

96
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:19,570
before Lily and I broke up.

97
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:21,870
So I'm gonna have 
to break the news to everybody.

98
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,841
It's really gonna bum them out.

99
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:26,403
This party's gonna suck.

100
00:04:27,055 --> 00:04:29,841
Well, love to join you at that one.

101
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:32,691
But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.

102
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,511
I wish I could join you guys, 
but I got to get back

103
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,582
to my apparently boring job.

104
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:39,122
- Your job's not boring.
- Robin thinks so.

105
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:41,462
Dude, lots of chicks 
think architects are hot.

106
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:44,021
Think about it, 
you create something out of nothing.

107
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:45,172
You're like God.

108
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,211
There's nobody hotter than God.

109
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:49,171
I love it when you quote Scripture.

110
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:53,280
I'm telling you, you should use 
the architect angle with the ladies.

111
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:55,543
Okay, first of all, 
I have a girlfriend.

112
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:58,011
Second, the architect angle 
doesn't even work on her.

113
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:00,941
And, third, I can't imagine 
that working on anyone ever.

114
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:03,301
That's 'cause you're always like...

115
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:06,620
Ted Mosby, architect.

116
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,833
If it were me, I'd be like...

117
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,452
Ted Mosby, architect.

118
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,683
Anything sounds impressive when 
it's said with the right attitude.

119
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:18,801
Marshall Ericksen.

120
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,501
Recently dumped 
and heading to a lame party.

121
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:24,152
Whoa. Whoa, ladies, 
please take it easy.

122
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,380
There's enough of me for everyone.

123
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:27,821
Oh. Hi. Hello.

124
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:29,871
All right. We're gonna take off..

125
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,832
Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.

126
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:35,350
Ted Mosby, architect.

127
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,010
Trust me.

128
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,411
Hey, just out of curiosity.

129
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,143
If a guy told you 
he was an architect,

130
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:52,572
what  would you think of that?

131
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,730
Are you kidding?

132
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,961
Architects are hot.

133
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:59,343
How do you think Mr. Brady 
scored a babe like Carol?

134
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:00,992
Solid point.

135
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,951
She did have hair of gold.

136
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:04,922
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,562
Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?

138
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:11,581
No.

139
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,440
Hey, Lily.

140
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,782
- You still single?
- Yes.

141
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:19,410
You know... I've poured a lot of 
free drinks for you over the years.

142
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:20,820
A lot.

143
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,222
Carl, do you really want 
to be with a woman

144
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,460
who would trade sex for beer?

145
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:27,418
Only if you're into it.

146
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:29,724
It's on me.

147
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:31,262
Thanks.

148
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:32,891
I wonder where Ted went.

149
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:35,473
Ted Mosby, the architect?

150
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:37,610
Actually, yeah.

151
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,790
Oh, he is such a cool guy.

152
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,310
He was here earlier.

153
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:44,690
And what made you decide 
you wanted to become an architect?

154
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,312
Well, you know, soul of an artist,

155
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,631
hands of a master craftsman.

156
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,910
It was inevitable, I guess.

157
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:54,373
I bet you can draw, can't you?

158
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,861
You should draw me.

159
00:06:56,878 --> 00:07:01,122
Well, I could try, but you might end up 
looking like a midcentury tri-level.

160
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:06,070
Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall 
invited me to this party we could all go to.

161
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:07,870
Marshall's great. 
He's just a lawyer,

162
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:11,163
but somebody has to push the paper 
around for us creative types.

163
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,643
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

164
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:17,571
He asked her to a party. 
Oh, my God, are you okay?

165
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,972
Okay? It's awesome. 
It's a win-win.

166
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:22,120
Ted got to vent 
and I don't have to hear it.

167
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:24,322
Maybe after he's done with 
the talkie-talk, he'll come over

168
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,841
and I'll get the fun part.

169
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,623
What is wrong with you?

170
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:32,111
God, I feel like I'm teaching 
love as a second language here.

171
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:35,003
Okay, you know how when 
he tells you boring work stories

172
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:36,451
you're supposed to listen?

173
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:39,420
Well, when he picks up 
some random girl at a bar,

174
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:41,083
you're supposed to freak out.

175
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:44,471
I'm not freaking out 
because in my mind, she's fat.

176
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:47,263
She's a kickboxing instructor.

177
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:50,502
Her ass looks better than my face.

178
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,321
All right, we'll swing by the party.

179
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,752
Now the party was for 
some of Marshall's classmates

180
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,552
from Columbia Law School,

181
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,261
who by day were some of the sharpest

182
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:04,231
and  most serious 
young legal minds in the country.

183
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,182
By night, however...

184
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,043
Damn, these are some 
drunk almost-lawyers.

185
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,783
Okay! Seriously...

186
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,692
who wants to shave my ass?!

187
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:18,981
That guy went on to become 
a Supreme Court justice.

188
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:22,543
Okay, where are 
the guys and the hooker?

189
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:26,292
Yo, what's up, ladies? 
Welcome to the party. Yeah!

190
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,303
Just need you to sign 
this release protecting the host

191
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,093
from any and all responsibility 
should you harm yourself

192
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,211
or a third party.

193
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:33,940
Then freakin' rage! Yeah!

194
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:36,961
Hey, drunk legal dude, um... 
have you seen Marshall Ericksen?

195
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,511
He was with a guy named Ted.

196
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,611
You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?

197
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,262
Man, what a visionary.

198
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:44,373
Yeah, they were here.

199
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:48,350
Awards are nice, 
they look good on my shelf.

200
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,882
But none of that acclaim means 
anything compared to the joy

201
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:54,100
of seeing the sun rise over 
your first building.

202
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,420
Wow.

203
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,322
I would love to watch 
the sun rise with you.

204
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,300
I know you would.

205
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:02,503
It's the job.

206
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:06,291
Dude. You should let us 
shave your ass tonight.

207
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:08,140
No way.

208
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:11,511
Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?

209
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,480
I didn't want to ruin the party 
for everybody this early, but, uh...

210
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:18,790
everyone take a seat.

211
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:25,372
Um... Lily actually called off 
the wedding this summer

212
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,372
to go to San Francisco.

213
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:28,901
So...

214
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,941
we're broken up.

215
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,541
Her name wasn't on 
your lease, was it?

216
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:36,883
'Cause if not, New York state law, 
you're not obligated

217
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:39,371
to give her half the deposit 
when you move.

218
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,303
Yeah,  that's not really the part 
I was worried about, guys.

219
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:45,910
And don't forget the precedent set 
by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.

220
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:48,131
Any personal effects she left 
in your house or dwelling

221
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:51,010
become yours after 30 days.

222
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:55,802
Guys, can we cease and desist 
with the lawyer speak for a minute?

223
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:57,430
Love died.

224
00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:01,191
The love that made you all believe 
in love, that's dead now.

225
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:05,373
You should sue her.

226
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,053
Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?

227
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:10,232
On the grounds of... shut up.

228
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,612
That's our attorney general.

229
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:19,482
See? Marshall's still hung up 
on our breakup.

230
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,710
Why? Because I listened to him.

231
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:24,401
It was a strong 
and nurturing relationship

232
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:27,553
that I threw away like old gum.

233
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:30,891
Not that I'm worried or anything, 
but, um, back to the sun rising

234
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:34,430
over Ted and, uh... oh, 
what tasteful way did you describe her?

235
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,301
The girl with the smackable ass.

236
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:38,773
Yes,  that's the young lady.

237
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:43,511
So, I know the bouncer 
at this techno club, Posers.

238
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,292
Do you feel like dancing?

239
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:48,153
Yeah, okay. 
There is no way Ted went dancing.

240
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,592
Ted hates clubs.

241
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:52,060
Hell, yeah. I love clubs.

242
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:54,340
I mean, I was going to design 
a cathedral tonight,

243
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:57,330
kind of take a whack at the whole 
relationship between God and man conundrum.

244
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,093
But sure, let's go dancing.

245
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,312
Wait, let me just check 
with my friend.

246
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:01,130
Okay.

247
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:03,991
Hey, Marshall. You up for 
some super loud, repetitive music

248
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:05,961
that hasn't changed 
since the mid-90s?

249
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:08,611
Um... only always.

250
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:10,543
Let's go.

251
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:14,280
Dancing? 
He went dancing with this girl?

252
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,461
Okay, maybe this is a little bad.

253
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,131
Dancing is bad. 
Dancing leads to sex.

254
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,423
Did you grow up 
in that Footloose town?

255
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:23,853
I'm calling him. 
I'm telling him that I was wrong

256
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:27,283
and I'm sorry, and I totally want to 
listen to his stupid stories.

257
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:31,310
Yeah, think of another way 
to phrase that and you'll be fine.

258
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:34,223
He's not answering.

259
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,230
Calling Marshall.

260
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,553
Hello.

261
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,281
Marshall, hi, it's Robin. 
Can I talk to Ted?

262
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:44,073
Oh, Robin, hi.

263
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:48,050
Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. 
He's, uh... he's working.

264
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:51,753
Uh, okay. Bye.

265
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,203
Marshall just lied.

266
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:57,750
Ted's cheating on me.

267
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,470
Excuse me. I'm looking for 
a couple guys who came in here earlier.

268
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:07,223
One's about six-four, 210, 
sandy brown hair.

269
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,572
And the other's a cheating bastard.

270
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,493
You're going to need 
to refresh my memory.

271
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:15,911
Okay, fella, baby knows 
how this game's played.

272
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:18,552
How's a $20 help your memory?

273
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:21,342
Thanks, but seriously, 
it was crazy tonight.

274
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:24,013
You really do need 
to refresh my memory.

275
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:25,771
Then can I have the...?

276
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,513
That's cool. You keep that.

277
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,953
So these guys-- 
one of them's an architect.

278
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,410
Ted Mosby, the architect?

279
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,500
That's the one.

280
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,762
Oh, yeah, he was here.

281
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:38,690
And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry. 
You're on your own this time."

282
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:42,573
And that, my dear, 
was the end of that hack's career.

283
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,110
I live across the street.

284
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,320
That is one hell of a non sequitur.

285
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,731
You want to come over?

286
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,032
Well, I don't know.

287
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,533
But I suppose I should at least 
give you a ride home.

288
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:55,021
Hop on.

289
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,911
I'll see you at book club, Vinny.

290
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,552
- Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.
- Nice.

291
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:02,951
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

292
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,433
Galloping.

293
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:08,223
You proved it, all right? The whole 
Ted Mosby, architect things works.

294
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,441
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!

295
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,342
Aren't you a little worried 
that a certain somebody

296
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:14,332
might find out that 
you're doing this?

297
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:15,672
This isn't you, Ted.

298
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:17,551
It is tonight.

299
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,321
Whoo!

300
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:24,041
You know this girl. 
Where does she live?

301
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:26,752
I'm not telling you that 
for less than 20 bucks.

302
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,062
- Well, I'm out of money.
- I'm cashed, too.

303
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,553
I'll take your purse.

304
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:31,460
My purse?

305
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,722
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.

306
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,873
Okay, fine.

307
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,160
You should tell her that looks 
really good with a chocolate boot.

308
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:44,283
Bitch is lucky I brought 
my small purse.

309
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:46,642
No room for my gun. Here.

310
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,952
Now where does the rodeo slut live?

311
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,443
The building with the green light, 
apartment 3-C.

312
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:53,993
Oh, my God, Robin,

313
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,672
are you going to kick 
this girl's ass?

314
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,070
Yeah...

315
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,320
and steal her purse.

316
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:05,121
I can't believe 
he's cheating on me.

317
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,453
You know how many times 
I could have cheated?

318
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,011
Six... no seven.

319
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:10,593
And you know two of them, 
and they would surprise you.

320
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:13,033
3-C, let's do this. You ready?

321
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:14,573
Should I just kick the door in?

322
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,760
Those are really nice heels 
and you already lost the purse.

323
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:18,693
Let's see if it's unlocked.

324
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:21,441
It's unlocked.

325
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:25,431
Okay, get in there 
and kick some spankable ass.

326
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,203
Robin.

327
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:32,021
- I'm the problem.
- What?

328
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,363
You were right.

329
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:34,750
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

330
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:36,533
I took the nicest guy in the world

331
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:38,311
and I made him a cheater.

332
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,923
Well, don't stand out here 
and beat yourself up.

333
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:42,673
Get in there and beat Ted up.

334
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,010
I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.

335
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:47,211
Actually, I'll take Ted.

336
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:50,203
- Let's do this.
- Bring it.

337
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,552
What do you think you're...?

338
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,490
Barney?

339
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:17,490
Thank God you're here. 
Can you help with this? I need nails.

340
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:21,450
Okay, I'm totally lost here. 
Where's Ted?

341
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:23,333
Ted? He's at work.

342
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:25,232
How did you get here?

343
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,503
Awesome story. As per usual.

344
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,543
How do you think Mr. Brady 
scored a babe like Carol?

345
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,893
Solid point.

346
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:35,810
- And she did have hair of gold.
- Yes, she did.

347
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:37,922
Sorry, I forgot my binocs 
for Foxy Boxing.

348
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:41,170
Whoo, looks like things just got 
a little foxier right here.

349
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:42,840
Yes, they did. 
And you're just in time.

350
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,842
Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you 
in very good, if slightly sullied hands.

351
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:49,843
Don't go. We don't even know your name 
to look out for your buildings.

352
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:51,921
Yeah, stay.

353
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,900
Excuse us for one second.

354
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:58,910
Okay, you were right-- 
the architect thing totally works.

355
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,683
But I've got a girlfriend 
and I've got to get back to work.

356
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,343
This project is getting 
harder and harder.

357
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:06,471
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, had to.

358
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:07,732
See ya.

359
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:12,382
Sorry, my, uh... 
intern had to leave.

360
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:14,272
Oh, well, that's too bad.

361
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,371
I'm Anna, by the way.

362
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:21,290
Ted Mosby... architect.

363
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:25,483
But none of that acclaim means 
anything compared to the joy

364
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:29,043
of  seeing the sun rise 
over your first building.

365
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:33,823
- Dude, dude, what are you doing?
- Galloping.

366
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:38,301
All right, you proved it. The whole 
Ted Mosby, architect thing works.

367
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:40,532
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.

368
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:43,683
Aren't you afraid a certain somebody 
might find out about this?

369
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,731
I mean, this isn't you, Ted.

370
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,773
It is tonight.

371
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,673
And that led to a couple of hours

372
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:54,640
that I cannot, as a gentleman, 
divulge to you.

373
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:57,593
We did it right here, 
and here and here.

374
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:01,692
But why would you use 
Ted's name?

375
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:04,060
I've had some recent bad press 
on the World Wide Web.

376
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,963
So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole 
"using my real name" thing.

377
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:12,352
Oh, this is great. 
It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.

378
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,321
Everything isn't okay.

379
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,691
Look at me. I'm acting crazy 
and jealous and paranoid.

380
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,483
This is how people act 
in relationships.

381
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:24,363
And that's why 
I avoid relationships.

382
00:17:24,947 --> 00:17:26,213
Well, guess what,

383
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:29,433
I haven't been crazy or jealous 
or paranoid in months,

384
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:32,731
and I really miss it.

385
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:35,712
And thus ended this chapter of, 
"Let's pour our hearts out

386
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:38,033
in the bedroom of Barney's 
one-night stand."

387
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:40,012
Come on, let's go before 
she gets out of the shower.

388
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:42,543
You're such a pig. 
You're not even going to say good-bye?

389
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:46,250
I'll have you know 
I composed a lovely form letter

390
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:48,680
for use in just such an occasion.

391
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,843
Just fill out her name and then...

392
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:54,763
Something with a "A."

393
00:17:54,777 --> 00:17:57,430
A... A...

394
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,403
I'll just put "resident."

395
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,691
Go, go, go, go.

396
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:12,780
Robin took a long walk that night.

397
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:15,482
She thought about how opening 
yourself up to another person

398
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:18,840
usually means opening yourself up 
to going a little crazy.

399
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:22,650
She thought about how much easier 
it was just to be alone.

400
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:25,520
And then she came to see me.

401
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:29,991
# And I am nothing of a builder #

402
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,953
# But here I dreamt I was an architect... #
Hey.

403
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,720
Hey.

404
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,691
- What are you doing here?
- I brought donuts.

405
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,483
And I don't want to brag, 
but they're filled with jelly.

406
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:44,451
Thanks.

407
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:49,770
So, uh... how was your night?

408
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:53,030
It was... fine. Nothing exciting.

409
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:55,462
How was yours?

410
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:59,290
You really want to hear about 
boring architect stuff?

411
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,300
Yes, I do.

412
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:04,090
I'm sorry about earlier.

413
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:07,231
To tell you the truth, I never 
even saw all of Field of Dreams.

414
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:09,660
I fell asleep half way through.

415
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:11,870
What? The best part's 
the last 20 minutes.

416
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:14,550
Well, maybe they should have moved that 
part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...

417
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,621
You know what, um...

418
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,580
What I'm trying to say is...

419
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:22,923
I love being the person 
you bitch to.

420
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:28,033
So how was your day, 
Mr. Architect?

421
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,501
Oh, I like the way 
you say that.

422
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,331
Hey, you want to see 
the building

423
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,560
that will make every man 
in Spokane feel inadequate?

424
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,263
Obviously.

425
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:39,960
- Wow.
- Yeah.

426
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,253
You know, you didn't mention 
all the foliage around the base.

427
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,141
If you trim that back, 
the rest would look bigger.

428
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:46,370
You don't have to tell me.

429
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:51,631
And, um... just for fun, I've...

430
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:55,510
I've sort of been working on my own idea 
of what I think the building should be.

431
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:01,801
What do you think?

432
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:06,592
You know that time we went to Spokane 
and I pointed out that skyscraper?

433
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,382
That was the first building 
I ever designed.

434
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:13,902
And that night was the first time 
I showed anyone my first drawing of it.

435
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,920
Wow.

436
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:18,850
Ted, this is amazing.

437
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,782
Thanks.

438
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:24,733
It's not like it will ever 
come to anything.

439
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:26,502
I don't know.

440
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,962
It might come to something.

441
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:34,133
You know, girls find 
architects very hot.

442
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:39,752
Okay,

443
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:44,163
but I don't want you expecting 
78 stories or anything.

444
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,640
"Dear Resident...

445
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:55,573
The time we spent together, 
however long it was,

446
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,441
meant the world to me.

447
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,373
I would love to see you again, 
but unfortunately, I cannot.

448
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,861
You see, I am a ghost.

449
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,781
I can't only materialize 
once every decade

450
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,303
on the anniversary of my death.

451
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:12,452
I chose to spend my one day among 
the living with you,

452
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,511
sweet... Resident.

453
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:17,432
Perhaps we will meet again 
in another decade,

454
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:19,751
provided you keep your figure.

455
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:23,292
Until then, all my love 
from the beyond.

456
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,020
Barney."

457
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,630
Barney?

458
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:31,341
Who the hell is Barney?
