1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:03,997
<i>Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything
was great between me and Robin.</i>

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,542
<i>So we decided to try
and make it even better.</i>

3
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,505
<i>We decided to move in together.</i>

4
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:10,432
So, I can have the moving
truck here by 8:00 am.

5
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:11,822
Does that sound
good to everybody?

6
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:14,907
By the way,
what are you guys doing with Ted's room?

7
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,873
Cause if you need help with the rent,
I'll take it.

8
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:18,678
Why would you want
to live with us?

9
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:21,122
I don't call what
you guys do "living."

10
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:25,460
Here's the deal,
I need a room closer to the bar.

11
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:27,921
It takes me exactly 23 minutes

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,655
to get a girl from the
bar back to my apartment.

13
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:33,299
A lot can go wrong
in 23 minutes.

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,110
This is going to be so hot.

15
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,132
She's paying.

16
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,902
I swear, if he 
doesn't call me back

17
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,322
I'm going to go
through with this.

18
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,510
Please hurry, sir.

19
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,783
I want to do dirty
stuff with you.

20
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,070
Stuff I won't let him do.

21
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:00,481
Every red light run
is an extra $20.

22
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:02,632
Baby?

23
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,721
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
It was all my fault.

24
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,181
I am so drunk.

25
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:15,452
When I'm this drunk,
I go crazy!

26
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,171
I bet you do.

27
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:18,610
Check this out.

28
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,291
What up NYPD?

29
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:26,261
So close.

30
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:30,242
See? If I had a room here all I
have to do is get them upstairs.

31
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:32,233
Come on, guys. It'll be great!

32
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:34,292
We'll come in after
you guys are asleep

33
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:36,060
and I'll be gone
before you wake up.

34
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:39,922
So, you get to have sex and we get to
wake some skanky girl up in the morning

35
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,390
and kick her out?

36
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:42,621
God, Lily.

37
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:45,433
Some guy just told her that he loved
her then pretended to go to the bathroom

38
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:47,883
and never came back
you can't make her a cup of coffee?

39
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,262
Real nice.

40

43
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:08,382
I put all your heavy jackets
in this box marked "winter."

44
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:13,101
And all your colorful sweaters
in this box marked "Bill Cosby."

45
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:16,531
Make fun,
but America loved that guy for a reason.

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,780
Wow!

47
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:20,122
Almost done.

48
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,523
Not so fast.

49
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,392
Take your sword.

50
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:28,082
Wow.

51
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,072
- End of an era.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:33,380
It's a bummer to break up the set,
but you're going to need that sword.

53
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:36,491
It's true--
my building is infested with dragons.

54
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,390
Looks like our little boy
is finally moving out.

55
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:44,932
It seems like just yesterday
he was a cute little freshmen.

56
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:47,963
Discovering Reggae
and ultimate Frisbee.

57
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:50,452
He did it later than the other
kids but we never pushed him.

58
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,993
We knew he'd get there.

59
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:54,321
You haven't moved in yet,
have you?

60
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,003
Good. You guys have
to take this quiz.

61
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,380
I found it in a magazine.

62
00:02:57,438 --> 00:03:00,390
It's called the "Are you ready
to move in together?" quiz.

63
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:03,381
Well, if it's anything like you're
"Are you wearing panties" quiz,

64
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,723
I'm out.

65
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,571
Question one,

66
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:09,650
Ted, "Do you want to
move in with Robin?"

67
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:10,581
Mm. Yes.

68
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:12,343
Oh, you got the
first one wrong.

69
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:15,400
The answer is "no," you
secretly want to be single

70
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,640
and hang out with your
awesome friend Barney."

71
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,022
Question two.

72
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:23,141
Robin, "Do you think you can
score a hotter guy than Ted?"

73
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:27,220
Correct. The answer
was awkward silence.

74
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:32,963
Question three, "Did I just make
up this quiz to prove a point?"

75
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,080
Yes.

76
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:35,672
Yes, I did.

77
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:40,383
Really? You mean it's not from
Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?

78
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,303
So? We all agree?

79
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,782
We move Ted's
stuff back up here?

80
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:46,830
Mm... no.
We're still moving in together.

81
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:49,203
Why? This is crazy.

82
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:51,782
Ted you're throwing your life away.
This girl is blinding you.

83
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:54,883
With her shiny hair and
her boobed shaped boobs.

84
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,401
This is bad for you,
too, you know.

85
00:03:57,457 --> 00:04:00,572
How are you going to feel when
he sees you without any makeup?

86
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:02,913
I'm not wearing
makeup right now.

87
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,283
Holy crap, you're beautiful.

88
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:10,482
All right then, how will you feel when
you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?

89
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:13,202
Oh, come on, Robin doesn't smoke.

90
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:14,731
Wait, do you?

91
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,473
Of course not. Why?

92
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:18,530
Don't tell me how
to live my life!

93
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:22,213
Ted, I can't let you do this.

94
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,523
Come on. This is happening.

95
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:26,300
So instead of fighting it why,
why don't you just help?

96
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,533
- You want me to help you?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,702
Okay, Ted.

98
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,853
I'll help you.

99
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,510
Can't believe we actually
got him to take a box down.

100
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,683
Maybe he's finally
getting on board.

101
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,351
Where's the truck?

102
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:45,813
Where's Barney?

103
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,621
Wait for it.

104
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,892
I can't believe this! Everything
I own in the world is in there.

105
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:54,830
Except for this
box of pot lids.

106
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,420
And the sword.

107
00:04:56,866 --> 00:05:00,292
I'm going to kill him.
I swear to God I'm going to kill him!

108
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:03,141
Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that.
For now.

109
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:11,242
Marshall, we live alone.

110
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,692
This is so great!

111
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:18,561
We can finally do all the things we always
said we wanted to do if we lived alone.

112
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,110
Oh, I know what I
want to start with.

113
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:28,841
So, here we are, right?

114
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,102
Sitting around the
apartment naked.

115
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:35,041
- Awesome.
- Yep.

116
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:41,352
It's not as awesome as
I thought it would be.

117
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,612
- My butt itches.
- I'm cold.

118
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:44,961
I noticed.

119
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,190
Yeah, like you're
one to talk, Pointy.

120
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,803
Barney, I don't know if you
got my other 47 messages,

121
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,632
but if my stuff isn't here within
the hour I'm calling the cops.

122
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,752
This is the last time
I'm calling you.

123
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,372
Because my charger's in
the back of the truck.

124
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:04,210
Don't worry, it's Barney.
He'll bring the stuff back.

125
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:07,773
No, it's just... I was really looking
forward to settling in, you know?

126
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,462
Maybe setting up my TV.

127
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:11,493
Watching a movie in bed.

128
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:13,970
What?

129
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,711
Do we really want a
TV in the bedroom?

130
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:18,622
I thought we did.

131
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,261
I'm not sure that we do.

132
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:22,663
Well, where else
would we put my TV?

133
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:26,261
We could just put it in our
storage unit in the basement.

134
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,621
But wouldn't we miss my TV?

135
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:30,871
- Would we?
- Yes, we would.

136
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,593
We've had that TV
for a long time

137
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:37,722
and we would feel more at home
if it were setup in our bedroom.

138
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,753
- We need wine, don't we?
- Yes, we do.

139
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:51,823
Should we, um,
move this to the bedroom?

140
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,061
Why?

141
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:55,131
Ted doesn't live here anymore.

142
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:57,630
We can do it wherever we want.

143
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,361
You know what else?

144
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,450
We don't have to
be quiet anymore.

145
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,821
We can be as loud as we want.

146
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,905
Okay, I think we need to
lay down some ground rules.

147
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:13,979
Just because we can be loud
doesn't mean we have to be loud.

148
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,511
And although it
might turn you on,

149
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,840
you screaming, "I'm the best," 
doesn't do much for me.

150
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:24,920
Well, it's a lot better than yelling,
"Ted's not here," over and over again.

151
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,533
Well, at least what
I said is true.

152
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:31,082
Well, that was unnecessary.

153
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,880
Well, since I only have one box I
figure I might as well unpack it.

154
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:38,181
Mm, where do you think
we should put it?

155
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:41,211
Well, unless you have a separate pot
lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.

156
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,330
What?

157
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,553
Uh, the thing is my
kitchen is kind of small.

158
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:47,963
And, um,
I already have a bunch of pot lids

159
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:50,912
and mine come with pots, so...

160
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:54,090
You're saying there's no way to make
room for the single box of stuff

161
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:55,733
I try to move into our place?

162
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,540
Well, why don't you just
take it down to the...

163
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,241
Do not say storage space.

164
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,640
I was going to say dumpster.

165
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,792
Damn it, Robin,
this is all I have left in the world--

166
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:06,360
eight pot lids and a sword.

167
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,021
Yeah, about the sword.

168
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:14,521
Hello.

169
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,711
Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.

170
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:19,243
Barney, I know it's you.
Where's my stuff?

171
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:20,463
It's not me.

172
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,602
If you want to see your
precious possessions again,

173
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,183
put on the suit.

174
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,092
What suit?

175
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:28,551
Ding-dong. Oh, what's that?
The doorbell.

176
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,841
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

177
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:32,992
I haven't gotten
to the door yet.

178
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,733
Oh, okay,
let me know when you get there.

179
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,822
Okay, I opened it.
And there's a suit there.

180
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,981
That's the suit
I'm talking about.

181
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:43,011
- Barney ....
- This isn't Barney.

182
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,983
But I hear that guy's awesome.

183
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:48,041
All right.
Listen very carefully.

184
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:52,121
You will get your stuff back if you are
able to complete a series of challenges.

185
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:54,691
Number one, put on the suit.

186
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,531
Number two,
meet me at McClaren's in an hour.

187
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:00,812
How will I know who to look
for since we've never met?

188
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:05,583
I look like Barney.

189
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,612
Oh, Hey, Ted.

190
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,633
Suit and sneakers.

191
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,102
A little Ellen DeGeneres
but you pull it off.

192
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,340
I don't have any other shoes
because you stole them along

193
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,200
with everything else
I own in the world.

194
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:23,700
Where's the truck, Barney?

195
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:25,072
Barney.

196
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:28,581
People's whose trucks I'm not
holding for ransom call me Barney.

197
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:31,850
I think you should
call me The Commodore.

198
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:35,622
- I'm not calling you...
- You're not getting your stuff back.

199
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:38,671
Can I please have
my stuff back...

200
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,460
The Commodore?

201
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,663
No.

202
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:44,430
Here's the deal,
Ted, you're my bro.

203
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:47,883
And you're about to become a henpecked,
beaten down, shell of a man.

204
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:54,083
So tonight, we are going to have one
last awesome night together as bros.

205
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,121
It's a bro-ing away party.

206
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:58,302
A special bro-casion.

207
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:00,100
A bro-choice rally.

208
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,901
Bro-time at the Apollo.

209
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,361
Oh, bro me.

210
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:06,171
Well, so what do I have to do?

211
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:09,551
No, it's not what you have to do,
it's what you want to do,

212
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:11,193
and you want to
have a good time

213
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:14,341
before you go take Fun Ted
out back and shoot him.

214
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,873
So... first thing
on the docket...

215
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,801
- get me that girl's number.
- Absolutely not.

216
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,280
Mm. That's too bad.

217
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:24,201
Hey, hypothetical question:
if I was all your stuff,

218
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,760
would I rather be at the bottom
of the East River or The Hudson?

219
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,531
Hey, look,
world's strongest man is on.

220
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:36,703
Ooh, it's the one where
Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus

221
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:38,643
from the Partridge
family with his teeth.

222
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:41,143
It's the best one.
Hey, Ted, get in...

223
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:48,983
- We live alone.
- Yay.

224
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:52,953
Well, I win.

225
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,012
You need to give my
friend your phone number.

226
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,711
Wow, I really didn't think Lou
Ferrigno could pull that bus.

227
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,522
Are you sure this is live?
It looks pretty old.

228
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:04,252
Yeah, that's 'cause the,
uh, TV is old.

229
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,012
So, I'll, uh,
call you tomorrow?

230
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:12,092
Yeah. Um, not too early.
I have church.

231
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,861
You were impressive, buddy.

232
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,733
Nice work.
All right, next challenge.

233
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:21,531
No. No next challenge. Look, this is
my first night living with Robin.

234
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,872
She's probably pissed I'm
spending it out with you.

235
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,473
This might be our last hurrah,
my little friend.

236
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:34,262
Marshall, I am gonna cook you
the best dinner of your life.

237
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:36,513
How would you like a...

238
00:11:38,646 --> 00:11:42,361
one-egg omelet with
some ketchup and film?

239
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,482
Guess Ted's the one
who did the shopping.

240
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,591
Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!

241
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:54,131
Guess the microwave
was Ted's, too.

242
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:55,393
Yeah.

243
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,420
So were all the towels.

244
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:00,900
Turns out that everything that was
useful in this apartment was Ted's.

245
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:04,922
Everything that was a Foghat poster we
bought ironically in college was mine.

246
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:06,911
Marshall.

247
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,313
Yeah, Baby?

248
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:10,113
Ich miss Ted.

249
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,650
Is it too soon to call him?

250
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:14,121
No, we shouldn't.

251
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:17,281
I don't want to interrupt his
first night living with Robin.

252
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,362
Ha, nice shooting.

253
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:23,933
You know, if we win this one it's free onion
rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.

254
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:24,950
What a bargain.

255
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,891
We only had to spend
20 bucks a game.

256
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,752
Admit it, you're having fun.

257
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:29,973
Maybe.

258
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:33,142
I mean, it was pretty funny when that
little girl fell over that space barrel.

259
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:38,321
Nice... We win.

260
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:42,561
Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--
what up?

261
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,383
Okay. Let's go one more.

262
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:46,842
- I don't know.
- You know you want to.

263
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:49,661
All right, let's do it--
I just got to call Robin real quick.

264
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:52,412
Oh, so that's what it's
gonna be like from now on?

265
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:56,670
No. Okay, okay. You call your old
lady and ask permission to have fun.

266
00:12:56,728 --> 00:13:01,582
Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating
our victory onion rings Han style.

267
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:03,263
Solo.

268
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,040
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, sweetie listen,

269
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:13,500
I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be
pretty late, so don't wait up.

270
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,852
Oh, it's totally fine.
You do what you got to do.

271
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:18,343
Thanks. You're the best.
I love you.

272
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,180
I love you, too. Bye.

273
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:23,613
Hey, sorry about that.
Thanks for holding.

274
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,130
Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel
my subscription to Guns and Ammo,

275
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,400
that would be great.

276
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:31,313
No, it's a great magazine.
Really great.

277
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,132
They've printed
three of my letters.

278
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:34,781
It's just that my
boyfriend is moving in

279
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:37,520
and he kind of doesn't approve
of the whole gun thing.

280
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:41,623
A free hand grenade phone?

281
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:44,912
You know what?
Let me give you my work address.

282
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:48,842
I did it, Baby!

283
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,813
I got beer. I got food.

284
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:53,703
We don't need Ted anymore.

285
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,913
I am the provider of|this apartment now,

286
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,652
and I have provided!

287
00:13:57,707 --> 00:13:59,850
"Provode "? Provided.

288
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,852
Anyway, I got us
everything we need.

289
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:04,791
Could you toss me
the toilet paper?

290
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,570
Be right back, baby. Sit tight.

291
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,592
Hey, I got to admit, um...
I didn't think I would, but, uh...

292
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,563
I had a really
good time tonight.

293
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:20,752
You're a good friend, Barney.

294
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,890
Hey, man, why don't you, uh...

295
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,363
why don't you tell me
where my truck is.

296
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,303
No, I don't think so.

297
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:31,950
Where's my Truck?

298
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,822
Do you know why I haven't given you
any of your possessions back yet?

299
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:39,762
Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk
of the British Royal Douchery?

300
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,373
Because you don't
want them back.

301
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:45,091
You could've left at any time tonight,
but you didn't, Ted.

302
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,121
Why is that?

303
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,432
Because I didn't want to go back
to Robin's without my stuff.

304
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,673
False. You know what I think?

305
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:54,003
I think you spent one day with
her and it already sucked.

306
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:56,670
I think you didn't like being there,
she didn't like having you there

307
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:59,731
and you both realized that
you made a huge mistake.

308
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:02,880
And that's why you spent your
first night living with Robin

309
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,531
out playing laser tag with me.

310
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:06,853
And that's why
three seconds ago

311
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,502
you didn't call it "my place"
or "our place" or "home,"

312
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:12,492
You called it "Robin's".

313
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,712
You know what?

314
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,513
You can keep my stuff.

315
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:24,011
- Hey.
- Hey, did you get the truck back?

316
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,080
No.

317
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,601
Why not? What happened?

318
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:29,862
Oh, he pissed me off so much,
I left.

319
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:33,662
Anyway, I just wanted to come back here,
space out and watch a movie.

320
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:37,442
Do you anything that
wasn't made by John Woo?

321
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:39,403
Why, do you?

322
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:43,290
You know, forget the movie.
I just want to sit.

323
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:48,582
What?

324
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:51,010
It's just I eat at that table.

325
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:53,452
Fine, I'll take my shoes off.

326
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:55,552
You know, why don't you just
throw me down in the storage space

327
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:56,753
where you have room for me.

328
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,600
- Ted, come on.
- Nein, you come on.

329
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,830
I had to jump through
hoops all night for Barney

330
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,652
and then it took me an hour
to get home because his place

331
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,573
is so far away from the bar.

332
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:07,092
- Oh, my God.
- What?

333
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:09,552
I know where Barney
put my truck.

334
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,473
Let's go back to my place.

335
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:18,390
I bet you my place is closer.

336
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,302
Here we are.

337
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,843
You live in the loading
dock behind the bar?

338
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:27,952
I don't live here, baby.
This is just my ride.

339
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,492
No, no, no, no.
I'm not getting into any van,

340
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,492
I've seen Silence of the Lambs.

341
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,611
Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne
in the back of a moving van.

342
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,902
Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.

343
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,032
Those other Rockettes who
called you slow are crazy.

344
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:09,640
Oh, my God. I knew it.
You're kidnapping me.

345
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,321
- Help! Help!
- No, no, no, no.

346
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,830
I can explain.

347
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:19,551
Hello?

348
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,560
Enjoying the ride?

349
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:24,782
Ted? Ted, you let us out of here.
You let us out of here this instant!

350
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,383
This isn't Ted.

351
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:28,900
But I hear that guy's awesome.

352
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:38,752
So I took Sara home and I took
Barney to a bar near his apartment.

353
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:41,171
Apparently, that strategy
had never occurred to him.

354
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,543
That poor girl must've
been so confused.

355
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,632
Yeah.

356
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,283
Well, at least Barney
learned a valuable lesson.

357
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,700
You do not want to get scissor
kicked in the groin by a Rockette.

358
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:57,331
So, uh,
I guess we should get you unpacked.

359
00:17:57,386 --> 00:17:58,603
Yeah.

360
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:00,611
Yeah, I guess we should.

361
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:06,523
Lily... deep within the
Amazonian rainforest,

362
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:10,453
there is a type of tree that only grows
around the body of an existing tree.

363
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:13,613
It cannot survive
without this tree.

364
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,831
It is supported...

365
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,460
by this tree.

366
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,601
Lily, we are that tree.

367
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,550
- The inside tree or the outside tree?
- The outside tree.

368
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:25,862
- Shouldn't there be three trees?
- You and I are one tree.

369
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,303
Okay, look, Lily,
the point is that we grew around Ted

370
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:31,642
and without him,
we're slowly dying.

371
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:34,451
What do we do?

372
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,000
I think we can
marry each other.

373
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,321
But we also have to marry Ted.

374
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:46,711
I'll tell you right now, my Dad is
not gonna pay for that wedding.

375
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:48,733
Ted!

376
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:50,400
What are you doing here?

377
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,472
Robin and I aren't gonna
move in together after all.

378
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:55,001
What happened?

379
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:58,233
I thought we decided
we were ready?

380
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,682
I know.

381
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:01,633
How did we come to that again?

382
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:04,923
I don't remember.
We were fighting?

383
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,160
- It's all so blurry.
- Yeah.

384
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,942
The "let's move in together"
sex was pretty amazing.

385
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:10,961
I know.

386
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:14,153
I did that thing with no hands
I normally need both to do.

387
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:19,490
You know...
I'm really happy with you.

388
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:22,380
I really happy with you.
The way things are.

389
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,193
Maybe we shouldn't
mess with that.

390
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,991
I don't know that we should.

391
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:35,601
Hey... I hear the "let's not move in
together" sex is pretty incredible.

392
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:38,481
Let's go back to my place.

393
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:51,362
- Ooh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

394
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:53,243
- No, thank you.
- You'll be very happy.

395
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:59,773
Look, I know you guys are really excited
about having the place to yourself.

396
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:03,703
Until after the wedding, I mean,
if it's not too much of an imposition...

397
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:11,053
God, this feels so right.

398
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:13,302
Never leave us again.

399
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:18,901
Guys, Robin's down in the truck and
there's actually a lot of boxes,

400
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,392
so maybe we should...

401
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,351
Do we have time for this?

402
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:30,082
Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my
hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.

403
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:33,480
The category: top ten things
I would've called my truck...

404
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,373
It was never your truck.

405
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:37,022
...if Ted hadn't been a
jerk and given it back.

406
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:38,103
It was a rental.

407
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:41,041
Number ten, "The Winne-Bango".

408
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,352
Number nine,
"The Pick-Up Truck".

409
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:47,642
Number eight,
"The Ford Explore Her".

410
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:51,840
Number seven,
"The You Scream Truck."

411
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,581
You Scream.

412
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:58,783
Number six,
"Feels On Wheels." Hello!

413
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:01,932
Number five,
"The Ride Her Truck."

414
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:04,810
Number four, "The 18-Squeeler".

415
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:08,632
Number three, "The Esca-Laid".

416
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:14,552
Number two, "The Slam-Boney".

417
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,332
and... the number one thing
I would've called my truck

418
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:19,631
if Ted hadn't been a jerk
and given it back...

419
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:22,181
"The '69 Chevy."

420
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:27,831
Sorry.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
