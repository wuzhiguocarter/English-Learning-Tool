1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,000
???

2
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:02,717
<i>had been together</i>

3
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:04,267
<i>for nine wonderful years,</i>

4
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,967
<i>until she dumped him</i>
<i>and ran off to San Francisco.</i>

5
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:10,267
<i>The healing process</i>
<i>was taking a long time.</i>

6
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,934
(groans)

7
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,500
Then, one night,
he made a giant leap forward.

8
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,068
All right, I'll
see you guys later.

9
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:17,367
I'll walk you out.

10
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,600
MARSHALL:
See ya.

11
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,534
You just checked out
Robin's ass.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,001
What? No!
N-No, Barney, I was...

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,834
Dude, that's awesome.

14
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:30,233
You're finally
forgetting

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,934
-about that short redhead.
-Lily.

16
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,200
Yes, Lily. Thank you.

17
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,001
That was going to drive me
crazy all night.

18
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:38,534
Hey, Ted, Marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,934
-I did not, Ted, I...
-That's awesome.

20
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,300
You're finally
getting better.

21
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,168
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

22
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:47,267
Starting tonight, I am going
to teach you how to live.

23
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,434
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; Marshall's in.

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,534
-Yes!
-Oh, God.

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,734
Marshall, being a single guy
in New York City is like...

26
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,034
-What's something everybody likes?
-Candy.

27
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,867
Yes, it's like being
in a candy store.

28
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:03,934
You just walk right in
and grab yourself some Whoppers.

29
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:05,467
(groans)
Yeah.

30
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,134
Is Whoppers the best one?

31
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Mounds.

32
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,367
Milk Duds.

33
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,068
Gobstoppers.

34
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:16,784
<i>This went on for another hour;</i>
<i>I'll just skip to the end.</i>

35
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:18,200
-Dubble Bubbles.
-Nice!

36
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,634
Marshall.

37
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,801
We're doing this.

38
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,467
I am not taking no
for an answer.

39
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:24,667
-Fine.
(chuckles)
-Hey, Robin.

40
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:25,734
Marshall checked out your ass.

41
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:27,634
Ted, what is wrong with you?

42
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,234
He checked out my ass.

43
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,433
Hey, tell him thanks.

44
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,567
I felt like I was having
a bad ass day.

45
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,034
Cool, see ya.

46
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:38,667
Lily.

47
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:41,901
It <i>is</i> a great ass.

<i>in three months.</i>

52
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,884
<i>There were so many</i>

53
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:01,084
<i>so many things to say.</i>

54
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,384
Your hair is adorable.

55
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,500
(both giggling)

56
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:09,034
<i>Meanwhile, Barney was taking</i>
<i>Marshall out to meet women</i>

57
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:11,201
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>since he was 17.</i>

58
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:12,300
Just wing it.
Come on.

59
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,268
Hi. Have you
met Marshall?

60
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,067
-Hi.
-Hi.

61
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:20,567
Look how sweaty my hands are.

62
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,867
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?

63
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:27,934
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.

64
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:30,934
Eww.
It was nice meeting you.

65
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,134
I-I-I hate to
interrupt, but, uh,

66
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,168
do you like magic?

67
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:37,834
Um, I guess.

68
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,067
(gasps)

69
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,367
Oh, my God!

70
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,901
(laughing)

71
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,300
Anyway, Marshall
here is awesome.

72
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,400
Salad in a bag? His idea.

73
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,400
<i>Dude!</i>

74
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,901
You were awesome last night.

75
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,300
You were charming,

76
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,967
you were funny, you were totally
working that girl.

77
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,168
You went home with her.

78
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:00,801
Yes, I did.

79
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:02,567
But she told me

80
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:05,967
that if it wasn't for me, you
would have had a shot with her,

81
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,834
so, in hypothetical terms,
you scored last night.

82
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,300
All right!

83
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:12,168
Hypothetical high five.

84
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:15,001
Nice.

85
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,367
All right. Tonight, we're going
to go to the bar...

86
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,333
Barney, no, I am not going
out with you ever again.

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,767
-Come on! I'll, I'll teach you
all of my strategies.
-Oh, really?

88
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:25,534
My favorite, number seven:

89
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,667
create a mystery about yourself.

90
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,201
That way,
they become so intrigued,

91
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,433
they <i>have</i> to hang out
with you all night.

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,067
Oh, come on, does
that really work?

93
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:36,734
Maybe it does,
and maybe it doesn't.

94
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:40,268
Damn it, that's intriguing.

95
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,333
Okay, I'm in.

96
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:47,234
I have something you've
got to hear.
You will not
believe what just happened.

97
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,034
You go first.

98
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:51,867
I found a 1939 penny
on the subway.

99
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,034
Just imagine
the kind of history

100
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,367
this little copper guy...

101
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,767
Lily's back in town.

102
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:00,700
And you let me go first?
Have you seen her?

103
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,433
Uh, yeah. I actually went

104
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,034
apartment-hunting
with her today.

105
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,467
How's she doing?

106
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:06,934
You're not going to like it.

107
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,600
I am doing great.

108
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,967
This summer,
best thing ever!

109
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:14,667
San Francisco is so
happening right now.

110
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,034
She's happy?!

111
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:18,101
Marshall had the worst
summer of his life,

112
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:20,634
and she's happy.

113
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,333
Yeah, and I suppose
her art program

114
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,268
was all fulfilling or whatever.

115
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,734
Oh. The art program--
best thing ever.

116
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,634
Oh, my God.

117
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,467
This is your best work.

118
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,234
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,734
anything so...

120
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,667
Needless to say,
this is art.

121
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:39,834
(chuckles)

122
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,467
I can't teach you anything.

123
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:44,567
(gasps)

124
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,168
(chuckles)

125
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:48,001
But the best part of S.F.--

126
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,168
Oh, that's what

127
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:51,767
we call San Francisco--
the people.

128
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,168
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.

129
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:57,268
It was like a human tapestry.

130
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,834
Hi, I'm Mike.

131
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:02,367
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.

132
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:05,634
I'm Paula. I sing in a
punk band for children.

133
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,134
Yeah.

134
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,834
I'm Dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.

135
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,700
You are stunning, by the way.

136
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,934
Wow. I'm so happy for you.

137
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:18,967
Oh, she's such a...

138
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:21,500
After what she did to Marshall,

139
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,001
she should come back here
devastated,

140
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,801
crawling on all fours
over the broken glass

141
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,234
of her own shame and regret.

142
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,967
You never chose sides.
I respect that.

143
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:31,300
She's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

144
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:34,134
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?

145
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,333
Oh. Listen, Marshall.

146
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,867
Ted found a penny
on the subway,

147
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:40,967
and it's old, and
that's interesting.

148
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:43,101
Way to go.

149
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,901
Okay, first of all,
that <i>is</i> interesting.

150
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,834
Second, we have
to tell him.

151
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,467
No, we don't.

152
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,400
He's just starting to get
better, going out with Barney.

153
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,467
I mean, how do you think
he's going to feel

154
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:57,901
when he hears
Lily's moved on?

155
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,400
She's moved on?

156
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,268
It happens.
I've fallen out of love

157
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,500
faster than that before,

158
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,268
sometimes, boom, with
no warning whatsoever.

159
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,600
One day we're in love,
the next day, he's dead to me.

160
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:12,901
But we're great. Honey.

161
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,268
Now, let's review
Barney's rules for
mating without dating.

162
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,700
Lesson two, corollary five.

163
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:24,234
Make a beautiful woman feel
self-conscious and unattractive,

164
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,667
and she'll be
putty in your hands.

165
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:26,667
Excellent.

166
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,333
Have you chosen your entree?

167
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,234
I have. Sweet brunette,
eight o'clock.

168
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,667
Nine o'clock. Ten... thirty.

169
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:34,400
She's walking to the bar.

170
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,268
Her? Really?

171
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,268
Yeah.

172
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,667
No, you're right.

173
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,667
Ambition is the enemy
of success.

174
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,901
Okay. Hit it.

175
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:46,367
(smacks lips)

176
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:47,500
What's the matter, four eyes,

177
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,867
you got astigmatism
or something?

178
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,367
I'm sorry, I was trying
to playfully disarm you,

179
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,134
but I just got out
of a long relationship.

180
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:54,734
I have no idea
what I'm doing.

181
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,467
I'm Marshall.

182
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:58,400
Hi, Marshall. Amy.

183
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,201
Don't worry. I've been there.

184
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,534
Hold on.

185
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,268
Nice recovery.
I think it's working.

186
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,268
Um, Amy.

187
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:06,801
This is my friend, Barney.

188
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,467
Barney, this is Amy.

189
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:09,634
Hi, Barney.

190
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,268
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

191
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:16,333
Amy, do you like... magic?

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,300
-I hate you.
-I am so sorry.

193
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:20,433
It's a sickness.

194
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,234
I'm the real victim here.

195
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,634
Twice.

196
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,767
Twice in a row,
you took my candy.

197
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:27,300
That was my candy.

198
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:28,667
I know, but tonight...

199
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:29,667
No.

200
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:30,667
Forget it.

201
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,700
You're such a jackass.

202
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:37,001
I thought you were gonna
call me a jerk.

203
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,867
All right, I'm sorry.

204
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:41,967
I will make it up to you.

205
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:43,400
Tonight, we'll go
to a college bar

206
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,934
near NYU--
The Scorpion and the Toad.

207
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:47,001
I figure

208
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,234
in a younger crowd

209
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,667
you'll seem more mature,
more worldly

210
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:53,333
and, as a third-year
law student, more smarter.

211
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,400
Okay, but no magic.

212
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,467
How did you do that?

213
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,567
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.

214
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:09,268
<i>Robin and I met Lily</i>

215
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,934
<i>outside the next apartment</i>
<i>she was seeing.</i>

216
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,700
But I need the freedom
to really chase my passion,

217
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:14,867
which <i>was</i> painting,

218
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:16,134
but now I think
it's music

219
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:17,934
or spoken word-- maybe both.

220
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,801
God! Isn't life amazing?

221
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,001
It is so great
to see you, Ted.

222
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,201
I'm going to get the key
from the lockbox.

223
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,384
What?

224
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:28,850
She's miserable.

225
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,317
She's realized she's
made a huge mistake.

226
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,151
Her and Marshall will be back
together in a week.

227
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:33,684
-I love it!
-Um, no. You just

228
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,767
want Lily to be miserable.

229
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,153
The truth is, she's happy.

230
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,054
Trust me. I've known
Lily for nine years.

231
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,420
Trust <i>me.</i> I'm a girl.

232
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:40,787
Yeah, but you're Canadian.
Why do you always

233
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,153
have to bring that up?

234
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,887
You're our weird
neighbors to the north.

235
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,587
You bring it up every time.
All right,
five bucks says

236
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:45,943
she still wants Marshall.

237
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,878
You're on.

238
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:50,110
-Five American bucks.
-Damn it.

239
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,910
Okay, so how do we get

240
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:53,077
the truth out of her.

241
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,144
Tequila. It's
her weakness.

242
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,010
Three shots, she'll tell you
the truth about anything.

243
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,277
I hope this is my new home.

244
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,893
Yeah, I'm going to take
that <i>first</i> apartment.

245
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,661
(knocking)

246
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,728
Marshall Eriksen, suit up!

247
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:08,561
-No way.
-Yeah, you're good in that.

248
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:09,828
Let's go.

249
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:11,160
(clears throat)
Wait.

250
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:12,494
Empty your pockets.

251
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,594
Come on.

252
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,194
Come on, let's...

253
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,294
(clears throat)
Sleeves.

254
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,327
There is nothing in my...

255
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:31,661
Oh, is that right?

256
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:32,860
Uh-huh.

257
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,494
Let's go.
(clears throat)

258
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,494
Behind my ear.

259
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:38,294
There is nothing behind your...

260
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:39,993
BOTH:
Oh.

261
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:42,760
WOMAN:
<i>Yeah, I'm in pre-law.</i>

262
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,034
The workload's
killing me, though.

263
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,301
Oh, tell me about it.

264
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,001
I'm third year
at Columbia Law, so...

265
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,401
Hmm.
if the workload

266
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:49,934
does kill you, I can
probably get a conviction.

267
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,167
(both laughing)

268
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,533
Yeah.

269
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,368
You must be majoring in
chemistry,

270
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:58,867
'cause what I'm picking
up between us is, uh...

271
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,800
College lesbian phase.

272
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:07,034
Listen, I got to go,

273
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,368
but it'd be great
to see you again.

274
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:11,368
Yes, it would.

275
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,001
It really would.

276
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,034
Well, maybe I'll
see you here sometime.

277
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:19,834
Probably not.
I'm never here, so...

278
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,633
You know, I do have
a phone number.

279
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,201
Great. Nice.

280
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,001
Hi, I'm Barney.

281
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,067
Oh, no.

282
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:29,800
Do you...

283
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,700
mind giving my friend
your phone number?

284
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:32,967
Sure.

285
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,867
Whoo!

286
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,368
I did it! I got
a girl's phone number.

287
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,633
Oh, and her handwriting
is so cute, look.

288
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,800
Oh, I'm gonna take
her out for Chinese food

289
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,600
and then maybe we'll
walk through the park.

290
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,001
It'll be so... what?

291
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:49,867
Sorry, buddy, I'm
taking this one, too.

292
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:56,834
I'll kill you!

293
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,401
And then, I discovered
this area, North Beach.

294
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:00,834
Best beach ever!

295
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,234
Oh, I've been

296
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:04,700
blabbering on about my summer.

297
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,834
How are you guys doing?

298
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,167
And hey, how's Marshall?

299
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,767
Give me the card!
I'm not giving you any card.

300
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,500
I swear...!
You are not getting...!

301
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,500
Terrific.

302
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:13,734
That is so good to hear.

303
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,767
(cell phone ringing)

304
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:15,967
Oh, hold on.

305
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,700
This could be
about the apartment.

306
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,667
(ringing continues)

307
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,767
Okay, we're way past
truth-telling-Lilly

308
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,401
and about to hit
Cinco-de-Mayo-1998-Lilly

309
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:24,867
and I'm <i>not</i> cleaning
that up again.

310
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,401
So, congratulations,
you win.

311
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,034
She's happy.

312
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,800
I didn't get it.

313
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,567
That first apartment, I...

314
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,368
I waited too long and...

315
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,001
somebody else got it.

316
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,468
(crying)

317
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,967
Interesting.

318
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,368
Wow, Lily,
you, uh...

319
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,167
seem to be having a
pretty strong reaction

320
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:49,567
on losing an apartment.

321
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:51,401
I wonder if it's
because it reminds you

322
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:54,067
of something else
you lost because
you couldn't commit.

323
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,001
(continues crying)
No, Lily,

324
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,667
you're crying
over the crown molding

325
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,134
and the real
hardwood floors.

326
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,067
There's no
deeper meaning.

327
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,500
Right, Lily? Just quit
crying and tell him.

328
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,101
(crying continues)

329
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,867
The apartment is a metaphor
for Marshall.

330
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,750
-stop it.
-You don't want to see

331
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:18,417
what I'm like
when I'm angry.

332
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:19,684
Stop! Hold on!

333
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,283
If we can't settle
this like gentlemen,

334
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,383
then no one
gets the number.

335
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,817
(screams)

336
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:25,017
Stop the cab.
Wha...?

337
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,917
(tires screech)

338
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:28,218
No, wait. Come on.

339
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,084
Marshall!
(door closes)

340
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,751
81st and First, please.

341
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:37,350
Ah, she does have
cute handwriting.

342
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,017
TED:
<i>The thing about a hangover</i>

343
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:42,784
<i>is that everyone has their</i>
<i>own special remedy.</i>

344
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:43,884
WAITER:
Morning, guys.

345
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:45,484
What can I get you?
Shh!

346
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,383
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you got.

347
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,084
And a milkshake.

348
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:52,017
For you, sir?

349
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:55,317
Gravy.

350
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,317
You want that gravy
on something?

351
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:59,250
Surprise me.

352
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,984
I'd take you with gravy

353
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:03,484
if my boyfriend wasn't
sitting right here.

354
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,751
Just kidding. I'm good.

355
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,218
What are you so chirpy about?

356
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:11,417
She's still drunk
from last night.

357
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,084
I don't think so.

358
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,450
Whoo!

359
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:19,283
Look, if you want
Marshall back so bad,

360
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,184
how come it took you two
days to even ask about him?

361
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,751
I was dying to ask.

362
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:26,017
I was just trying
to play it cool.

363
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:27,584
But really...

364
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,584
But it's good, I mean,
work is great...

365
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,984
LILY:
<i>Come on, say something</i>
<i>about Marshall.</i>

366
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:32,283
<i>Where's Marshall?</i>
<i>How's Marshall?</i>

367
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,517
<i>What's Marshall</i>
<i>doing right now?</i>

368
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:34,751
<i>Shut up and talk</i>
<i>about Marshall.</i>

369
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:36,084
<i>Shut up</i>
<i>and talk about Marshall.</i>

370
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,584
<i>Shut up and talk</i>
<i>about Marshall.</i>

371
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,084
<i>Marshall, Marshall,</i>
<i>Marshall, Marshall...</i>

372
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,383
<i>I've got to ask!</i>

373
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,417
And hey, how's Marshall?

374
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:44,084
It was such an awful summer.

375
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:46,851
I just wanted to get
back here and see him.

376
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,784
But I thought
your summer was great.

377
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:50,684
Not exactly.

378
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,484
Oh, my God.

379
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,417
This is you best work?

380
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,884
In all my years teaching,

381
00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:00,517
I've never seen anything
so needless.

382
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,250
To say this is... art...

383
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,917
I can't teach you anything.

384
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:13,350
So all those interesting people
you met on the bus?

385
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,417
Yeah, um...

386
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,584
Hi. I'm Mike.

387
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,250
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.

388
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:26,218
(imitating woman):
I'm Paula. I sing
in a punk band for children.

389
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,218
(deep voice):
I'm Dan. I'm
a neurosurgeon.

390
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:32,884
You are stunning,
by the way.

391
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:35,684
I never got in touch
because I was too embarrassed.

392
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,484
I screwed
everything up.

393
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,550
I have no job,
no place to live.

394
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:43,151
I lost the love of my life.

395
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,617
I know I have no right
to ask this,

396
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,184
but do you think Marshall
would take me back?

397
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,884
In a heartbeat.

398
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,283
If you called
him up, yeah,

399
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,484
he'd take you back
with open arms.

400
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,951
Wow. So maybe I should call him.

401
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:00,350
Maybe.

402
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,617
No! This is... Ow!

403
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,118
Hold on.

404
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:06,717
Look, if you're going
to go back to him,

405
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:08,484
I don't want to hear
the word "maybe."

406
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,283
"Maybe" cannot be
in your vocabulary.

407
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,383
This breakup
almost killed him.

408
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,484
And he cannot go through
it again.

409
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,617
So, unless

410
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:17,650
you're absolutely certain,

411
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,051
stay the hell away from him.

412
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:25,584
This guy likes pennies.

413
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,484
Hi, Marshall.

414
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,684
No, go away. I don't
want to talk to you.

415
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:34,417
Okay, I know what I did
a couple nights back

416
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,817
is in a moral
gray area.

417
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:40,317
But the great news is,
she loved you.

418
00:15:40,383 --> 00:15:41,984
If things had
gone your way--

419
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,383
you'd gone out
a couple times,

420
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,484
I think she definitely would
have had sex with you.

421
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,151
There's no "would"
in sex.

422
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:49,417
(both chuckle)

423
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,017
You're right, I totally...

424
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,717
I'm just no good
at this, Barney.

425
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,584
I'm good at being
in a couple,

426
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,017
I'm good at being
Lily's boyfriend.

427
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:58,084
Being single-- forget it.

428
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,751
Come on, you can't
give up now.

429
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,051
What if I told you that
you could relive that night

430
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,584
with the exact same
conversations,

431
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,017
the exact same jokes

432
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:07,784
only this time, you
get her and I don't.

433
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:09,250
That's not possible.

434
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:10,917
Oh, but it is.

435
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:13,684
She has... wait for it...

436
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:15,484
(voice rising):
...here it comes...

437
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,484
(high-pitched):
...almost there...

438
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,784
an identical twin.

439
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,684
Yes!

440
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,118
A twin isn't
the same person.

441
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,450
Of course it is. What do
you think identical means?

442
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,118
"Ident"-- same,
"ical"-- person.
Same person.

443
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:30,250
Hey, we could
double date.

444
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:33,717
Fine.

445
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,617
But you have to promise me,

446
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:38,984
you're not going to steal
my new twin, and leave me

447
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:41,283
with your old, used-up twin.

448
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,550
Used up?

449
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:45,650
They're a human
being, Marshall.

450
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:49,684
<i>So Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>and Uncle Barney</i>

451
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:51,717
<i>went out on a double date</i>
<i>with the twins.</i>

452
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:53,650
How you doing?

453
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:54,917
Great.

454
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:57,118
Amazing.
This is so much fun.

455
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,218
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.

456
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:00,617
You are,
you definitely are.

457
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,184
Listen, you're going
to have to leave now.

458
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,617
I just talked
with the twins, and get this,

459
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:07,283
I'm going home
with both of them.

460
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,417
Yeah. That's happening.

461
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:13,417
It is impossible
that you're doing
this to me again.

462
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,917
But they're twins.

463
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,283
You-- you said to me
that being single

464
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,084
would be like being
in a candy store.

465
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:22,084
Well, it's not, it's not
like a candy store.

466
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:24,784
It's a lawless,
postapocalyptic wasteland.

467
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:27,317
I may be your
best friend...
Actually Ted's my best friend.

468
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:30,650
But in this world, it's
every hombre for himself.

469
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,151
That's what being single is.

470
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,118
And after nine years
in captivity,

471
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,383
that is the single greatest
lesson I can teach you

472
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,650
about surviving in the wild.

473
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,218
Now, if you'll excuse me...

474
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,784
I have two unique breasts

475
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:44,984
and two duplicates
waiting for me.

476
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:49,383
(chuckles)

477
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,283
Oh, bad news-- Marshall got
food poisoning.

478
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,218
What?
Oh, no.

479
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,317
That's too bad.
I really liked him.

480
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:59,717
Yeah. well, I guess
we're just a threesome tonight.

481
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,484
Lily, what are you doing here?

482
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,184
Oh, oh, I was just
walking by. I wasn't...

483
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:19,084
Oh, you mean New York?

484
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:20,151
My program ended.

485
00:18:20,218 --> 00:18:21,917
It was just great.

486
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,417
Just lots of fun...
It was awful.

487
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:26,118
It was the worst mistake
I ever made.

488
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:29,250
I'm so sorry, Marshall,
and... hello.

489
00:18:31,784 --> 00:18:34,250
Lily, this was the
worst summer of my life.

490
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:37,383
I know. It was the worst
summer of my life.

491
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,417
It was the hardest
thing that I've ever
had to go through.

492
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:43,917
Can we please get back together?

493
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:48,051
All that crap you
said to me about,

494
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:51,917
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,

495
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:54,684
and we need to learn
to do things on our own,"

496
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,817
it broke my heart.

497
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:01,917
Three months ago,
you broke my heart.

498
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,383
Can we please
get back together?

499
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:09,484
Lily, you were right.

500
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:15,817
All that crap was right.

501
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:17,684
So, no.

502
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:20,118
No, we can't
get back together.

503
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:22,317
We shouldn't.

504
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:25,218
At least, not right now.

505
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:28,250
Wow.

506
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:32,517
Okay. Yeah.

507
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,250
Well...

508
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:41,118
Will we still see each other?

509
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:43,684
Yeah, yeah.

510
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,017
I think so.

511
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,684
I don't know.

512
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,951
This is all really
new to me.

513
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:55,617
I just got out of
a long relationship.

514
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,984
I like your hair.

515
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:04,084
Thanks.

516
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:08,517
I figured new city,
a different color...

517
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,517
* ...Wide open road *

518
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,917
* It was love to us *

519
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,867
And the pizza there,
worst pizza ever.

520
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:26,634
I'm so glad to be
back in New York.

521
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:31,300
Listen, if there's
anything I can do

522
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,767
to even begin to make
things up to you...

523
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:39,834
Actually there may be something
that you can do for me,

524
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:43,101
but you can never
ever ask me why.

525
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:46,134
So then I was promoted
to assistant m\nage-er...

526
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,834
Manager--
why do I keep doing that?

527
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:51,600
Lily?

528
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,901
You gave me chlamydia,
you jerk.

529
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,901
So where was I?

530
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,034
Ah, yes, assistant m\nage-er...
I did it again.

531
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,400
I can't believe it.

532
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,701
You gave my twin sister
chlamydia.

533
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,634
