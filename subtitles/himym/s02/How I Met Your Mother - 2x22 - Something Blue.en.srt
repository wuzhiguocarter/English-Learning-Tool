1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time ever

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,200
Mr. and Marshall Eriksen
and Lily Aldrin.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,300
Does it make you kind of sad that
we don't share the same last name?

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,200
You know, in a totally evolved
21st-century kind of way,

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,600
yeah, a little.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,500
You know what we should do?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,900
We should come up with
a whole new last name.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,300
Oh, that's easy--
Lily and Marshall Skywalker.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,100
Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,500
I got it. You ready?

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,500
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Lily and Marshall Awesome.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
Have you met the Awesomes?

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,300
Marshall, Lily, their son,
Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,900
I love you, Mr. Awesome.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,800
I love you, Mrs. Awesome.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
- So...
- So...

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,000
Wedding's over.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,400
Yes, it is.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,700
I guess starting tomorrow,

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
we can tell people.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,000
Tell people what?

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,500
Hi, Barney.

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,700
Tell people what?

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,300
The food looks delicious,
doesn't it?

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,500
Tell people what?

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,300
Nothing.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,700
Oh, okay. Tell people what?

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,900
Can we talk about this later?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Absolutely. Tell people what?

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,600
- Hi. Have you met Barney?
- Hey. Barney Stinson.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Lovely dress.
I know, I'm sick of these things, too.

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,100
It's like the same wedding over and
over again. You're totally right.

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,700
You want to dance? Great,
see you out there. Tell people what?

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
Look, this is just not something we want
to talk about right now, okay, Barney?

36
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Okay.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,100
Whoo, that was a close one.

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,900
Think he'll actually let it go?

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,300
Tell people what?
Tell people what? Tell people what?

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
Tell people what?
Tell people...

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,100
There's a black Nissan Stanza in
the parking lot with it's lights on.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,700
Tell people what?
Tell people what?

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,500
Can I get a water please?

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
- Tell people what?
- Oh, God! Okay.

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,700
Look, we have some... news.

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,200
But we don't want to draw attention
away from Lily and Marshall's big day.

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,000
So just forget about it until
they leave for the honeymoon.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,200
Fine.

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
- It's pretty big, though.
- Oh, my God, just tell me!

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,300
- Oh, help us.
- What's wrong?

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,700
We're starving.

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,700
We planned this amazing
meal with the caterers,

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
and we haven't
had a bite of it.

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,600
Every time we get near the food,
we get cocktail weiner blocked.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,300
Marshall!

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
We haven't eaten all day.

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,000
All right,
let's run some interference.

61
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,200
Yeah, we'll get you back to your table.
Come on.

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,700
Oh, there you are.

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,200
My dear, you look so beautiful.

64
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,700
Thanks, Grammie,
but we really need to...

65
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,300
And you...
you look like a 1940s movie star.

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,000
And you look like a pepper-crusted
rack of lamb with mint jelly.

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
All right,
let's get these two back to their table.

68
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,700
We will see you on the floor for
the conga line later, won't we?

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,900
The answer to that one
was decided weeks earlier.

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Conga line.

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, yes, definitely.

72
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
How about a slide show of
you guys through the years

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,900
set to Green Day's
"Time of Your Life"

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,900
and ending with your baby
photos side by side.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,300
Oh, that's great.
Going on the list.

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
What list?

77
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,600
Horrible wedding clichés we're not going
to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.

78
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Oh, like First Corinthians?

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,100
That Bible verse?

80
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
They do that at every wedding.

81
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,400
How's it go?

82
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,000
"Love is patient and kind.

83
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,900
"Love does not envy or boast.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,200
"It is not arrogant or rude.

85
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,400
"Love does not insist
on it's own way.

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,400
"It is not irritable
or resentful.

87
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,200
"Love bears all things,

88
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,500
"believes all things,

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,600
"hopes all things...

90
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,100
"endures all things."

91
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
- Lame.
- Going on the list.

92
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,900
We've done it.
A wedding with zero clichés.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Wait, isn't doing it in the reception
hall bathroom kind of a cliché?

94
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,800
Well, okay, one cliché.

95
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Well, technically two.

96
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,600
No! They cleared
our plates again!

97
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,000
Pepper-crusted rack of lamb,
where did you go?!

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,700
It's my wedding night.
I was supposed to have my way with you.

99
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, you still have me.

100
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,200
Yeah...

101
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,700
Anyway, guys, we're kind of
in the middle of something,

102
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,700
so if you could go bicker or
share a tense, sexless silence

103
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
or whatever married people do
somewhere else, that'd be great.

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,900
No, Barney, this is my wedding,

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,700
and I will sit wherever
I damn well...

106
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Are those mini quiches?

107
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,100
Tell the secret.

108
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
Okay, uh...

109
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
it was our anniversary,

110
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
so we went to this
restaurant Carmichael's,

111
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,300
which is where we went
on our first date.

112
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,100
Remember, the place where I stole
the blue French horn for Robin?

113
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,100
Oh, right, that was you.

114
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
I knew that was
somebody I knew.

115
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,900
What?

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,100
Dude, you were there.

117
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,600
That was like a big iconic
moment in all of our lives.

118
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,100
Maybe in your life--
I got a lot of stuff going on.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,300
Okay, so we're sitting there
and the waiter comes over...

120
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,700
Champagne?

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Um, we didn't order champagne.

122
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,300
Compliments of the house.

123
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Wow.

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,700
Thanks.

125
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,100
Cheers.

126
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,400
And there, sitting at the bottom
of my champagne glass is...

127
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Mini quiche.

128
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,300
You're a mega-douche.

129
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,300
Oh, that's right, they moved that
table back toward the kitchen,

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,900
because that's where they're setting
up a surprise chocolate fountain.

131
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, no, I gave it away.

132
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
So what was in the glass?

133
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,900
Right.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,600
So the waiter comes up
with two glasses of Dom.

135
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,900
He says, "Champagne?"
"We didn't order any champagne."

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,500
"Compliments of
the house." "Wow."

137
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
You said that already!

138
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,800
Right. So Robin looks down,

139
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,800
and there at the
bottom of her glass...

140
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,000
Is an engagement ring.

141
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Anything you want to say
to the bride and groom?

142
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,700
Don't get married.

143
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,700
Why don't I come back.

144
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,500
An engagement ring?

145
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,700
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
Ted, you cannot do
this to me. No.

147
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,900
No, no, no!

148
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
That's what she said.

149
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,800
No.

150
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me.

151
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,600
No. No, no, no.

152
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,900
What are you talking about?

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,700
This. This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?

154
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Oh, God, listen...
I just got to get out of here.

155
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,300
That's not mine.

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,500
What?

157
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,300
That's not mine.

158
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,900
Then whose is it?

159
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,700
It's mine.

160
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Janna...

161
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
will you marry me?

162
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,200
Yes.

163
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Wow.

164
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,200
That was hilarious.
I was like... what?

165
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,100
Anyway.

166
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,800
What the hell was that?

167
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,700
What the hell was what?

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,500
That reaction?

169
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
I thought you were
proposing to me.

170
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,800
Really? Because it sounded like you
thought I was trying to set you on fire.

171
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,100
Ted, you know how I
feel about marriage.

172
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,500
Now more than ever.

173
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,700
I'm sorry,
were you planning on proposing tonight?

174
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,400
No.

175
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Then why is this an issue?

176
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,100
Because even though you
don't want to get married,

177
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,200
I'd like to think the fact that
we've been together for a year,

178
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,700
and that we love each other
might get me a gentler reaction

179
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,900
than, "No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
"Ted, you cannot do this to me.

181
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,300
"No. No, no, no."

182
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,800
Okay, you're right, I just...
freaked out.

183
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,400
I don't know why.

184
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,800
Can we please just let it go?

186
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,400
No.

187
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
Hey, Stinson.

188
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,100
Never lie to a man about
a chocolate fountain.

189
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,000
So did you guys find
anything to eat?

190
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,500
I had four strawberries.

191
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,900
Was there a side of champagne
with each of the strawberries?

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
Yes.

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,300
Lily, you could have burped
or said the word "Yes,"

194
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,900
but the fact that you did both
is exactly why I married you.

195
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,100
Oh, look, more strawberries!

196
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,300
So what happened next?

197
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,600
- Ted, don't do this.
- No, seriously.

198
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,400
Where do you see
yourself in five years?

199
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,000
Where do you see yourself?

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,300
Honestly, in five years...

201
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,700
I probably want to be married.

202
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
And I probably want
to be in Argentina.

203
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,800
- Argentina?
- Or Tokyo, or Paris.

204
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,600
Look, Ted, I don't know where
I'm going to be in five years.

205
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,600
And I don't want to know.
I want my life to be an adventure.

206
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,600
We have an expiration date,
don't we?

207
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Oh, my God.

208
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,500
You guys broke up.

209
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,200
You guys broke up.
I can't believe it.

210
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
Barney...

211
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
story's not over.

212
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,300
Can we please not talk about this here.
Can we go home?

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Yeah, of course.

214
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,200
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this.
Can we actually...

215
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,800
Oh, my God, it's you.

216
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,300
Wha... what?

217
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,300
You're the son of a bitch who
stole our blue French horn.

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Run!

219
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,500
Run? Your strategy was run?

220
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,900
It was a perfectly good idea.

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
They didn't have our
credit card information.

222
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
They didn't know us from Adam.

223
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
I stand by it.

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,600
Yeah?

225
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,200
And how did that
work out for you?

226
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,200
I don't see why they had to keep
my credit card and driver's license

227
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,700
till we bring the horn back.

228
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
Well, come on, Ted,
can you blame them?

229
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Look, I'm sorry about
the French horn.

230
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,500
I want to make this right.

231
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,900
So what we're going to do right now is,
we're going to run!

232
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,900
So... Argentina.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,500
Argentina.

234
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,900
Why is this the first
I've heard of Argentina?

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,700
Mmm, American schools
suck at geography.

236
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,400
What would be the point in telling
you that I want to live in Argentina?

237
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,600
You don't want to live there.

238
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
I could want to
live in Argentina.

239
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
No, you couldn't.

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I mean,
you life is here and your career.

241
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm a journalist,
my career could take me anywhere,

242
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,000
and I hope it does.

243
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,300
Hey. I could be an
architect anywhere, too.

244
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
They have buildings
in Argentina.

245
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,700
And Paris. And even Tokyo.

246
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,700
I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but
he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.

247
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,800
So, what? You're saying you
want to move to Argentina?

248
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,100
Well, I always regretted not taking
a year in college to live abroad.

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,700
I just finished a
big project at work.

250
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,000
I got some money saved up.

251
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,300
If ever there were a time in my life to
do something like this, it's right now.

252
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,900
Let's move to Argentina.

253
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,900
Oh, shut up.

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,100
You're scared
I might not be kidding.

255
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,500
Aren't you?

256
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
Nope.

257
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,500
Your move, Scherbatsky.

258
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,600
Okay.

259
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Let's do it--
let's move to Argentina.

260
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,200
No es posible!

261
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Nobody moves to Argentina.

262
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,800
The Argentinean peso has dropped
two-thirds in five years,

263
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,100
the government is opposed
to free market reforms,

264
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,500
and the railroad has been a mess since
the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos.

265
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,700
I hooked up with an
Argentinean exchange student

266
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,500
in a Porta-John
outside Yankee Stadium.

267
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,300
Man, she was chatty.

268
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,900
Right? Right?

269
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,400
You caught the bouquet?

270
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,700
Barney.

271
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
The story's not over yet.

272
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

273
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,100
I don't know if I
can do this to you.

274
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,900
Do what?

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,900
Well, you say you want
to move to Argentina,

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,500
but you want to have kids.

277
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh, right.
'Cause there are no kids there.

278
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,200
On Santa's map of the world,
there's a big black "X" over Argentina.

279
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

280
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,300
Okay, say we had kids.

281
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,900
They wouldn't have to grow
up in some suburb somewhere.

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,900
They would grow up on the road
having adventures with us.

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,100
Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe
T-shirts they could collect.

284
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,800
Ted, you know that kids were
never a part of my plan.

285
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,700
But if I was going to
have someone's babies,

286
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,600
I'd have your babies.

287
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,100
That's when you run.

288
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Tell me you ran, Ted.

289
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,900
Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to
start having babies right this second.

290
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Do you have a...?

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
No, I don't.

292
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, we probably shouldn't.

293
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah.

294
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,300
- Risk it?
- Risk it.

295
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,400
No.

296
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,600
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
if you're all gather around,

297
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,300
Lily and Marshall are
going to cut the cake.

298
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,800
No. Robin, you're not...

299
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,100
No, say the story's not over.

300
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,300
Come on,
they're cutting the cake.

301
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,800
Say the story's not over!

302
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,600
Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried
I've ever been that someone's pregnant.

303
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,700
Okay, Lily.

304
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,500
I'm really hungry, so let's just,
uh, aim for my mouth, okay?

305
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Besides, the smearing the cake
thing's a cliché, remember?

306
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,600
No, it's going to be so funny.

307
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,000
Lily.

308
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,500
Lily, just feed me the cake.

309
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,600
Please, baby, I am so hungry.

310
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,900
Whoopsy-daisy.

311
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,000
And she's okay.

312
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,100
- She's all right.
- That was funny.

313
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
And it's time for
the honeymoon.

314
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,800
Guys, guys, guys.
Thank you so much.

315
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,100
We love you.

316
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
I love you.

317
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,000
Getting married, having kids.

318
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,400
It's all a mistake.
It's a horrible, horrible mistake.

319
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,600
God, this guy's
giving me nothing.

320
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,300
All right,
have fun in Scotland.

321
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,700
If you see the Loch Ness Monster,
tell him Ted Mosby says, "What's up?"

322
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,900
Nessie's a she, Ted, come on.

323
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,400
Hey, kiddo.

324
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,200
You are going to miss out
on a lot of awesome stuff.

325
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
You'll be at home with the kid

326
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,100
while I am out awesome-ing
all over the place.

327
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,900
And you're going to get fat.

328
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
The story's not over, Barney.

329
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,600
Okay, time to get the
horn back to the bistro.

330
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again.
That tuckered me out.

331
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Not a euphemism.

332
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Right. Okay, let me just go change,
and we'll leave.

333
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,400
Whoa, whoa,
you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh.

334
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,900
Solidarity, sister.

335
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,200
That is crazy. I have a change of
clothes and you don't. Suck it up.

336
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,900
Well, if we'd actually moved in
together, all my stuff would be here,

337
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,800
but we didn't, so...

338
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah.

339
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
We were all talk, weren't we?

340
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,600
We're not doing this, are we?

341
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,500
I don't want to have
kids in Argentina.

342
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,400
And I don't want to
have kids in Argentina.

343
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
So where does that leave us?

344
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,600
Well...

345
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
we could stay together and...

346
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,900
pretend this stuff
doesn't matter.

347
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,700
Or...

348
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,400
we could give back
the blue French horn.

349
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,600
You stole a blue
French horn for me.

350
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I would have stolen
you a whole orchestra.

351
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
You did break up.

352
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,900
Yep.

353
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,300
You're not pregnant?

354
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,600
Nope.

355
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,300
An-And Marshall and
Lily don't know?

356
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Well, afterwards, uh,
we came by to tell you guys,

357
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,400
but Lily was pretty
stressed out, so...

358
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,000
We decided not to say anything
till after the wedding.

359
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,400
You guys okay?

360
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,700
Well, it hasn't been the easiest
two weeks of our lives, but...

361
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,800
But we're okay.

362
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,300
The open bar helps.

363
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,400
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Hi.

364
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,300
Could I have this dance?

365
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,500
Well, we knew this day
would come eventually.

366
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,300
Take care of her, little man.

367
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,200
This is by far the drunkest
I've ever seen you.

368
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,900
Uh, driver.

369
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,200
Hello!

370
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,500
Ranjit.

371
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Hey, can we make a stop before
we head back to the hotel?

372
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,600
You do not have to stop.

373
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,400
You can be together as man
and wife right back there,

374
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
and because we are friends...

375
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
I will not watch.

376
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,500
Um, no,
we actually had something else in mind.

377
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Okay.

378
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,200
Lily, go sit down.

379
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,400
Welcome to Wienerburger.

380
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,400
Hi.

381
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,100
Can we get a number one,
please, with no pickles?

382
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,600
And a number four
with no onions.

383
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,200
Let me guess.
Jefferson High prom?

384
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,500
No.

385
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,800
But thank you.

386
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,600
Actually, we just got married.

387
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,800
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

388
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,800
That's $7.80.

389
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,100
- Hey, dude.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know how to say this, but
your wife just threw up in the trash.

391
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,900
My wife.

392
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,600
So Marshall and
Lily were married,

393
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
and Robin and I were broken up.

394
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,500
And as hard as it
was at the time,

395
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,500
in the end we both
got what we wanted.

396
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,400
She did eventually go
on to live in Argentina

397
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,100
and Morocco and Greece, Russia,

398
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
even Japan for a little while.

399
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,700
And I... well, I met your mom.

400
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,400
I think for the most part if
you're really honest with yourself

401
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,100
about what you
want out of life,

402
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,800
life gives it to you.

403
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,000
Of course, at that moment, all I
really wanted was a scotch and soda

404
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,600
and a cigar.

405
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm really sorry
about you and Robin.

406
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,900
I know I was always joking around
about wanting you two to break up,

407
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,700
but you were really
good together.

408
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah...

409
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,600
we were.

410
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,100
She just wasn't the one,
you know?

411
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
The one. Oh, Ted, no.

412
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,000
Do not tell me you're going to
start searching for "the one" again.

413
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
The only time I want to
hear you saying "the one"

414
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
is if it's followed by the
word "hundredth." What up?

415
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,600
No, I need a break
from all that, I...

416
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,200
I just want to get out there and
have fun for a while, you know?

417
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
Really?

418
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,500
'Cause...

419
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,700
you know, you've been in
a relationship for a year.

420
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,000
You're going to...
be a little rusty.

421
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,800
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying...

422
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,700
you're gonna need, need,
need some help out there.

423
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
Could be.

424
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,800
Ted?

425
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,600
Yes, Barney.

426
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
Do you think...

427
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,100
Do you think maybe you might...

428
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,500
need a wingman again?

429
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
I do.

430
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,400
Yes!

431
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes! We're back.

432
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,800
We are back.

433
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,300
And Ted, my boy,
it's going to be legend...

434
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Wait for it.

435
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,600
