1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,100
Kids, you remember
my first day with Robin.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,700
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?!

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,500
Well, here's the thing, normal people,
you know, people who aren't your dad,

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,200
usually take longer to say "I love you."

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
Robin went through the usual stages.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,300
- Spider! Spider!
- I left something in the hallway.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
- Where?
- Right there.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,200
Got it.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,600
First there's the moment
when you think you think it.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Whoa, still alive.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,100
There's the moment
you think you know it.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
Oh, you don't want to kiss me,
you'll get sick.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,500
Totally worth it.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,400
There's the moment where you know
you know it, but you can't yet say it.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,300
All right, it's getting to be that time.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Good night.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Good night.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,300
Wait, Ted?

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Yeah?

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,900
Good night.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,200
Well, great, I'll see you then.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,600
Bye, sweetie.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey. Guess what?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My sister Katie is coming
to visit next weekend.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
She gets in on Thursday.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
That's awesome.
You know what I'm going to do?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm going to take off work Friday.

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,000
We're gonna take her
to the Empire State Building.

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,200
Really? You'd do that?

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Of course. Everyone should see
the Empire State Building.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,700
And then there's the moment
where you know you know it,

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
and you can't keep it in any longer.

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,300
- Ted. 
- Yeah?

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,600
Falafel.

35
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,200
- Falafel?
- Falafel.

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,600
Instead of telling Ted you love him,
you said "falafel"?

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,200
- I totally choked.
- I just don't get it.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
Why can't you tell Ted you love him?

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, God, you'd think you never
said it to a guy before.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
No.

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Okay, well, I don't usually get
this far in the relationship.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I usually take the three-week exit.

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,300
Don't tell me you're actually buying
into Barney's freeway theory.

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,600
Watch your steps when you get up, kids,
'cause I am about to drop some knowledge.

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Relationships are like a freeway.

47
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,300
Wait a minute, a month ago you told me
relationships are like a traveling circus.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,300
No, this is new.
This trumps that.

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,200
Freeways have exits.
So do relationships.

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,000
The first exit, my personal favorite,
is six hours in.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,900
You meet, you talk, you have sex,
you exit when she's in the shower.

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,700
So every girl you have sex with feels
the immediate need to shower?

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Actually, yeah, I get that.

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,100
The next exits are four days,
three weeks, seven months--

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
that's when you guys are gonna
break up, mark your calendars.

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,600
What?

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,400
Then a year and a half, 18 years,
and the last exit-- death.

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,500
Which, if you've been with the same woman
for your entire life,

59
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,900
it's like, "Are we there yet?"

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
So I've never been on the freeway
this long before.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,900
I mean, usually by now I find out
the guy has some weird personality thing

62
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,600
that makes me want
to take the next exit.

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Yeah, been there.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,200
I once dated a guy who could only go to
the bathroom when classical music was playing.

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, it was Marshall.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,300
It's just things are going so well with
Ted I just don't want to complicate it.

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,700
Relax, it'll happen when it happens.

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Which is also the advice I gave Marshall
to get him over the classical music thing.

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,700
Oh, here comes Katie.

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
- Aw, your sister's so cute.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,000
This reminds me of when I used to see
her coming up the driveway from school,

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,400
with her little pigtails
and her Hello Kitty backpack.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,500
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, no.

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,000
No. No. No.

75
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,600
- Hey, Robin. How are you?
- Oh, good. Good.

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,600
So, who is this... tongue person?

77
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,000
Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.

78
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,100
Looks like hotness runs in the family.

79
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,400
Oh, you said that.
Great.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
So how long have you two been...?

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,200
- Two whole months.
- Yeah.

82
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,500
He's actually coming to visit
family in New York, too.

83
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Isn't that great?

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,700
My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad,
but he buys me beer, so...

85
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,700
That's cool.
This is my friend Lily.

86
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Hot.

87
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,900
You say things!

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, come on, let's get you back
to my place, we'll get you settled.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,300
Um, actually, I'm going
to stay with Kyle tonight.

90
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,400
- Uh, no, you're not.
- Oh, come on.

91
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,300
It's kind of a special night.

92
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,600
If you know what I mean.

93
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,300
What?

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,700
Oh. Oh...

95
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I can't believe my baby sister is planning
to lose her virginity to a...

96
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,600
...douche with a faux hawk.

97
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,300
This can't happen.

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,600
You guys have to help me
talk her out of it.

99
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,800
Speech to talk a girl out of having sex.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Yeah, I don't have any of those.

101
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,500
Discouraging premarital sex
is against my religion.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Please? I'm her older sister.

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,300
I'm supposed to teach her how to make
good and responsible decisions.

104
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
It's 2:00 and you've already
had three scotch and sodas.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
That's why I need your help.

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
Robin convinced Katie to stay with her
that first night.

107
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,800
And the next day, I took everybody
to the Empire State Building.

108
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,900
You guys are lucky
you came here with an architect.

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,700
Empire State Building fun
fact number one:

110
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,200
When construction began
on March 17, 1930,

111
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,400
the framework rose at a rate
of four and a half stories per week.

112
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
Four and a half stories per week.

113
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,300
Four and a half stories per week.

114
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,900
There it is.
There it is. Come on.

115
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,700
These are fun facts, guys,
let's have fun with them.

116
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,800
You know, Katie, I have wanted to come
to the Empire State Building for so long,

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,500
but I waited to come here
with someone special.

118
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,100
Oh, here we go.

119
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,700
Marshall and I have never been to
the Empire State Building either.

120
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,400
But I'm so glad I waited to do something
so important with my fiancé.

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
Speaking of waiting, I signed
an abstinence pledge in high school.

122
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,500
It's totally cool to wait.

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
And stay away from drugs...
other than pot.

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,900
- You told them?
- Oh, okay, yes, I told them.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But only because I think you should 
hear it from other grownups, too.

126
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,400
Everyone thinks you should wait.
Right, guys?

127
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,300
- Totally. You should wait.
- Sex is fun.

128
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
See?

129
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
You are such a hypocrite.
You were only 16 when you lost yours.

130
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,400
Well, how do you know that?

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
You left your diary in your old room
slash my new room.

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,100
I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,500
Look, I've been dating Kyle
for two months now.

134
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,800
It's like forever.

135
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,300
I mean, we've already done
everything else.

136
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,600
- I mean, we've even...
- Oh. La, la, la, la, la.

137
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,500
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la.

138
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,300
Even Kyle gets to do that.

139
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
You have no right to tell me
not to do it.

140
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,400
But Kyle?
Why can't you just wait?

141
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,500
Because if you wait,
you can get a nice guy like Ted.

142
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,000
Robin, this is happening.

143
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,100
Look, I already put it up
on my Myspace page.

144
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,600
- I need a clove.
- You smoke now, too?

145
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
- Oh, remember cloves?
- No!

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,100
No "Aw, remember cloves?"
This can't happen.

147
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
She's my baby sister, okay?

148
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,700
She should be watching The Little Mermaid
and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex.

149
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,800
Come on, you were only 16
when you had sex.

150
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,700
- I was 17.
- We were 18.

151
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,500
Barney was probably 12.

152
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,500
Good one, Ted.

153
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,900
I was, uh, six... fourt...

154
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,500
How old were you again?

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,200
- 17.
- Dude, me, too.

156
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
- Barney, you okay?
- Yeah, of course.

157
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,400
What, you don't believe me?

158
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,700
- It was at camp, so I'm...
- What camp?

159
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,100
This place in the Catskills.
Look it up.

160
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,100
I was there teaching for the summer.

161
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,100
What did you teach?

162
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
Uh, dance.

163
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,200
Dance?

164
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,700
Yeah, Ted, dance.
Maybe you've heard of it.

165
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,800
It was just a simple summer job,
but it turned into so much more.

166
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,500
Her name was Frances Houseman,
but everyone called her Baby.

167
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,700
# Sylvia #

168
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,100
# Yes, Mickey? #

169
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,300
# How you call your loverboy? #

170
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,700
# Come here, loverboy #

171
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,700
# And if he doesn't answer #

172
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,200
# Oh, loverboy #

173
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
# And if he still doesn't answer? #

174
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,200
# I simply say, baby... #

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,800
# Oh, baby #

176
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,000
# My sweet baby #

177
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
That's Dirty Dancing.

178
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,500
- It was on last night.
- No, it was two nights ago.

179
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,000
"She's Like the Wind" has been stuck
in my brain for about 40 hours.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,700
I just got it out.
Now it's back in.

181
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
Damn you, Swayze!

182
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,500
- Do you remember our first time?
- Yeah.

183
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,800
It was back in college.

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
Oh, wait, wait. 

185
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,600
Look... I really want to do this, but...

186
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,200
we should make it special, you know?

187
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Do this right.

188
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,700
Okay.

189
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
You're right.

190
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,300
Maybe we could go to the beach
and get a house for the weekend.

191
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,700
Yeah, New Year's Eve.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Okay.

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,300
Oh, and we'll light candles and
maybe put on some classical music.

194
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,800
That's not a good idea.

195
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Why not?

196
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,800
Long story.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But maybe we could put on some Al Green
and take a bubble bath together.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,700
Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.

199
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh, I love you, Marshall.

200
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,700
I'm so glad we're waiting.

201
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,600
Oops.

202
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,000
- Oh, that's adorable. 
- Yeah, tell her what happened next.

203
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
Want to do it again?

205
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,900
Please don't.

206
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,900
- We said we were sorry.
- Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?

207
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,000
You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,100
The point is no matter what, it's never
gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.

209
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,400
Well, mine was terrible.

210
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
Wait, I've never heard your story.

211
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Well, as you know, I was 16.

212
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
And it was with my boyfriend Brian.

213
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,600
- Ready?
- Yeah.

214
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,600
- This feels so right.
- Oh, I know.

215
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,400
- Oh, Robin.
- Oh, Brian.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,900
Yeah, I'm gay.

217
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,300
- I'm so sorry.
- Eh, I should've known.

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
There were signs.

219
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,300
Oh, my God!

220
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,900
My mom's home.
Quick!

221
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,600
- Get under my bed.
- What?!

222
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Oh, my God!

223
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
You only get one shot
at losing your virginity.

224
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,900
And even though I just barely had sex,
it counts.

225
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,800
What do you mean just barely?

226
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,700
Well, he didn't dive all
the way into the pool, but he...

227
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,300
splashed around in the shallow end.

228
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,700
Then you didn't lose
your virginity to him.

229
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,300
- Just barely doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.

230
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,500
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

231
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,700
No, it doesn't. It doesn't count.
End of story.

232
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,800
Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin,
you saucy little harlot.

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,700
Could it be that before Marshall took
a swim, someone else tested the water?

234
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,600
No. Nobody else tested the water, right?

235
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,400
Scooter?

236
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,500
Who's Scooter?

237
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,000
My high school boyfriend,
who I did not have sex with.

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,600
I... I can't believe this.

239
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,000
We're Marshall and Lily--
when people see us, they say,

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,200
"Oh, look at them, they've only
had sex with each other."

241
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,900
No, Marshall, they say,
"Oh, look at them,

242
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,200
they've only had sex with each other."

243
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,500
But now that's not true anymore--

244
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
now you've had sex with twice
as many people as I have.

245
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,900
I knew that you were too good at it.

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Know what? I don't want to see
the stupid Empire State Building anymore.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,800
- It's not stupid.
- I'm going to see Kyle.

248
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,500
Katie, please.
You only get to lose your virginity once.

249
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
You should only be having sex
with someone who's special.

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,700
Oh, please-- you've had sex with,
like, a hundred guys.

251
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not a hundred guys.
It's not a hundred guys.

252
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm sure you were madly
in love with all of them.

253
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,800
I had different levels of feeling
for each of the...

254
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,000
very reasonable number of guys.

255
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,700
Really.

256
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,700
Well, do you love Ted?

257
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Do you love Ted ?

258
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,000
I, um... 

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,900
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 22:

260
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,200
The Empire State Building has tons of places
where people can have private conversations.

261
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,100
- You're off the hook, okay?
- Just let me explain.

262
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,600
You don't have to explain anything.
You don't have to say it-- it's fine.

263
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,300
Okay, but if relationships are
like a freeway, then saying...

264
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,900
"hm hm hm" is like...
getting into the carpool lane.

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,600
And I don't want to take an exit, but...

266
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,700
at the same time, I'm not ready
to get into the carpool lane.

267
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,500
Because what's in the carpool lane?

268
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Oh, it's a big diamond,
and I'm just not ready to get...

269
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,300
Okay, Robin, Robin, stop.

270
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,900
It's no big deal--
you don't have to say it.

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,300
It's just, it's a big thing to say to
someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.

272
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,900
What, you mean like I did?

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,500
No. I didn't...

274
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,800
Yeah, like you did.

275
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,300
I mean, you have to admit it,
Ted, it was a little weird.

276
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,100
- Weird... or courageous?
- Pretty sure weird. 

277
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
I mean, who gives it up
on the first date?

278
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,600
Well, come on, it shows I'm brave
and bold, like a knight.

279
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,100
No, it shows that
you're an I-love-you slut.

280
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,100
Well, then you're an I-love-you prude.

281
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,700
You know what?
I take mine back.

282
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,300
- You... What?
- I take my "I love you" back.

283
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,900
- You can't take it back.
- Nah. Just did. Got it right here.

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,100
But, you know, I'm such a slut,
I'm just gonna give it away.

285
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Hey, you, sir. I love you.

286
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,900
Thank you, man.

287
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
I was going up there to jump.

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,300
Marshall, why is this such a big deal?

289
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,700
Why is this such a big deal?

290
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,400
Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus,
guess who actually discovered the New World.

291
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,900
Some dude named Scooter.

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong,
it actually goes like this:

293
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,300
"One small step for man,
one giant leap for Scooter."

294
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,500
Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve

295
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
- before you did...
- Okay, Marshall, I get it.

296
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
It's a big deal because
it rewrites our history.

297
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
No, it doesn't.

298
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,500
Look, have you been to
the Empire State Building?

299
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,700
No. You've only been in the lobby.

300
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,000
People don't buy tickets
to get in the lobby.

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,400
They buy tickets to get to the top.

302
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,700
Scooter only got in the lobby,
and the lobby doesn't count.

303
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Really.

304
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,000
Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me
how to get to the Empire State Building?

305
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,000
Um, we're in it right now.

306
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,800
Thank you, sir.
You're a very wise and brilliant man.

307
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
You're right.

308
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,500
Why would I throw that all away?

309
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm having the best day!

310
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,100
Katie, I'll admit,
maybe I'm not in any place

311
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,400
to lecture you on romantic
relationships, but...

312
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,600
but I just don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I've made.

313
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,300
- Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.
- That's not what I meant.

314
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,300
I just wish you weren't
in such a rush to grow up.

315
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,300
Please don't do this.

316
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,800
But, kids, later that night,
Katie did it,

317
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,800
and she got pregnant...
with quintuplets...

318
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,900
and she lived out her days
in a trailer park...

319
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,200
where she died an alcoholic.

320
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,800
So the moral here, kids,
don't have sex until you're married.

321
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,800
Maybe even, like,
a year or two into marriage.

322
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
- Dad!
- Come on, what really happened?

323
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
All right, here's what really happened.

324
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

325
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,000
She didn't do it.

326
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,200
Hey, that's great! 
You got through to her.

327
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,700
No, I didn't. You did.

328
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
She told me that you talked to her.

329
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,700
Hey, Katie.

330
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Hey.

331
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,200
Got another Empire State
Building fun fact for me?

332
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,000
No. I wouldn't bore you
with the seven million man-hours

333
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,400
it took to build this 102-story
testament to human will.

334
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,000
So, you okay?

335
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,300
I don't know what everyone
is freaking out about.

336
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,700
Kyle, he's a really nice guy.

337
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,100
He could've cheated on me with my lab
partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't.

338
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,100
'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.

339
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,800
That's very gallant.

340
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,600
Well, I don't know what your sister's
freaking out about, either.

341
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,800
- I was your age my first time.
- Oh, really?

342
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah, yeah. It was, uh,
it was with this girl, Molly.

343
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,000
I love you, Ted.

344
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,400
Oh, I love you, too, Molly.

345
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,800
But I didn't.

346
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,900
That was amazing.

347
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,800
Look, I got to go.

348
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
Where are you going?

349
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,000
My cousin got some firecrackers
from Mexico.

350
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,300
We're going out to the woods to light 'em--
it's gonna be awesome.

351
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,900
Well, will you call me?

352
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,200
Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.

353
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,300
But I didn't.

354
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Molly?

355
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
Yeah?

356
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,600
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.

357
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,600
But I didn't.

358
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
And I never saw her again.

359
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,200
I told her I loved her, but...
I just wanted to have sex.

360
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,000
I-I would've said anything
to make that happen, and...

361
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,800
that's exactly what I did.

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,900
Look, I'm not telling you what to do.

363
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm just telling you what
all 17-year-old boys are like.

364
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,200
Even the nice ones.

365
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,400
So I told Kyle I wanted to wait...
and he dumped me.

366
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,200
Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

367
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
Aw, honey.

368
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,300
I promise everything is gonna be okay.

369
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,300
You want to watch The Little Mermaid
and drink some YooHoo?

370
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,900
Only if you put a buttload
of Kahlua in it.

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
Don't tell Mom.

372
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
Thanks for doing that.

373
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,800
You're welcome.
I knew it meant a lot to you.

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,300
But, man, your story, I mean,
it doesn't even sound like you.

375
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,700
Yeah, well...

376
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
I love you, Molly.

377
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, I love you, too, Ted.

378
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,600
Wow. That was amazing.

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Look, I got to go.

380
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,800
Wh-Where are you going?

381
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,400
Uh, my cousin got
some firecrackers from Mexico.

382
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,200
We're going into the woods
to light them.

383
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,600
It's gonna be awesome.

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,200
Will you call me?

385
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah. I'll totally call you.

386
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,300
- Oh, Ted?
- Yeah?

387
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,900
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.

388
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,500
- But she didn't.
- Oh, come here.

389
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
I love you.

390
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
I said it.

391
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,900
Feels right.

392
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
- I love you.
- I'm gay.

393
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
I'm kidding.

394
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,000
I love you, too.

395
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,900
Hey... you lost
your I-love-you-ginity.

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,100
Yeah.

397
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,200
I guess I was just waiting
for the right guy.

398
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,200
Katie ended up having
a great first time in New York.

399
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,400
And the last thing we did before she left
was go to the Empire State Building.

400
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,700
I am so glad we're finally doing this.

401
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
What are you talking about?
We were here yesterday.

402
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
Yeah, but that didn't really count.

403
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
- Oh, crap.
- Exactly!

404
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,600
So yesterday doesn't count as having
gone to the Empire State Building.

405
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,000
So I lost it to you, Marshall.

406
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,000
And I rode that elevator to the top,

407
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,200
and I saw that view,
and I basked in the awesomeness.

408
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
And that's our story.

409
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,800
Yeah. Yeah, that's our story.

410
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,900
We've only had sex with each other.

411
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We've only had sex with each other.

412
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,400
They've only had sex with each other.

413
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go.

414
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,200
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 81:

415
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,700
There are 1,860 steps from this...
Whoa, whoa! Come on!

416
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,900
So, now you guys can finally say you've
been to the Empire State Building.

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
How have you lived here so long
and never been to the top?

418
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,700
Well, we're usually busy... drinking.

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Speaking of first times,
we never got to hear

420
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,700
- your virginity story.
- That's right, I almost forgot.

421
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,300
Okay. I was 16,
and it was in a baseball dugout...

422
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,500
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

423
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I mean, I was in a subway
with a high-priced call girl...

424
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,300
Risky Business.

425
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,500
I was accidentally hacking
into NORAD'S computer...

426
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,800
That's War Games, and there's not even
a sex scene in it.

427
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,100
All right!

428
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,500
I was 23, and it was with my mom's
45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda.

429
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,000
She called me "Barry" the whole time,
and for two weeks,

430
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,200
my comforter smelled like menthol
cigarettes. You happy?

431
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Hey...

432
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,900
Why don't you tell us again about your
first time at the camp in the Catskills.

433
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,000
Baby and her family spent
every summer at Kellerman's.

434
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,100
Her dad did not approve of our love.

435
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,500
- Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
- Oh, God, no.

436
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,300
What can I say, I...

437
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,200
had... the time of my life.

438
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,200
True story.
