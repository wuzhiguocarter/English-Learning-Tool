1
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:03,995
..learn about relationships
is that you're never done

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,382
getting to know someone.

3
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:07,133
Everyone has secrets.

4
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:08,423
Some are nice.

5
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,581
You know how to make crepes?

6
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,072
That is so cool.

7
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:16,675
Some aren't as nice.

8
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:19,060
And then there was Derek,
and counting you,

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,943
- that puts the total up to--
- Oh, I got your total.

10
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:23,830
I've been counting along.

11
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:27,635
And some are just weird.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,137
You're scared of
the seven dwarfs?

13
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:31,787
Just Doc. He's creepy.

14
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,653
I mean the guy went
to medical school.

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,070
What's he doing living
with six coal miners?

16
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,753
Oh, man! I'm so excited.
I couldn't sleep last night.

17
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:40,672
- I bet you guys couldn't either.
- Why?

18
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,633
Only the Gala event
for the Grand Opening

19
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:45,490
of Sharper Image's 500th store.
Didn't you get my email?

20
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:48,003
No, I blocked your address
after the fourth time

21
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:51,450
you sent me the video of the
monkey sniffing his own butt.

22
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,970
Come on! It's on me.
I'm buying three of you foot massagers

23
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,570
and one of you a nose hair trimmer.
You know who you are.

24
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:58,031
Come on, let's go.

25
00:00:58,046 --> 00:00:59,013
Okay, I'm in.

26
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:01,320
- To the Willowbrook Mall!
- To the Willowbrook Mall.

27
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:04,270
Oh, it's at a mall?
I'm not going.

28
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:05,520
What? Why not?

29
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,630
I just don't feel
like going to a mall.

30
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,563
We can split a Cinnabon.

31
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,372
No, I'm really not going to go.

32
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:14,270
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- No, I don't go to malls!

33
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,600
Sorry, I just don't like malls.

34
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:20,240
Why not?

35
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:22,673
I'd rather not say.

36
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,823
- Sharper Images.
- But that's where clothes live.

37
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,923
Guys, guys, guys,
Robin doesn't like malls.

38
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,321
If she doesn't want to tell us why,
she doesn't have to.

39
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,671
I think we should all
just respect her privacy.

40
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:33,100
Thanks, Ted.

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,350
So, what's the deal
with you and malls?

42
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,163
I thought you said that,
if I didn't want to talk about it,

43
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,312
I didn't have to.

44
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,051
Yeah, with those people.

45
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,941
But I'm your boyfriend.
Come on. What is it?

46
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:43,051
Did you get arrested at a mall?

47
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:43,701
No.

48
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:45,522
- Dumped at a mall?
- Ted.

49
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,631
Found out you were
Canadian at a mall?

50
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:48,613
Let it go.

51
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:50,323
Trapped under a fake
boulder at a mall?

52
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,603
- Let it go.
- Mauled at the mall?

53
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:54,001
Let it go!

54
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:58,123
And who gets trapped under
a fake boulder at the mall?

55
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:02,721
Not me in Ohio when I was nine,
that's for sure.

56
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,521
I don't get it. Why won't Robin
tell me why she hates malls?

57
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,832
Ted, you should be happy
Robin has a secret.

58
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,202
The more you learn
about a person,

59
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:29,460
the better chance you have of
hitting the fatal "Oh" moment.

60
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:30,590
The "Oh" moment?

61
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:34,361
Yeah, that moment when you find
out that one detail about a person

62
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:36,472
that is going to
be a deal breaker.

63
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,121
It's a promise ring.

64
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:41,651
I made a pact with God to stay
a virgin till I'm married.

65
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:45,882
I don't have an
eating disorder.

66
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:50,040
It's just when I put food in my mouth,
I chew it, and then I spit it out.

67
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,552
I just turned 30.

68
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:58,442
So trust me,
you want to postpone

69
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,321
knowing anything about each
other for as long as possible.

70
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:04,330
Mmm. I disagree.
If there is some potential "Oh" moment,

71
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:07,152
I want to know about it right away.
I mean, what's the alternative?

72
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:10,641
I now pronounce you,
man and wife.

73
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:14,351
I love you.

74
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,523
I used to be a dude.

75
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,862
Yeah,  I agree with Ted.

76
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,821
In a real relationship,
you share everything.

77
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,321
That's why Marshall and
I don't keep any secrets.

78
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,723
You are such a cutie pie.
Here's a quarter.

79
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:29,602
Go play a song on the jukebox.

80
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:31,883
No, it's true.
They tell each other everything.

81
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:34,823
I can think of tons of things,
there's no way Marshall's told you.

82
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:36,040
Try me.

83
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,371
Do you know about the time
Marshall was in Trenton?

84
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,050
Donkey ate his pants. Yup.

85
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,663
Bill's bachelor
party in Memphis?

86
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:45,623
Oh, when they had to pump out
all the nickels from his stomach?

87
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,711
Wow. Okay. Seattle.

88
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,553
Trick question. Marshall's never
been to the Pacific Northwest

89
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,680
because he's afraid
of Sasquatch.

90
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:53,952
Damn, you're good.

91
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:57,501
I'm not afraid of Sasquatch,
I just think we should all be on alert.

92
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:01,242
Trust me. Not only do they
tell each other everything,

93
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:03,413
they want to know everything.

94
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,630
So after the shower I was brushing
my teeth. And I was like,

95
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,541
"Oh, man!
I wanted to have some orange juice.

96
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:08,880
I should have done that first."

97
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,553
But I already had the
toothpaste on the toothbrush.

98
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:13,060
So I just went ahead
and brushed them anyway.

99
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:15,222
What happened next?

100
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:20,030
Yeah, meanwhile,
Robin tells me nothing.

101
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,783
Fine. Do you want to know
what Robin's secret is?

102
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:23,871
You know?

103
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,342
Of course I know.

104
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:27,270
She couldn't look at us,
her face got flushed--

105
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:28,922
that's shame, my friend.

106
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:33,721
Our friend Robin used to do porn,
wait for it...

107
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:35,783
...ography.

108
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,450
Yeah, we didn't really
need to wait for that.

109
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:40,180
And it's ridiculous.

110
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,701
I don't know.
He could be right.

111
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:44,403
She does have the fake
orgasm noises down.

112
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,191
Hey!

113
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,800
What? The walls are thin.

114
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,493
That's not what I'm
"hey"ing you about.

115
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,503
You know what it might be?

116
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:55,453
This is going to sound a little
crazy but what if Robin is married?

117
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:58,103
Married? What does that
have to do with the mall?

118
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:00,793
Well, maybe she got
married at the mall.

119
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,490
Back home in Minnesota,
a ton of people get married

120
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,561
at the Mall of America.
It's great.

121
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:07,280
There's this gorgeous indoor
golf course for pictures,

122
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,793
numerous fine dining options,
and talk about a reasonable--

123
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,851
- We are not getting married at the mall!
- Well, just meet with the guy.

124
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,522
She's not married.
Robin hates marriage.

125
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:17,951
Because she already 
got married.

126
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,681
At the mall.

127
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:22,851
No, because before Robin
moved to New York, she...

128
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:24,820
What was she doing?

129
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, I don't know.
Whenever I ask her about Canada,

130
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:29,202
she kind of clams up.

131
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:31,060
She's a pretty private person.

132
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:33,940
Except when she's
talking about...

133
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:36,502
Oh, a friend of mine in Canada
got married way too young

134
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:39,030
and it really turned
her off to marriage.

135
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:40,733
What  do you think of
this wedding cake?

136
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,241
Oh, I like it.

137
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:43,760
Hey, you remember that
friend of mine in Canada

138
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:45,402
who got married way too young?

139
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,741
Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Fields'
giant cookie.

140
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,321
No.

141
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:56,230
My friend in Canada who
got married way too young,

142
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:58,613
they had to do their vows twice,
once in French.

143
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,200
They speak French there, too?

144
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:02,195
God, that place is a mess.

145
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,197
So you don't think there's
any "friend" from Canada?

146
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,507
Oh, I'm sure there is.

147
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,212
Just like I have a "friend" who
wet his bed till he was ten.

148
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:11,920
Use your brain, Ted.

149
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,732
Guys, there's no way
Robin is married.

150
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,483
It's ludicrous to
even suggest it.

151
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:20,741
- Thank you, Barney.
- 'Cause it's porn.

152
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,413
I need another beer.

153
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,713
Robin was not in porn.
I bet you anything that she's married.

154
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:27,311
$20,000 says it's porn.

155
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:28,652
I don't have $20,000.

156
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,551
Well, then what do you have?

157
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:33,121
- Well...
- No.

158
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,572
I've got it.
The ultimate wager--

159
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,861
slap bet.

160
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:40,103
Oh, slap bet.
We used to do those when I was a kid.

161
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,421
What the hell's a slap bet?

162
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,412
Whoever is right gets to slap
the other person in the face

163
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,703
as hard as they possibly can--
but no rings.

164
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,393
Are you really going to do that?
That's so immature.

165
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:51,111
- You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.
- Ooh, I love it. What are my powers?

166
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:54,183
Um, if a problem arises and we
need a ruling, that's your job.

167
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,973
But you have to be unbiased

168
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:59,232
and put the integrity of
slap bet above all else.

169
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:01,971
This is an honor you will
take with you to your grave.

170
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,710
On your tombstone,
it will read,

171
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:07,050
"Lily Aldrin, caring wife,
loving friend,

172
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,043
Slap Bet Commissioner."

173
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:13,890
And your tombstone will read "Got
slapped by Marshall, so hard he died."

174
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:19,413
Okay. What if I just ask Robin
point blank if she has a husband?

175
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:21,520
You said you would
respect her privacy,

176
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:23,710
so maybe you should
just drop it.

177
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:25,593
Yeah, you're right.

178
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,932
Husband.

179
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,472
There's no "P" in husband.

180
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,472
Wow, you seem to know
a lot about husbands.

181
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:38,013
Fine. I'll take it back.

182
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:41,072
Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands,
this is great, you're going to love this.

183
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,703
Marshall, you know Marshall.
He thinks that the reason

184
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,242
you didn't want to go to
the mall the other day

185
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:49,371
is because you got married at a
mall and have a husband in Canada.

186
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:53,143
I told him he's crazy.
Because he's crazy, right?

187
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,583
I mean, how crazy is that?

188
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,912
Are you asking me
if I'm married?

189
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,192
Well, you can ask me.

190
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,332
Nope, I'm not married.
Your turn.

191
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:03,450
What happened to
respecting my privacy?

192
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:06,121
Look, just say, "No,
I'm not married."

193
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,950
Ted,  I don't understand
why you can't--

194
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:10,510
Just say, "No,
I'm not married."

195
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:12,162
I can't.

196
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:14,182
Marshall's right.

197
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,980
I was young and I got married.

198
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:20,961
It was a mistake and 
he moved away, but...

199
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:23,801
yeah. I'm married.

200
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,752
You have a husband?

201
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,693
I was young and stupid

202
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,970
and we got married at a mall
and we broke up at a mall

203
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,733
and I...
I haven't been to a mall since.

204
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,102
Why didn't you get divorced?

205
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:46,573
He moved to Hong Kong for
work and I was like...

206
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:47,991
eh, good enough.

207
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,210
Good  enough?
That's not good enough.

208
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:53,321
You order pancakes, you get waffles,
that's good enough.

209
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:56,520
Look, I haven't
seen him in years.

210
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,382
It's just a part of my
life I want to forget.

211
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,681
Just please don't tell
anyone about this.

212
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,392
Okay.

213
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,943
Dude, your hand is monstrous.

214
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,661
Yeah, well, what'd you expect?
You've seen my penis.

215
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:17,930
I can't believe you
told us Robin's secret.

216
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:20,511
What? How could I keep
something like that to myself?

217
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:21,873
And you begged me to tell you.

218
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:23,333
No, I didn't.

219
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:26,380
Please tell us. Just tell us.
I'm begging you.

220
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:28,593
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
Please please please--

221
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:31,093
Fine. Robin's married.

222
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:35,183
Yeah, well,
you still shouldn't have told us.

223
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:37,103
I mean,
what kind of boyfriend are you?

224
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:39,120
See that's just it,
I'm not the boyfriend.

225
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:40,542
I'm the mistress.

226
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:41,991
No, not the mistress.

227
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,490
The mastress.

228
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:45,043
The master.
What do you call it?

229
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,151
Uh, pretty sure we're
going to call it mistress.

230
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:51,350
What am I going to do?
My girlfriend's married.

231
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:52,901
Do I ask her to get a divorce?

232
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:56,083
Ted, even if she is married,
it's a Canadian marriage.

233
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,151
It's like their money,
or their army.

234
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,212
Nobody takes it seriously.

235
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,410
It's serious to me.

236
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,322
You know what, in some countries,
if you been separated

237
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:06,071
for longer than five years,
technically, you're no longer married.

238
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,630
I can check it out at the
law library at school.

239
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:13,562
I can see my hand
print on your face.

240
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:16,291
Don't get too cocky, Slappy.

241
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:19,363
I just got a shipment of porn
from Canada I have to go through.

242
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,370
I won the bet.
Why are you still searching?

243
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,183
Just because you were right
doesn't mean I'm wrong.

244
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:26,541
Oh, right, like you need 
an excuse to watch porn.

245
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,792
Canadian porn.

246
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:31,342
Trust me when I tell you their
universal health care system

247
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,790
doesn't cover breast implants.

248
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,793
If I have to sit through one
more flat-chested Nova Scotian

249
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:39,082
riding a Mountie on
the back of a Zamboni

250
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:41,563
I'll go out of my mind.

251
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:46,350
- Hey.
- Hey.

252
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,552
Listen, dude,
I got to talk to you,

253
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,723
but you got to promise me
that you won't tell Barney.

254
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:54,243
Fine, I won't tell Barney.
What is it?

255
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:58,002
- Robin's not married.
- What?

256
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,500
Why would she tell me she was?

257
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,660
I don't know, but I cross-
checked every record in Canada.

258
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,551
There's no record of
her ever being married.

259
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:04,691
There must be some mistake.

260
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,512
I promise you.
She's not married.

261
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,871
She's not great at
parking legally either.

262
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:12,742
So she lied to me?
W--What am I going to do?

263
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:15,782
I-I can't confront her,
'cause then she'll know I told you.

264
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,071
You got to lawyer her.

265
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:20,631
You got to ask her a bunch of questions,
try to trip her up,

266
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,223
maybe make her feel guilty,
whatever it takes

267
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:24,063
to get a confession out of her.

268
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,401
Thanks for telling
me your secret.

269
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,873
It means so much to me,
that you could be so--

270
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:31,721
God, what's the word
I'm looking for?

271
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:32,881
Honest.

272
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:34,682
Mm, thanks, Ted.

273
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,830
Yeah. You know what's probably
the best part about your honesty?

274
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,700
How truthful it is.

275
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:40,821
I say we just move on.

276
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,970
Well, for me to get total
closure on this whole

277
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,282
"my girlfriend has
a husband" thing,

278
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:47,953
I think I might need a
little bit more information,

279
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:49,892
like what month did
you get married?

280
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:51,742
June. We had a June wedding.

281
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:54,101
Ah, Canada in June.

282
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:55,932
That's the dream.

283
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,770
Sit-down  or buffet?

284
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,551
Well, it's...
weird that you don't remember.

285
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,732
No, I just didn't
know how to answer

286
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:07,692
because we did butlered hors
d'oeuvres in the atrium,

287
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,730
but the actual dinner was
a buffet in the Food Court

288
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:14,133
featuring a filet mignon or a
roasted potato-crusted salmon

289
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:16,872
with a lobster
scallion beurre blanc.

290
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,351
Band or DJ?

291
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,532
A string quartet played
at the ceremony,

292
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:26,541
but for the actual reception,
we had a seven-piece band.

293
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:28,300
We paid extra for the sax

294
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:31,850
'cause I just love that
smooth alto sound.

295
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,541
- How many bridesmaids?
- Seven.

296
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:34,861
- Flowers?
- Azaleas.

297
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:37,162
- Color scheme?
- Dusty rose and sienna.

298
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:38,963
Husband's name.

299
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,200
- You were never married!
- Yes, I was.

300
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:45,140
- No, you weren't.
- How do you know?

301
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:46,541
I looked it up at the library.

302
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:50,131
- What library?
- The one on Fifth.

303
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,050
- When did you go?
- Today at lunch,

304
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:54,100
and I had an apple brie
panini with potato salad...

305
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:56,340
I'm not questioning
the lunch part, Ted.

306
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,951
What database did you use?

307
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:02,692
I used the Canadian
Mall Marriage 6000.

308
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,571
Fine, Marshall looked
it up at school.

309
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,721
- You told Marshall?! 
- You lied to me!

310
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:09,631
See, this is why I don't
tell people secrets.

311
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:12,192
You were supposed to be the
one person I trusted the most

312
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,873
and even you couldn't
keep a secret.

313
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,202
But it was a fake secret.

314
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:17,483
Yeah, I was testing
you and you failed.

315
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,871
And now you're never gonna know
why I don't go to the mall.

316
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,890
And it's good, too.

317
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,793
You  were testing me?
That's insane.

318
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,572
Oh, yeah? How long did it
take for you to tell Marshall

319
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:29,423
my biggest secret in the world?
Five minutes?

320
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:32,292
- That wasn't a real secret!
- Yeah, but it could have been.

321
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:33,650
You are driving me crazy!

322
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,571
No wonder your fake
husband moved to Hong Kong.

323
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,840
He moved there for business.

324
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,581
You.

325
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:42,331
You got something to say to me?

326
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,152
What are you talking about?

327
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,193
I know Robin was
never really married.

328
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:50,120
How could you
possibly know that?

329
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:57,381
And then I put on my
pajamas and got into bed.

330
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,992
How about you?

331
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:02,341
Oh, let's see, uh,
first I took the subway to school.

332
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:03,642
Then I got a bagel.

333
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:06,012
Then I went to the library and
found out Robin was never married.

334
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,142
Crazy.

335
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,252
Then I was hungry again,
so I went down to the vending machine,

336
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:12,422
but by the time I got down there,
I wasn't even hungry anymore.

337
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,800
- You told him?
- I had to.

338
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:18,153
I'm Slap Bet Commissioner.

339
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:21,263
Believe me, this hurts me more
than it's gonna hurt you.

340
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,193
Don't count on it.
I've been practicing on a tree trunk.

341
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:27,711
- Barney gets three slaps.
- Three?

342
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:31,771
One because you lied and two
for being prematurely slapped.

343
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:32,911
Three slaps.

344
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:34,012
But--

345
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,922
Oh, my God.

346
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,462
- Are you gonna cry?
- No.

347
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,471
You're gonna cry.

348
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:49,831
I just don't think it's healthy to
keep big secrets in a relationship.

349
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,752
My parents didn't really talk
to each other for 30 years

350
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:52,863
and now they're divorced.

351
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,671
I have shared more
of myself with you

352
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,781
than I've ever
shared with anyone.

353
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,932
I'm asking for this one secret,

354
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:02,712
which has nothing to do with us,
to just be mine.

355
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,383
So I just got a very
interesting phone call.

356
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:08,813
What are you talking about?

357
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,602
I know Robin's secret.

358
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,231
- What?
- That's right.

359
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,003
I know your secret, Robin.

360
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:17,812
Or should I say Robin Sparkles?

361
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,733
How do you know that name?

362
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:21,623
Because I know the truth,

363
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,210
and I am about to show
it to you right now.

364
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:25,923
Gather 'round, Ted,
you're gonna want to see this.

365
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,383
Yeah, no, I don't.

366
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:28,311
What?

367
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,842
Robin wants to keep
this a secret, so...

368
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:32,620
it's gonna stay a secret.

369
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:35,402
Yeah, it's not
gonna stay a secret.

370
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:36,780
You see, in my research,

371
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:39,170
I came upon a certain
gentleman in Malaysia

372
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,950
who is in possession of
a certain videotape.

373
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,243
He just emailed me that
it will be up and running

374
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:47,762
on My Space in about...
right now.

375
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:52,442
Robin's world is about to
be turned upside-down.

376
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:53,963
I mean, I'm guessing.

377
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:55,113
Barney, don't, okay?

378
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,213
Robin, please don't panic.

379
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:59,240
I'm only gonna show enough to
prove to Marshall I was right.

380
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:01,502
No, Barney,
I said we're not watching this.

381
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:03,302
No, it's time.

382
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:05,162
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

383
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:08,580
but if it's out there, there's no
point in trying to hide it anymore.

384
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:11,373
Let's just watch it
and be done with it.

385
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:13,702
Are you as terrified as I am?

386
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:16,613
I don't want to
get slapped again.

387
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:21,542
I want to stress
that I was young.

388
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:22,750
Yeah, you were.

389
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,120
And I didn't know any better.

390
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:25,683
They never do.

391
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,340
And it started out as an
innocent modeling job.

392
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,373
It always does.

393
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:33,140
Please, Mr. Johnson.

394
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:35,522
I'm sorry I was a bad girl.

395
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:38,190
Please don't give me detention.

396
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:43,132
Isn't there something I can
do to make it up to you?

397
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,620
Oh, my God.

398
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:50,632
Well, obviously,
I've been proven right,

399
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,690
so in the interest
of Robin's dignity,

400
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:53,963
I won't show anymore.

401
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:56,770
Plus, it's getting late.
It's already slap o'clock.

402
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,771
What the hell was that?

403
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,510
Uh, I slap bet Marshall that
you did porn, so I win.

404
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:06,473
Porn? I wish it was porn.
It would be less embarrassing.

405
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:09,040
I know.

406
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:12,693
How about I sing you a song?

407
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:21,872
Let's go to the
mall, everybody!

408
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,140
I was a teenage
pop star in Canada.

409
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,753
# Put on your jelly bracelets #

410
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,803
# And your cool graffiti coat #

411
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:37,442
# At the mall, having fun #

412
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,502
# Is what it's all about #

413
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:43,841
This is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

414
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,753
- That's you?
- Yes.

415
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,600
I had one minor hit.

416
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:51,622
I had to go all over Canada
and sing this song in malls.

417
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:55,791
For a whole year, I lived off of
Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.

418
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:59,440
# Everybody come and play #

419
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:03,640
# Throw every last care away #

420
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:06,920
# Let's go to the mall #

421
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,923
# Today #

422
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:13,033
If this is the '90s,
why does it look like 1986?

423
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:16,782
The '80s didn't come to Canada till,
like, '93.

424
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:21,631
Taking a break from the first of many,
many viewings,

425
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:24,201
I can't help but notice
that this isn't porn.

426
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:27,010
And yet,
a slap occurred without the permission

427
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:29,051
of the Slap Bet Commissioner.

428
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:32,740
Looks like somebody suffered
from premature slapulation.

429
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,261
Oh, my God, Robin's rapping.

430
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,582
Guys, Robin's rapping.

431
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,440
# Went to the mall with #
# a couple of friends #

432
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,783
# I had a whole week's #
# allowance to spend #

433
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:42,063
Okay, I'm going to
give you a choice.

434
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:44,703
Either ten slaps
right now in a row,

435
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:47,243
or five slaps that
can be doled out

436
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,802
at any point from
here to eternity.

437
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:52,230
You go with the ten now.

438
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:54,210
No way,
why get ten when you can get five?

439
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:56,243
Yeah, but the constant fear of
knowing that at any moment,

440
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,000
you could get slapped in the face,
would drive you crazy.

441
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,650
I'm going to go with
the five for eternity.

442
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,271
- Good call.
- Horrible call.

443
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:06,203
Relax, dude,
I'm just going for my soda, man.

444
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:07,093
Take it easy.

445
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:09,032
This is going to be fun.

446
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,081
# Let's go to the mall #

447
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,783
# Let's go to the mall #

448
00:19:14,796 --> 00:19:16,483
# Today #

449
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,673
So just to be clear,

450
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:22,773
you wanted everybody to
go to the mall today?

451
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,763
Wow, we're going to
watch this a lot.

452
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:30,093
I can't believe I ever wore
a Bedazzled jean jacket.

453
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:31,713
Hey, just so you know,

454
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:34,410
16-year-old me would
have been all over you.

455
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:37,581
You could have been the girlfriend
in Canada I told everyone I had.

456
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:40,412
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry
I pried this out of you.

457
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:42,331
I probably should
have left it alone.

458
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:44,292
You know what?

459
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:46,112
You know me better now.

460
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,770
That feels kind of nice.

461
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,911
That's one.

462
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:05,020
# Everybody come and play #

463
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:08,593
# Throw every last care away #

464
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,472
Wow.

465
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:12,410
# Let's go to the mall #

466
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:14,183
# Today #

467
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:15,823
Did you have to laugh
like that every time?

468
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:17,213
Yes.

469
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:19,522
# This boy I like #

470
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:21,350
# Met him at the food court #

471
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:22,852
# He's got hair like Gretzky #

472
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,403
# And he does jumps #
# on his skateboard #

473
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:27,511
# I hope he asks me out #

474
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,392
# Take me to my favorite spot #

475
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:31,030
# It'll be just him and me #

476
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:34,153
# But don't forget the robot #

477
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,560
The robot. Hey!

478
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:40,613
# But, baby #
# I don't want to wait #

479
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:41,351
# Let's do it #

480
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,941
No, she doesn't want to wait.

481
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,892
# I'm gonna rock #
# your body anyway #

482
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:47,543
# I'm gonna rock your #
# body till Canada Day #

483
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:53,010
# Everybody come and play #

484
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:56,850
# Throw every last care away #

485
00:20:56,868 --> 00:21:00,433
