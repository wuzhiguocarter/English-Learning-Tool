1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,259
This is awesome.

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:05,782
I can't believe this
moment's finally here.

3
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:09,327
One more mile and my
little boy turns 200,000.

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:12,718
Your baby Fiero's grown into
a really old man Fiero.

5
00:00:12,748 --> 00:00:14,255
And just like an old man,

6
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,158
he leaks fluid, smells stale,

7
00:00:16,188 --> 00:00:17,801
makes weird noises
out the back.

8
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:18,970
Yeah, he does.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,177
Hey, light up those cigars
in the glove compartment.

10
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:23,980
They're real Cubans.
I got 'em in Chinatown last year

11
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:25,200
just for this moment.

12
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:28,173
Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying
you were definitely ripped off,

13
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:31,569
but these are chopsticks
wrapped in napkins.

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,133
- What are you talking about?
- Whoa, pothole.

15
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,621
What? No. Oh. No.

16
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:37,161
No, no, no.

17
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:39,770
No, there's only .8 miles to go.
Come on, buddy.

18
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:40,960
Buddy!

19
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:48,613
Is it cool if I
still light these?

00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,523

22
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:08,321
Kids, sometimes life forces us to
be someone we didn't want to be.

23
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:12,211
When that happens, we often try to hold
on to a little piece of who we were.

24
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:13,962
Maybe a tattoo.

25
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:16,263
Or a piece of jewelry.

26
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:19,701
A tiny souvenir that reminds us,
"This is who I really am."

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,561
Marshall's souvenir
was not so tiny,

28
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,513
but the more he found himself being
pushed toward the corporate world

29
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:28,041
and away from his dream of
saving the environment,

30
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,580
the tighter he held
on to that Fiero.

31
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,753
Hey.

32
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:34,921
One good thing: we're off the
hook for the folding party today.

33
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:38,401
Hey. It's very important
to both Lily and me

34
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:42,071
that there be a handmade origami
crane in each of our wedding's...

35
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,042
I couldn't even get through it.
Thank God.

36
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:46,931
Hey, your car's
going to be fine.

37
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,961
This is the best
auto shop around.

38
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,653
Look at this certificate.

39
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,501
One of the mechanics here

40
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:55,152
finished a 64-ounce steak.

41
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,202
Surprise.

42
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:58,951
We felt bad that you
guys were missing

43
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,751
the super-fun origami
folding party, so...

44
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,261
we suggested moving it here.

45
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:04,803
We insisted.

46
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:06,343
Terrific.

47
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:08,163
How's the Fiero?

48
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,080
She's still in triage.

49
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:12,502
She? I thought it
was your little boy.

50
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:15,833
Oh, it goes back and forth.
It's sort of a tranny car.

51
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:19,310
How long have you had her...
slash him?

52
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:22,341
My brothers handed it
down to me when I was 16.

53
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:23,831
Oh, how nice of them.

54
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,322
Not really.

55
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,281
Congratulations.

56
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,083
The Fiero is yours.

57
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:33,810
If you pass the final test.

58
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,190
Come on!

59
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:38,741
I already shaved my legs and
swallowed five dollars in quarters.

60
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:40,761
Only $4.50 has come out.

61
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:43,961
Just go to the
Weinerburger drive-thru

62
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,853
and get us 12 cups of coffee.

63
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:48,221
- That's it?
- Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,223
But we get to decide
what you wear.

65
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:54,621
Agreed. Totally agreed.

66
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,570
You're naked.

67
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:02,322
I'm aware of that.

68
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,753
You have 50 cents?

69
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:10,451
No...

70
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:13,761
Look,  can I just have
my coffee, please?

71
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:16,252
Sorry, we're all out
of trays and lids.

72
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:19,661
Two tall guys just came through here
a few minutes ago and bought 'em all.

73
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,630
And that is the origin
of Marshall's insane

74
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,392
"no food or drinks in the Fiero,
not even groceries" rule.

75
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,071
It is not insane.

76
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:48,062
Barney. That's like the third one
in a row that you've screwed up.

77
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,972
Well, I'm trying, but it's...

78
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:53,441
Look. You fold twice to the middle,
fold back and forth, pull the ends out,

79
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:57,443
flip over, open the flaps, fold the
edges, crease the front, fold in half,

80
00:03:57,476 --> 00:04:00,470
fold the wings down, push in the bottom
corners, and fold the wings back out.

81
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,732
Or would you like one of my
kindergartners to show you?

82
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:06,703
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, I think I've got it.

83
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:09,352
No.

84
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:12,632
Forget it; the paper's too expensive.
You're out.

85
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,352
Aw, nerts.

86
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:20,393
The food rule is insane.
We could have died because of it.

87
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,443
- Remember the 100K fiasco?
- Ah, the Fiero-asco.

88
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:26,953
Dude, I told you that doesn't work.
It's the 100K fiasco.

89
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:29,491
- What's the 100K fiasco?
- The Fiero-asco?

90
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:32,312
It was just before winter break
our freshman year of college.

91
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,832
Marshall and I were roommates,
but we weren't really good friends yet.

92
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:37,363
I thought Ted was a
little bit pretentious.

93
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:39,881
And Marshall was a total slob.

94
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:41,823
Hey.

95
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:45,441
I'm driving my Fiero
back over break.

96
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:47,563
I know we see enough of
each other as it is,

97
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:50,251
but if you want a ride,
I could use the gas money.

98
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:53,271
You live in Ohio, right?
I could swing through and pick you up.

99
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:56,773
All right, first of all,
my parents live in Ohio.

100
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:58,901
I live in the moment.

101
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:02,382
Plus, Karen and I haven't seen
each other since Thanksgiving.

102
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:06,460
We're both really invested in making
this long-distance thing work, so...

103
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:08,701
All right, well,
call me if you change your mind.

104
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,793
My odometer's
going to hit 100K.

105
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,863
She'd be so bummed
if I left early.

106
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,493
It was totally mutual.

107
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,693
I mean, Karen brought it up first,
but I...

108
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:23,261
it was...
it was totally mutual.

109
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,152
I hear you.

110
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:28,070
So what's up with you and Lily?
Anything serious?

111
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,420
Yeah.

112
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,121
Dude, we're college freshmen.

113
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:33,830
I'm not going to get tied down by
the first chick I hook up with.

114
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,851
Lily's cool, but this bird
you'll never chain, you know?

115
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,621
The next few hours of our
drive were classic road trip.

116
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,502
So... this song.

117
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,471
Oh, it's the best
song in the world.

118
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:58,401
It's the only song I like.

119
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,603
Just kidding.

120
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,333
Tape's been stuck in the player for,
like, two years.

121
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,971
Better than nothing, though.

122
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,021
Maybe.

123
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:21,090
I am so... sick...
of this song.

124
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:23,011
Don't worry.
It comes around again.

125
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:24,652
What do you mean?

126
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:28,983
# Just to be the man
who walks 1,000 miles #

127
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:34,611
# And falls down
at your door... #

128
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,791
Yeah, we totally
nailed the ending.

129
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,460
That was probably our best one.

130
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,631
Hey, you want to 
play Zitch Dog?

131
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,261
- What?
- Uh, it's a car game.

132
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:46,682
Every time you see a dog, you got to
be the first one to say, "Zitch dog."

133
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,380
- I'm pretty good, so...
- Zitch dog.

134
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,982
Well, no, I didn't know we had...
we'd started, but...

135
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,143
Okay, that's cool.
You got the first point.

136
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,440
- Zitch dog.
- Zitch dog. Damn it!

137
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,872
Are we still playing?
'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...

138
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,041
12-nothing.

139
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:04,673
Marshall.

140
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:10,943
-  Marshall.
- Zitch dog, blue Suburban.

141
00:07:10,976 --> 00:07:12,013
Damn it!

142
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:13,560
18-nothing.

143
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,080
Then Marshall,
who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog,

144
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,500
got us totally lost.

145
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,983
Where the hell are we?!

146
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

147
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,431
I think you skipped something.

148
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:27,062
Really? Seems impossible.

149
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,342
Hey, we got some time.

150
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,562
What do you say we get off the highway,
take the road less traveled, you know?

151
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:36,460
Robert Frost.

152
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,311
Doesn't seem like a smart idea.

153
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,381
Too late.

154
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,101
I'm taking this exit.

155
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:45,450
Who's not fun
enough now, Karen?

156
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,292
Then we got lost.

157
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:51,030
Where the hell are we?!

158
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,510
- I'm pulling over.
- No, keep driving.

159
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:56,300
We're almost out of gas, and we
might not even be on a road anymore.

160
00:07:56,337 --> 00:07:59,643
It's below zero out. If we pull over,
we could be snowed in for days.

161
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:02,503
Plus, I only have, like, six granola
bars and three bottles of water.

162
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,093
- Nah, I threw them out.
- What?!

163
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:07,543
No food or drink in the Fiero.

164
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:12,073
No food or drink in the F...? You
haven't washed your sheets since...

165
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,920
Thus began the longest
night of our lives.

166
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,371
Pretty sure that my
foot is frozen solid.

167
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,142
Marshall...

168
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:28,600
there's a very real chance that we're
gonna be snowed in here for days.

169
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:32,520
If I die first,
do whatever you need to survive.

170
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:33,730
Eat my flesh.

171
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,293
Slice me open like a
tauntaun, whatever.

172
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,463
Thanks, Ted.

173
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,732
You're a good friend.

174
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:45,232
And if I die first,
you just leave my body alone.

175
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,223
What?

176
00:08:46,256 --> 00:08:48,442
I just said you could cut me
open and crawl inside me.

177
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:51,012
Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me;
it skeeves me out.

178
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:54,110
But... but you're dead,
and I'm gonna die if I don't.

179
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:56,142
Wasn't an easy decision.

180
00:08:57,076 --> 00:09:00,091
This is all because of
your insane no-food rule.

181
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,593
It's perfectly rational.

182
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:09,383
Hey! My spectacles!

183
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:15,592
Hey.

184
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,913
I know we're low on gas,

185
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:22,850
but can we turn on the
heat for just a minute?

186
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:25,673
Okay.

187
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,962
D ude...

188
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:39,572
I hate to say this...

189
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,743
but it's so cold...

190
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:46,703
there's only one way that we're
gonna make it through this night.

191
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:55,503
- We should've kept driving.
- Come on, Marshall.

192
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:58,743
No. No. We might die now.

193
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,500
I may never see Lily again.

194
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:04,633
I never told
anybody this, but...

195
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,361
I've known for a long time that
I'm gonna marry that girl.

196
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,292
If we survive this,
someday I'm gonna marry her.

197
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,883
I'm sorry about
your spectacles.

198
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,840
That's okay.

199
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:21,412
They were decorative.

200
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:28,562
Hey, Marshall.

201
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:29,983
Y eah?

202
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:33,273
Are you still
thinking about Lily?

203
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,962
Yeah.

204
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:37,122
Please stop. 

205
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:44,092
And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna
die out there in the middle of nowhere.

206
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,321
But funny thing...

207
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:58,640
Hey. You lovers better
just keep on driving.

208
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:02,533
- Zitch dog!
- Damn it!

209
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:07,233
You said you were gonna
marry me that long ago?

210
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,083
That is so sweet.

211
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:11,782
That trip is when Marshall
and I became best friends.

212
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,361
With privileges,
from the sound of it.

213
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:17,260
E riksen.

214
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:39,323
Wow.

215
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:41,750
Looks like he
really needs a hug.

216
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:44,332
Ted.

217
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:55,521
He said it would be at least
3,000 bucks to make it run again.

218
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:58,123
And even then,
there's no guarantee.

219
00:11:58,258 --> 00:11:59,831
Well, it's a pretty old car.

220
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,462
Yeah. You can keep
prolonging its life,

221
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:05,692
but it's really mostly
machine at this point.

222
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:09,261
I know that it's
a lot of money,

223
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,753
but it's my Fiero, you know?

224
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:15,593
I'm about to graduate and take
some sellout corporate law job,

225
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:18,302
and without that Fiero,
I'm just another guy in a suit.

226
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,922
- How dare you...
- Hey.

227
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,462
I've been through so
much in that car.

228
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,053
The suicidal cat.

229
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,571
Hitchhiking Waldo.

230
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,863
The homeless guy who broke
in through the window

231
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:39,322
and threw up all
over the backseat.

232
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,472
Lily, don't.

233
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:42,682
Be strong. Do not go all
"prisoner's dilemma" on me.

234
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:45,573
The car's on its deathbed, Robin.
I have to clear my conscience.

235
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,040
Guys, what are
you talking about?

236
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:51,151
Okay. Shortly
after we met Robin,

237
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:54,290
she and I were jonesing for
Thai food from this one place.

238
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:57,231
An hour and a half delivery.
We can't wait that long.

239
00:12:57,268 --> 00:13:01,653
I wish we could take the Fiero, but
Marshall has this insane no-food rule.

240
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,320
But Thai food, Lily.

241
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:05,000
Pad Yum Mao.

242
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:06,820
Tom Kai Gah.

243
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:08,503
Thai See Ran.

244
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:12,343
Oh! You're just saying random syllables,
and it still sounds delicious.

245
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:14,561
Okay. Here's what we'll do.

246
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:18,141
We'll drive over, pick it up,
have them double-bag it,

247
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:21,950
very carefully drive it back
here with the windows open,

248
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,700
and he'll never know.

249
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,211
Wow, these brakes
are really sensitive.

250
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:28,622
Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me!

251
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:31,992
This and the difference between "affect"
and "effect" are the only two things

252
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:33,651
he's really serious about.

253
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,521
- Lily, it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not.

254
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:38,103
Marshall's gonna freak.
Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do?

255
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:39,362
- Oh, God, oh...!
- Shut up!

256
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,541
Now, listen to me.
The clock is ticking.

257
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:45,143
Okay, first thing, we scoop up all
these little pieces of tofu and cabbage.

258
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:47,552
Next, what we need to take care
of are the really messy parts--

259
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:50,260
the pools that have collected.
We got to soak that soup up.

260
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:53,143
Last is the smell.
We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai.

261
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,382
You mentioned cigars.

262
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:56,611
There's two in the glove compartment,
but he's been saving them.

263
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:58,201
Hand me those chopsticks.

264
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,461
Hey, how about some tunes?

265
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,932
Oh, great song.

266
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:13,612
These cigars aren't
helping at all.

267
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,071
Yeah. This was a terrible idea.

268
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:21,793
Now it just smells like a
homeless guy threw up in here.

269
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,821
The broken windows?

270
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:27,422
We had to make it
look realistic.

271
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:29,413
Why did you break two of them?

272
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:33,032
It looked like fun when she did it.
So I wanted to try.

273
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,150
Can't believe this whole
time it was you guys.

274
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:38,801
I've been blaming really
tanned dancing leotard guy.

275
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:42,312
Marshall, I'm so sorry,
but sharing that secret--

276
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:45,092
that's when Robin and
I became best friends.

277
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,802
Wow. What a special car.

278
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,033
So, can I crush it into
a little cube yet?

279
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,180
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

280
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:53,540
Come on, Marshall.

281
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,112
This is your Fiero.

282
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:57,141
You know the right
thing to do here.

283
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:59,822
Wow, Barney,
why do you love that car so much?

284
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,301
Love it?

285
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,152
Hold on a second.

286
00:15:03,976 --> 00:15:05,413
Love it?

287
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,451
I hate it!

288
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,741
What? Why?

289
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:12,620
Why? Why?

290
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,573
Why?!

291
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:18,191
- Why?!
- Let me tell it.

292
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:21,051
It was last year during
the transit strike.

293
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:24,021
Uh, is Marshall around?

295
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,783
I have a massage in Queens in
half an hour. I need a ride.

296
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:29,320
Uh, no, he's at the library all day.
Just take the keys.

297
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,053
Hey! Why don't you drive me?

298
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:34,762
It'll be like a
total road trip.

299
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:36,030
To Queens?

300
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:39,482
Yeah, we'll get,
we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.

301
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:42,051
Uh, actually I have a
lot of work to do, so.

302
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:45,113
Okay. Well, anyway,
I'll cancel.

303
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,821
- See you later.
- Wait!

304
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:50,452
You know how to drive, right?

305
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:54,092
What, of course I know how to drive.
I love driving.

306
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:55,981
Hitting the road.

307
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,251
Cruising the lanes.

308
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,232
And braking.

309
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,190
Honking. Love it.

310
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,741
Except for lady drivers.

311
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:07,571
Don't get me started
on lady drivers.

312
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,490
- Which pedal's the gas?
- Trick question.

313
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:10,410
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

314
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,642
- No, it's not.
- Middle, left, right?

315
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,222
I never learned how to drive!

316
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,640
I grew up in the city.
I never had a chance.

317
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,692
Well, guess what?

318
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,991
You're getting your chance.
Because I'm going to teach you.

319
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,701
Barney Stinson, buckle up.

320
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,621
This isn't right.

321
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,593
God never meant for us to travel
at such breakneck speeds.

322
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:34,241
Relax. You're doing great.

323
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:37,200
Ignore the old lady on the rascal;
this isn't a race.

324
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:40,530
Dude, a dog.

325
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,682
Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.

326
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:45,062
What do I do?
Tell me what to do, Ted.

327
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:47,961
Step on the brakes.
Sometime in the next 20 minutes.

328
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:49,641
Which? Which one's
the break again?

329
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:51,723
- The left one.
- Left. Oh, man, left.

330
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,601
- I'm totally blanking.
- Make the Ls.

331
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,412
Oh, we're not going to make it.

332
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:58,791
Why did you just
turn on the radio?

333
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,263
I don't know why I
turned on the radio!

334
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:02,140
We're going to die.
Tell me what to do, Ted.

335
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:03,540
Relax. You're being crazy.

336
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,812
- Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.
- Stop, drop and roll.

337
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:12,560
Screaming is fun!
Screaming is fun!

338
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,423
I can't move.

339
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:26,322
I can't... I can't feel my...

340
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:28,023
Wait.

341
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:30,413
Wait.

342
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:35,883
We're okay.

343
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:37,751
- We're okay.
- We're okay.

344
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:40,033
It's a miracle, Ted!

345
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:45,023
Wow. Sounds like you had
some accident in that car.

346
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:47,503
Actually, he had two accidents
if you add the fact that he...

347
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,710

ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina
ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina.

348
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:54,451
I shouldn't even be here,
thanks to that deathtrap.

349
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:55,900
But fate...

350
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,443
fate gave me a second chance.

351
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:02,670
And helped me realize that our days on
this planet are too few to squander.

352
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:05,763
So I decided from
that moment on

353
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,781
to continue living
life to its fullest.

354
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:14,370
So you made a life-changing decision
to not change your life at all.

355
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:15,761
True story.

356
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,100
Guys.

357
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,542
This Fiero's meant
a lot to all of us.

358
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,320
Friendships were made.

359
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:25,032
Adventures had. Horrors faced.

360
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:28,563
That's why we have
to get rid of it.

361
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:29,840
- Yes!
- What?

362
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:33,252
It's lived a great life and it
deserves to die with dignity.

363
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:34,883
But 200,000...

364
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,421
But that's life. You know?

365
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,873
You never end up where you
thought you wanted to be.

366
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,473
I'm not helping
the environment.

367
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:43,033
Ted's not a philosopher.

368
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,692
Lily's not not a
world-famous artist.

369
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,563
Barney's never driven more
than ten miles an hour.

370
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:51,200
Robin, I'm sure, has also experienced
disappointment in her life.

371
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:52,173
Maybe?

372
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:56,273
And my Fiero's not a Fiero
that went 200,000 miles.

373
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,553
It's okay. You know?

374
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,481
Those are old dreams.

375
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:06,443
We'll get a new car and we'll fill
that one up with new memories.

376
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:09,373
And that'll be the car we had
when we were first married.

377
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:11,702
When we owned our first house.

378
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:14,650
Maybe even the first car
our four kids remember.

379
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,740
That's so sweet.

380
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:19,542
The first car our
two kids remember.

381
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:23,573
I would like to say good-bye.

382
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,273
You know what?


383
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:45,411
This Fiero,
it's effected all our lives.

384
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:46,671
- Affected.
- That's what I said.

385
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:48,083
Just making sure.

386
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,090
Got us all a lot of places.

387
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,383
I mean maybe it's time
we return the favor.

388
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:54,810
This Fiero should have
made it to 200,000.

389
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,742
So, let's get it out that door.

390
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,951
And we'll push it
the last .7 miles.

391
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,752
It'd do the same for us. 

392
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:19,740
Hey, geniuses.

393
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:23,143
The back wheels are on blocks.
That car ain't going anywhere.

394
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:28,512
- Close enough!
- Close enough!

395
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,803
And so Marshall said
good-bye to his Fiero.

396
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,893
And as the car's
final gift to us all,

397
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:37,970
the money he got for scrap parts paid
our bar tab for the next two nights.

398
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,743
Arrivederci, Fiero!

399
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:42,310
You  were the freaking
giving tree of cars.

400
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,211
May you rust in peace.

401
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,803
Rot in hell, devil steed.

402
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,783
And what better friend
is there than that?

403
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,843
Bro. Have you heard
this new song?

404
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,380
I just got the cassingle.

405
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,553
Put it in.

406
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:05,991
I am never going to
get sick of this song.

407
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:09,081
Never, ever, never,
never, ever.

408
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:10,872
Yeah!

409
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:14,563
