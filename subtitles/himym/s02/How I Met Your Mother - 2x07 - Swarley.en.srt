1
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:12,258
- So, I guess that decides it.
- Yup.

2
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,704
Hanging out at a coffee place

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,447
is not nearly as much fun
as hanging out at a bar.

4
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:19,872
Man, what's that?

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,382
What?

6
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:25,260
That cute coffee girl
wrote a heart by your name.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,825
Somebody has a crush on you.

8
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,804
Somebody thinks you're me.

9
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,451
Do you really
think she likes me?

10
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:35,340
I mean, I guess 
it's not that surprising.

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,076
Every time I come in here,
I totally crack her up.

12
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:40,099
Marshall, here's
your pumpkin latte.

13
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,263
Wow. How did you fit a
pumpkin in this little cup?

14
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,563
I'll have a pumpkin latte.

15
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:50,021
How do they even fit a
pumpkin in those little cups?

16
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:51,991
What? You got a shrink
ray back there?

17
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:53,811
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,862
Hey, remember that
time I said that thing

19
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,732
about how do they fit a
pumpkin into that little cup?

20
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:01,532
- Which time?
- The first time.

21
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,491
Yeah. That was really funny.

22
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:05,590
Right.

23
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:07,533
All right, there's only two
reasons she'd laugh at that.

24
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,973
One, it's the first
joke she's ever heard,

25
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,911
or two, she likes you.
You should totally ask her out.

26
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:13,521
You think?

27
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:15,033
Yeah, that why you're not
back with Lily, right?

28
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,510
So you can experience what
it's like to be single.

29
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:19,990
Well, what if the heart
doesn't mean anything?

30
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:22,001
What if she writes
it on all the cups?

31
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:24,063
Mine says "Ted," no heart.

32
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:27,092
Mine says... "Swarley."

33
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:30,093
How'd they get
"Swarley" from "Barney"?

34
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,190
It's not even a name.

35
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:33,300
Who would ever be
called "Swarley"?

36
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:38,243
Oh, please don't start
calling me "Swarley."

37
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:42,661
This would never
happen at a bar!

38
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:46,731
Man! What's up with Swarley?

39
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:49,633
I know. You almost never see
old Swarlz get that upset.

40
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,802
Hey, guess what?

41
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:08,743
Oh, sorry.

42
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:09,783
It's only my mom.

43
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,933
She's just rambling
on like always.

44
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:13,702
What happened?

45
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,081
Marshall asked out a girl.

46
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:16,101
Wow.

47
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:18,103
Well, if anything,
that's Dad's fault.

48
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,080
That'll keep her going a while.

49
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,543
Oh, of course, you know,
he had a little help.

50
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:23,632
Swarley hooked him up?

51
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:24,730
Oh, good. You got my text.

52
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,413
- Yeah.
- Oh. No, it was me.

53
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,342
I gave Marshall
one of my secrets.

54
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,143
- So, what she say?
- Nothing.

55
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,832
I don't think she heard me.
It's pretty busy up there.

56
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,633
What? You gave her
the look right?

57
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,570
Head down, eyes looking up,

58
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,712
hands in pockets, shoulders up,

59
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:43,642
head slightly tilted,
conveying shy vulnerability.

60
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:45,952
I think so.

61
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,502
Look, can we just go?

62
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:56,212
Pumpkin latte for Marshall.

63
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,390
I didn't order that.

64
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:08,112
Phone number.

65
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,410
I love that look.

66
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:13,130
I think I slept with you
because of that look.

67
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,263
And it's fake?

68
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:16,793
Oh, and you biting your lower lip,
shyly looking away

69
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:19,330
and thrusting your
chest out is natural?

70
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:21,012
Yeah, I hear you.

71
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,720
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

72
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,741
Are you free tomorrow night?

73
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,830
I was thinking of having
a wine tasting slash

74
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,293
"help me catch the rat
in my apartment" party.

75
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:32,990
That's a great idea.
You can put out cheese for both.

76
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,883
I should invite
Marshall, right?

77
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:37,223
It'd be weird if I didn't.

78
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:39,290
Yeah, I don't think he can go.

79
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,901
Really? Why not?

80
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:43,242
Uh, okay, um...

81
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:45,480
Lily, we have to
tell you something.

82
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:47,363
Marshall has a date.

83
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,780
Oh. Well... good for him.

84
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,141
Really? You're okay with it?

85
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,091
Look, we've been broken
up almost six months.

86
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,333
I mean,
I'm not thrilled about the idea,

87
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:59,493
but he has every right
to date someone else.

88
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,453
That's very mature.

89
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:03,122
Why are you holding the phone?

90
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:04,843
Oh, shoot.

91
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,693
That's hilarious, Mom.

92
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:10,833
Didn't even notice.

93
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:15,022
Hey, dude, by the way,
I really like that suit.

94
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,220
Tell me about the fabric.
Is it foreign or something?

95
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,161
Wow. It is foreign.
I'm impressed, Ted.

96
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,620
- It's Moroccan, actually.
- Whoa.

97
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,132
I got a call for Swarley.

98
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,282
Is there a Swarley here?

99
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:28,342
You weren't interested in
my suit at all, were you?

100
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,512
- Hmm?
- Swarley!

101
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,843
Yeah, I know he's there.
It's really important.

102
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,350
Could you ask again?

103
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,441
Important call for Swarley!

104
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,912
Geez,  can't you hear him, Swarley?
There's a call for you.

105
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,413
Stop calling me that.

106
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:45,961
Uh...  Hey, I'd like you guys
to officially meet Chloe.

107
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:46,962
- Hi.
- Hi.

108
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:47,863
Hi.

109
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:49,393
It's nice to meet you guys.

110
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,713
- I'll be right back.
- It's right back there.

111
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:58,381
Right? Right? She's hot!

112
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,860
And she likes me?

113
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:03,160
She likes Italian food.
I also like Italian food.

114
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,593
She likes Billy Joel.
I also like... music.

115
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,553
And I think we're
going to go out again.

116
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,130
- Dude, you gotta ditch her.
- Obviously.

117
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:13,523
Why?

118
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:14,833
She's got the crazy eyes.

119
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,791
Dude. The eyes.

120
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,492
They're crazy.

121
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,502
What are you guys talking about,
the crazy eyes?

122
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:24,583
It's a well-documented condition
of the pupils, or pupi.

123
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:25,860
No. Just pupils.

124
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:29,343
It's an indicator of
future mental instability.

125
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:32,100
She does not have
the crazy eyes.

126
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:33,822
You just can't see it
because you're afflicted

127
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,731
with "haven't been laid
in a while" blindness.

128
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,600
She was too far away
in the coffee place,

129
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:41,523
but when I saw her
up close just now...

130
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,523
Hey, I'd like you guys to
officially meet Chloe.

131
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,623
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,582
Hi.

133
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:47,362
It's nice to meet you guys.

134
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,551
You guys,
I'm not going to stop dating Chloe

135
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:57,040
just because you think
she has the crazy eyes.

136
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,100
You can keep going out with her,
but you're gonna regret it.

137
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,560
One time,
I met a girl at this very bar.

138
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:04,651
I saw that she had
the crazy eyes...

139
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:07,830
...but I ignored it.

140
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,183
And then, sure enough.

141
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,922
Barney, can I ask
you a question?

142
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:14,413
Anything.

143
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,430
Would you like to
have a threesome?

144
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,086
Of course.

145
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:21,859
Great. It'll be you,
me and Mr. Weasels.

146
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,703
So, did you do it?

147
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,211
No. It ended up
being just a twosome

148
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,580
with the third one
watching from a chair.

149
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,621
Which one were you?

150
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,200
I'd rather not say.

151
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:38,062
Look, there was a time I didn't
believe in the crazy eyes either,

152
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,010
and then I met Jeanine.

153
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,773
She had serious crazy eyes.

154
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:46,663
I told myself I was 
just imagining it, but then...

155
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,440
So, should we go get a drink?

156
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:50,860
As long as it's in
your apartment.

157
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,180
Whoa, I'm sorry.

158
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:58,100
Watch! Where! You're! Going!

159
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:02,192
So, where do you live?

160
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,832
You guys, Chloe is not 
gonna do any of that stuff.

161
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,642
She's a nice girl
from Nebraska.

162
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:08,851
She's not crazy.

163
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:11,021
She's... she's awesome.

164
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:13,243
But you can't avoid
the crazy eyes forever.

165
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:16,180
Sooner or later, the crazy 
comes bubbling to the surface.

166
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:16,980
Hello?

167
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:18,621
Marshall, it's Chloe.

168
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,233
Are you the one who's
called me like nine times?

169
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:23,340
Yeah. Could you come get me?

170
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,801
I'm in the middle
of taking a test.

171
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:27,772
Please.  I'm so scared.

172
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,430
Well, what's going on?

173
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,463
This weird midget guy
started following me

174
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:32,650
and he was screaming at me

175
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,891
and he had a limp and
a big hump on his back

176
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:36,300
and the police
didn't believe me

177
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:39,150
and I almost got trampled
by a horse and...

178
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:42,041
God I must sound totally
crazy to you right now.

179
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:45,010
No. Pfft.

180
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,301
Not at all.

181
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:48,650
So, she's needy crazy.

182
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,440
That's one of the worst kinds.

183
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,760
I've had one of those.

184
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,461
Makes up stories
to get attention.

185
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:56,662
Went out with her for three weeks--
her dad died twice.

186
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,511
Guys, she was really
freaked out, okay?

187
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,083
Maybe the story is true.

188
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:03,833
What in the world would make
you believe that's a true story?

189
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,370
She's really hot.

190
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,690
They always are.

191
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,600
- You all done with that, Ted?
- Yeah.

192
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,313
Ned. I told you
to call him Ned.

193
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:16,322
That's just sad.

194
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:18,102
Sorry, Swarley.

195
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,831
So, do just you
and Ted live here

196
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,610
or does Swarley live here, too?

197
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,553
Nah. Swarley has his own place.

198
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:30,941
What was that?

199
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,672
Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.

200
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:36,562
So, here you go.

201
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:39,010
Two pumpkin beers.

202
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,881
I was joking.
They're regular beers.

203
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,403
What is that?

204
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:55,191
This picture is broken.

205
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,103
Oh. That's too bad.

206
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:59,920
Is that Lily?

207
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:02,221
Is  that the girl you
were going to marry?

208
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:04,393
Yeah. Is that what
that sound was?

209
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,633
Did you just smash this?

210
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:07,932
No.

211
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,220
Why would I do that?

212
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:13,562
Let me look into your eyes.

213
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,730
Okay.

214
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,300
I had a really
nice time tonight.

215
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:23,592
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

216
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:27,373
I like your eyes a lot, too.

217
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,642
Stop!

218
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,893
Hi. I'm Lily.

219
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:42,122
Stop!

220
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:44,223
Now, kids,
I know Lily hiding in the apartment

221
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:47,522
while Marshall was on a date with
another girl seems pretty crazy,

222
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,880
but when you hear her
side of the story,

223
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,950
well, it's still pretty crazy.

224
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,182
What's up Swarlz?

225
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,400
No. Okay? No. No more.

226
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,470
I will not let this 
become a thing. It's over.

227
00:09:58,488 --> 00:10:00,450
No more Swarley. No Swarlz.

228
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,941
No more Swar-lay.

229
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:05,922
No  more Swar...
wait for it... ley.

230
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,510
No more Bob Swarley, mon.

231
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:11,470
No more. No! It's over.

232
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,061
Do you understand?

233
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:13,901
- Yes.
- Yes.

234
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,412
Thank you.

235
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,000
Nice.

236
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,192
- Why didn't you call me?
- Was I supposed to call you?

237
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,462
Yes, about the whole Marshall-
dating-another-girl thing.

238
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:25,590
You said you were fine with it.

239
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,623
Yeah, in front of Ted,
but then I shot you a look.

240
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:30,972
- What look?
- This.

241
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,510
That doesn't seem like a look.

242
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,102
Yes it is. It means, 
"I'm upset call me later."

243
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,382
You should have pulled me aside
and told me what the look meant.

244
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:41,263
If I pulled you aside,
I wouldn't need the look.

245
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,523
Well, maybe if it was a
more distinctive look...

246
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,391
Okay, the look isn't important.

247
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:47,470
What's important is that
I can't stand the idea

248
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:49,220
of Marshall dating
another woman.

249
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,700
I mean, what if 
he falls in love with her?

250
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,493
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

251
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:56,050
Ted says she has
the crazy eyes.

252
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:56,782
What's that?

253
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:59,173
Apparently, a thing women
have that guys can see

254
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:01,061
and it tells them that
the girl's crazy.

255
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,752
Oh, kind of like how you
never want to date a guy

256
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,122
with perfect fingernails?

257
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:07,001
Jerk nails. Exactly.

258
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:10,330
Well, did-did Ted say
whether she was good-looking?

259
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:11,911
I mean,
'cause if I knew she was ugly,

260
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,023
then maybe I wouldn't
be so freaked out.

261
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,290
Uh, he didn't say,
but you can find out.

262
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:19,811
I think her name is Chloe--
she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.

263
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:23,242
Phone call for Swarles Barkley?

264
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,802
Hey, Ted. No, he's not here.

265
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:29,032
Good one, though--
remember that one.

266
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:36,623
Is, um, Chloe here?

267
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:38,850
She just left.
You can probably still catch her.

268
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,642
She's easy to spot--
she's got a pink umbrella.

269
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:43,300
Oh, thanks, Brian.

270
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,950
My name is Scott.

271
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,732
Your tag says Brian.

272
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,232
I know. Funny story.

273
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:49,663
So, I wake up this
morning, and...

274
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,671
Yeah, see you later, Brian.

275
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,703
There she is.

276
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,630
She doesn't look that great.

277
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:07,020
She's not fat,
but that doesn't mean anything.

278
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:09,531
I know tons of skinny,
ugly women.

279
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:12,181
That's right,
snotty girl in my yoga class,

280
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,443
I'm talking to you.

281
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:18,051
Come on, Chloe, turn around.

282
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,841
Here we go. Turn around, Chloe.

283
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:24,581
Come on,
show me that hideous face.

284
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,471
Damn it!

285
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:28,941
Ooh, I know,
I'll get ahead of her,

286
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:31,373
then I'll cut back so I... Aah!

287
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:34,083
Oh, my God, that hurts!

288
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,233
Turn around! Come on!

289
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,141
Just turn around!

290
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:41,531
Okay, this is ridiculous.

291
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:43,281
Hey!

292
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,520
Turn around!
What's the matter with you?

293
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,613
Hey, you!

294
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,961
Turn around!

295
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,163
Turn around, Chloe!

296
00:13:03,978 --> 00:13:06,511
She's hot? I'm so sorry.

297
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,902
No, it's fine.

298
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,712
I-It just makes things easier.

299
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,392
Now that I know she's a threat,

300
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,462
all I have to do is keep Marshall
from ever seeing her again.

301
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,761
Okay, I have two plans--
you can help me choose.

302
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:17,931
Plan A--

303
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:20,752
remember that time Marshall
and I had sex in the bathroom?

304
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,731
Oops, I got knocked up.

305
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:24,872
- Lily.
- Okay, plan B

306
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:27,191
is called "Chloe's Accident."

307
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,683
- Just stop.
- What?

308
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:31,000
Lily, you can't do
any of those things.

309
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,771
If you two are ever
gonna get back together,

310
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:35,631
you have to let him work
out whatever this is.

311
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,003
I know. You're right.

312
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,201
Now, come on,
Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00.

313
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,231
Some surprise for Barney.

314
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,233
- Barney?
- Uh, Swarley.

315
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,862
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

316
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:49,231
Where's Marshall?

317
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,623
Oh, he's getting a haircut.

318
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:52,833
Oh. For his date.

319
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,390
Good for him.

320
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:56,270
Hope he has a good
time tonight.

321
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:58,150
Relax, you've got
nothing to worry about.

322
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:59,603
The girl's crazy.

323
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,153
Thanks!

324
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,591
He'll just have wild monkey
sex with her five times, max,

325
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,013
and be done with her.

326
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,603
Thanks again.

327
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,810
What are you doing?

328
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:13,020
I just wanted to listen to
a little music, that's all.

329
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,591
And this next one's
going out to Swarley.

330
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,493
All your friends know
you miss Barney,

331
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:20,052
but he's gone,
and you got to accept that, baby.

332
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,943
And, Swarley, you're gonna be 
a better woman for it.

333
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:26,031
Here's "I Am Woman"
by Helen Reddy.

334
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:29,831
Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman.
I love it!

335
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:32,633
You know, I was thinking about this
whole new name thing last night,

336
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:34,851
and you know what I realized?
I like it.

337
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:36,572
You like being called Swarley?

338
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,420
Are you kidding?
I want you to call me that.

339
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:39,710
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

340
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,143
Do I think what's gonna work?
I'm just saying, I love my new name,

341
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:45,483
so please only call
me that from now on.

342
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,771
Call you what?

343
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:52,161
You know, that-that-that new name
that you've been calling me.

344
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,530
Say it.

345
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,391
Why? You guys know what it is.

346
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,080
Say the name.

347
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,611
No, I don't want to! I hate it!

348
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:03,091
I hate it! It's not funny!

349
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:05,541
It's never been funny!
I've never done any...

350
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,081
No!

351
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:09,832
Man, he is really gonna lose it

352
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:12,812
when all the magazine
subscriptions start coming in.

353
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,420
I signed him up for
People in Espanol,

354
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:18,220
but I addressed it to Swarlos.

355
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:21,860
Hey, where's the picture of
Marshall and me at the pier?

356
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,970
Didn't it used to
be by that window?

357
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:27,481
Oh, yeah, he, uh,
he sort of took it down when you left.

358
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,232
Put it behind some books,
I think.

359
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,562
Oh, well-well,
maybe I should put it back up.

360
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:33,621
Why, so Chloe'll see
it and get scared off?

361
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:34,731
No.

362
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,341
So Marshall'll see
it and feel guilty.

363
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,290
Yeah, okay.

364
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:42,470
But she wasn't okay.

365
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,202
Later that night,
while Marshall was on his date,

366
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:47,403
Lily came back.

367
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,943
...anymore.

368
00:16:05,957 --> 00:16:07,652
Pretty impressive, huh?

369
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,683
Wow, you really did memorize all the
lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire."

370
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,852
Can I, uh,
can I get you a drink?

371
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,282
I'd love a beer.

372
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:16,991
You got it.

373
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:22,191
Lily did what any
sensible woman would do.

374
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,543
She hid under the desk.

375
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:27,340
And she stayed there,
listening to her ex-fiance

376
00:16:27,356 --> 00:16:29,561
on a date with another woman.

377
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:32,193
I had a really
nice time tonight.

378
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,242
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

379
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:36,942
I like your eyes a lot, too.

380
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:39,623
Finally, much like Billy Joel,

381
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,332
she couldn't take it anymore.

382
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:43,152
Stop!

383
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:48,090
Hi. I'm Lily.

384
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,761
Lily... Lily,
what the hell are you doing?

385
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:56,091
I don't know. I...
I don't know... what I'm doing.

386
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:59,451
Oh, pumpkin beer--
that was a good one.

387
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,863
I'm just... I'm gonna go.
I... I'm so sorry.

388
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:05,901
En-Enjoy the rest of your date.

389
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,881
She seems nice.

390
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,390
- Lilly, what the hell...
- I'm sorry.

391
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:29,541
I only snuck up
there because...

392
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:32,280
when I saw how cute she was yesterday,
I freaked out.

393
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,643
Lily,  you saw her yesterday?

394
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:38,872
Yeah, I...
kind of chased her down the street.

395
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:45,232
Wait, so you were the
hunchback with the limp?

396
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:46,770
Yeah.

397
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:50,183
And she didn't break the picture,
I did.

398
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:55,623
So Chloe's not crazy, she's...

399
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:59,293
just a nice, normal girl.

400
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,171
Yeah, she is.

401
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:06,383
And you deserve a nice,
normal girl.

402
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:09,572
So, why don't you
just go back up there

403
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,232
and-and finish your date.

404
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,792
Yeah.

405
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,250
Okay.

406
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,160
Okay.

407
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:25,063
Wait, if you were the hunchback,
then why did she think you were a guy?

408
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:30,792
I-I might have used a voice
that sounded like this.

409
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:32,872
- Why?
- Because I didn't want

410
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:36,072
her to know it was me, which 
I now realize doesn't make sense,

411
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,642
because she hadn't even met me.

412
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,973
You're crazy.

413
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:48,873
You have... crazier eyes than
anybody that I have ever met.

414
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:51,920
Shouldn't you be
going back up...

415
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:53,963
I mean,
you're out of your mind.

416
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:58,201
You're... just
absolutely insane.

417
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:04,532
Shouldn't you be
going back upstairs?

418
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,651
I've missed you so much.

419
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,790
Okay, I ran it by the group,

420
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,221
and we decided we're
gonna give you a choice.

421
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:23,771
We will agree to stop
calling you Swarley,

422
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:27,292
but instead,
we'll call you Jennifer.

423
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,402
Well?

424
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,220
I'm thinking.

425
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,632
How about this?
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays...

426
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:38,363
Hey.

427
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,993
Look at this.

428
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,932
So right there,
in the exact same place

429
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,111
that six months earlier I had
walked up and found Marshall alone,

430
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,863
crying over his breakup with Lily,
I found him again.

431
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,191
Only this time he wasn't alone,

432
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,032
and he was happy.

433
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:56,283
So we went to the bar to celebrate,
and it was great.

434
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,160
I was with Robin,
Marshall and Lily were back together,

435
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:01,101
and Barney had a cool new name.

436
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,470
All was right with the world...

437
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,610
until we got back
to the apartment.

438
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:07,753
Oh, my God.

439
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:09,773
Hey, Chloe, I...

440
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,711
guess I forgot I
left you up here.

441
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:15,412
I was gonna leave,
but I can't find my keys.

442
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,391
They're right there
on the coffee table.

443
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,810
Silly me.

444
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:25,801
I must have looked
everywhere else.

445
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:31,821
Well... I'm just gonna go.

446
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,871
Oh, I don't think we've met.
I'm Chloe.

447
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:35,882
Robin.

448
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:38,221
It's nice to meet you, Roland.

449
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,441
I'll see you guys later.

450
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,093
Roland?

451
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:48,103
Your name's Roland.

452
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,102
That's funny, right?

453
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,383
Rock and Roland.

454
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:57,113
Warsaw is the capital
of what? Roland.

455
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,401
You're Monica Roland-ski.

456
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:06,123
Hey, yeah,
that's just how I Roland.

457
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:08,393
- Nice try, Swarley.
- Damn it.

458
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:19,740
Swarley!

459
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:22,061
# Sometimes you want to go #

460
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:26,821
# Where everybody #
# knows your name #

461
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:30,010
# And they're always #
# glad you came... #
