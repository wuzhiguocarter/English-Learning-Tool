1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,358
Kids, the key to a good
relationship is communication.

2
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:05,720
- You need to talk.
- How about Mimi's?

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,260
Nah, I don't really
feel like Mimi's.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,389
Well, I'm hungry.
Let's just pick a place and go.

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:11,746
Oh, you know where we
should go? Cynthia's.

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,477
You love that place--
remember what a great time we had

7
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:14,501
the last time we were there?

8
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,043
- We did?
- Yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:18,798
We had that crazy waiter who kept going,
"You two should get married!

10
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:20,400
You two should get married!"

11
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,989
It's also important to
know when to stop talking.

12
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:26,115
Come on. Then we stepped outside.
It was raining.

13
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,999
It was so romantic?

14
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,870
How can you not remember this?

15
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,031
Because it wasn't me.

16
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:35,203
Oh, right!

17
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,793
It was...

18
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,662
my sister.

19
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,583
You see,
by the time you've hit your late 20s,

20
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,010
you've dated a few people,

21
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,591
but when you're in a relationship,
it's common courtesy to pretend

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,560
that you haven't.

23
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:49,220
Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on.

24
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,920
Remember when we
went to see it?

25
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:52,701
We sat in the back row.

26
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:55,151
I've never seen Van Helsing.

27
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:57,392
That's right.
I saw it with my sister.

28
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,660
My boss just got
back from Maui.

29
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:02,112
He said it was really romantic.

30
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,733
Oh, it's so romantic.

31
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:05,520
When were you in Maui?

32
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:09,871
- I... went... with my sister.
- With my sister.

33
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,613
Why do you always say that?

34
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:15,532
Look, we're not 16.
We've both dated other people.

35
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,682
It's silly to try to
act like we didn't.

36
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:18,813
You're right.

37
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:20,223
We should just be honest.

38
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:21,350
Totally.

39
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:23,183
See that girl over there?

40
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:26,733
Three years ago,
I totally made out with her.

41
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:28,703
I don't want to hear that.

42
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:31,240
- What? You said...
- God, that is so insensitive.

43
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,112
- Remember honesty...?
- You're a jerk!

44
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,371
Well, you're...

45
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:37,182
confusing.

48
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,280
Okay, so you have to
have sex with one.

49
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:58,093
Either classic mermaid;
bottom half fish, top half human,

50
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:02,160
or inverted mermaid,
top half fish, bottom half human.

51
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:03,240
Go!

52
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:05,273
I don't know. Is she fat?

53
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:08,051
Yeah, but it's a fish,
so it's the good kind of fat.

54
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,310
Hot off the presses!

55
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:11,871
I-I don't take flyers.

56
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,810
You took one two seconds
before you walked in here.

57
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,653
That's different.
It was for a strip club.

58
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:16,622
Two bucks off wings.

59
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,300
How much is your flyer
going to save me on wings?

60
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,640
Fine. It's a flyer
from my play.

61
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:23,410
Oh, Lily, I'd love to,
but we're not in college

62
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:24,972
and I'm not trying
to sleep with you.

63
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,672
- So anyway, this mermaid...
- Hey, Lily's friend asked her

64
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,201
to be in this play,
and it's gonna be really good.

65
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:33,751
Lily, I love you,
but we're too old for this.

66
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,611
Asking someone to
come see your play

67
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,223
is like asking someone
for a ride to the airport

68
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,013
or to crash on your couch
or to help you move.

69
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,661
Call a cab, book a room,

70
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:44,751
hire some movers
and repeat after me:

71
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:48,123
Friends  don't let friends
come see their crappy play.

72
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:52,841
Okay, first of all,
I've thought about it and top half fish.

73
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:55,831
Second of all, we need you guys
to decide something for us.

74
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:57,231
Yes, you should break up.

75
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:01,030
So, earlier tonight...

76
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:05,151
Mm, we should get
down to the bar.

77
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,952
I know we should,

78
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:10,562
but you just look so sexy
in my red sweatshirt.

79
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:15,881
Oh, God,
why is this part of the story?

80
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,151
We're getting to it.

81
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:20,611
Damn, my face is so dry.
Is there any moisturizer around here?

82
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:22,192
Yeah, there's some
in the bathroom.

83
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:23,822
Got to moisturize!

84
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,091
Got to keep that
pretty face moist.

85
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:29,090
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

86
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,770
- What's wrong with her?
- She hates that word.

87
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:35,070
- What word, "moist"?
- No! Seriously, stop!

88
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:38,811
So, anyway, Ted goes into the
bathroom to get the moist...

89
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:40,400
face lotion...

90
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,220
Wow, this is great stuff.

91
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,633
Now I know the secret to
your great complexion.

92
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,223
What are you talking about?
It's yours.

93
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:47,431
No, it's not.

94
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,882
Oh, well...
then I guess it's Lily's.

95
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:51,220
No, it's not.

96
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:54,091
Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?

97
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:55,551
Um, my sister's.

98
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,953
So, in other words,
some girl you went out with.

99
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:01,891
Um... I love you.

100
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:06,340
Disgusting. You let me put on the
same moisturizer as one of your exes?

101
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,303
It was probably Carla's.
Her face was a train wreck.

102
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:12,011
I'm don't think Ted was
dating her for her face.

103
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:14,223
Thank you, Marshall.

104
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,731
Thank you so much.

105
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,480
Why is that still
in your apartment?

106
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,292
I don't know.
I just never threw it out.

107
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,912
Well, why not? Do you still
have feelings for this girl?

108
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,302
Yeah. I'm madly
in love with her,

109
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:26,863
and the only way
I can deal with it

110
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,111
is by holding onto a
three-dollar tube of lotion.

111
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,320
Not three dollars! Try 14.

112
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,843
Why is this such a big deal?

113
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,893
Because I don't want to use
some whore's moisturizer!

114
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:39,882
Whoa, she wasn't a whore.

115
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:43,041
Well, she's leaving expensive
lotions all over town.

116
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,682
It sounds like a whore to me.

117
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,443
What else do you have from old
girlfriends just lying around?

118
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:49,042
Nothing. That's it.

119
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,541
Well, except for
the phone booth.

120
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,111
And the lamp by the desk...

121
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:56,231
and the...

122
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,301
No.

123
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,030
No! No! Oh, Ted!

124
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,310
Ah, the age-old question:

125
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,901
after  you break up with someone,
what do you do with the stuff?

126
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,260
Question? Ain't no
question, girl.

127
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:12,982
Obviously, he's got
to get rid of it.

128
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:16,132
Which is obviously crazy and obviously,
I'm not gonna do it.

129
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,073
So we agreed that we 
would let you guys decide.

130
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:21,150
Yeah, like we did with
Marshall's pants.

131
00:05:21,306 --> 00:05:26,580
Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v.
The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.

132
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,333
Nice, right?

133
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,823
I'm gonna have to say no.

134
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,810
I don't want some 16-year-old
girl falling in love with you

135
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:38,612
and then shooting
Lily in the face.

136
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:39,642
Yes!

137
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,242
I vote they can stay.

138
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,632
"Check out the jackass in the
parachute pants" is a good icebreaker.

139
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:47,381
T ed.

140
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,202
Ted? Ted?

141
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:52,372
Sorry, buddy,
it's a "no" for me, too.

142
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:54,980
Oh, and by the way,
Bel Biv Devoe called.

143
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,160
Even they don't want
those pants back.

144
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:59,509
They were insanely comfortable!

145
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,915
They were like pajamas
you could wear outside.

146
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,639
Marshall, it's over.

147
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:07,462
We even gave you an appeal and they
didn't look any better with combat boots.

148
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,351
All right, well, let's hear the
arguments. Ted, you go first.

149
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:15,272
Okay. The fact that I still have things
from ex-girlfriends is no big deal.

150
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:17,341
I mean,
when I see the phone booth on the piano,

151
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:19,041
I don't think of
Jeannie Radford,

152
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,611
I think of the good times I
had backpacking through Europe.

153
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,772
And when I see the lamp,
I don't think of Allison Moses.

154
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,013
I remember when I was broke,
just out of college,

155
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:28,792
and I really needed a lamp.

156
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:32,022
And when I see that throw pillow,
I don't think of Lauren Stein.

157
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,030
I think of that weird orange-brown
stain and how it got there.

158
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,890
Creamsicle and turkey gravy,

159
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:38,390
not at the same time.

160
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:40,512
Well, that's adorable,

161
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:44,290
but from now on, when I walk into the
apartment, here is what I will see.

162
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:49,912
I'm Ted's college girlfriend.
He made me 12 mix tapes.

163
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:51,841
How many has he made you?

164
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:55,830
He calls you "sweetie pie"?

165
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:57,970
He called me "sweetie pie."

166
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,870
I'm stupid,
but my rack is bigger than yours.

167
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,613
Really? You can't
look at a pillow

168
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,683
without seeing my ex-girlfriend--
a pillow!

169
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,070
Yes, Ted, the fact that you still
have that pillow is creepy and gross.

170
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,860
- You're creepy and gross.
- Your mom's creepy and gross.

171
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,683
Order! Order!

172
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,711
I got to side with Robin.

173
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:24,000
She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff
upsets her, you got to get rid of it.

174
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:25,832
I've got to side with Ted.

175
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,932
Just 'cause you still have
something an ex-girlfriend gave you

176
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:29,661
doesn't mean you're
holding onto her.

177
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,092
All right, Barney.

178
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,133
It all comes down to you.

179
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:36,430
- I side with Robin.
- What?

180
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,203
Ted, your place
is too cluttered.

181
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:40,481
It's like you're living
in a Bennigan's.

182
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,530
Or a Danby's.

183
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,342
What, they don't have
Danby's in the US?

184
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:48,221
Really?

185
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:51,442
Well, then were do you get
Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?

186
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,072
Just stop, sweetie.

187
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:56,942
So I had no choice.

188
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,652
I packed up everything I had
gotten from ex-girlfriends.

189
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,072
It was painful,

190
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:04,391
but not as painful as what I
had to endure later that night.

191
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,870
New York is famous
for its theater,

192
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,530
but there's many
different levels.

193
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:10,982
There's Broadway,

194
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:12,651
off-Broadway,

195
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,491
off-off-Broadway,

196
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,751
homeless people
screaming in the park,

197
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:19,913
and then below that,
the play Aunt Lily was in.

198
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,431
Eight flights, of stairs.

199
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:25,471
Who puts a theater up
eight flights of stairs?

200
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,001
What kind of building is this?

201
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:30,222
From the smell of it,
I'm guessing a urine factory.

202
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,242
Where do you guys want to sit?

203
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,633
I know where I
don't want to sit.

204
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,312
Guys, four together!

205
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:43,362
I brought a bag in case
anyone needs to puke.

206
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,901
Come on.
It's not gonna be that bad.

207
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,561
No? Okay.

208
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:06,023
I... am... Rage!

209
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,152
I... am Greed.

210
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:19,920
I am Rage... Envy!

211
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,112
I am outta here.

212
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,322
No, you're not.
You have to stay.

213
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:31,081
This is the face
of Consumerism!

214
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,642
Oh, my God.
Ted's part of the play.

215
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:44,673
Hello, Greed, Rage...

216
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:46,761
Envy...

217
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:51,830
and Consumerism.

218
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,982
I... am your father...

219
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,501
America!

220
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,982
Oh, baby, that was wonderful!

221
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:22,350
Totally, I had no idea
Greed was the killer.

222
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:24,142
And when it became a
play within a play,

223
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:26,541
I was, like,
"Now we are really cookin'!"

224
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:29,552
Wow, Lily, that sucked!

225
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:31,401
Barney!

226
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,040
What? It was terrible.

227
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:35,392
I mean, come on.
You guys agree, right?

228
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:39,060
Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest
'cause, you know, we're friends.

229
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:41,812
No, friends make each
other feel good.

230
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:44,093
They build each other
up and support them.

231
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:46,432
That's what being a
good friend is about.

232
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:48,741
Yeah, if you're a Smurf.

233
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,533
You know if you did a play,
I would sit through the whole thing

234
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,890
and I would compliment
you on it afterwards.

235
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:55,251
Oh, really? You would?

236
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:56,331
Yes.

237
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:59,790
Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.

238
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,730
We'll be starting our
Q&A with the director--

239
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,062
yours truly--

240
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,571
in five minutes right here.

241
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,610
Can you believe Barney said
that about Lily's play?

242
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,591
I know.
He can be really insensitive.

243
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:18,552
It was pretty bad, though.

244
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:20,291
Oh, my God, it was so bad.

245
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,092
Oh, my God, you've been robbed!

246
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,192
Nope.

247
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:35,733
All that stuff was
from old girlfriends?

248
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,102
Don't you buy anything
for yourself?

249
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,543
What can I say?

250
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:43,210
Papa gets swag.

251
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:47,402
And that should've been the end of it.
But the next day...

252
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:49,813
You know, at first I was really bummed
about getting rid of all my stuff.

253
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:52,401
But seeing how happy it makes you--
totally worth it.

254
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:55,071
Mm, that's kind of how I feel when
I begrudgingly have sex with you

255
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:56,250
when I'm really tired.

256
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,063
Exactly. Sometimes you
gotta take one for the team.

257
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,933
Well, sit. Sit, yeah.

258
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,303
So you never keep anything
your ex-boyfriends gave you?

259
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:06,402
Nope.

260
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,313
Well, except for my dogs.

261
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,692
So I had to get rid of everything
from my past relationships

262
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:28,243
because you don't keep things
from your past relationships

263
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:31,542
except, uh, where are your five
dogs from? Oh, that's right:

264
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,172
your past relationships.

265
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:34,500
What's your point, Ted?

266
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:37,100
Well, you know how you said 
you come over to my apartment,

267
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:39,353
and all you can see
are my ex-girlfriends?

268
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:42,911
What, so when you look at my dogs,
all you see is my ex-boyfriends?

269
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,663
I do now.

270
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,411
That's ridiculous.

271
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,010
I thought you said you got rid of
everything your ex-boyfriends gave you.

272
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,633
Well, yeah, but not my dogs.

273
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:57,471
You said everything.

274
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,081
But not living things.

275
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:02,040
Well, tell that to the rare
Bolivian cactus I threw away.

276
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:04,260
Things with a
heartbeat can stay.

277
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:08,850
Enjoying this?

278
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,921
Pickles, go get your ball.

279
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:12,563
Go get your ball.

280
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,961
Just admit it.
It was a little hypocritical of you

281
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:21,542
to make me get rid
of all my stuff.

282
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:24,840
Well, what do you want me to do, Ted?
Get rid of my dogs?

283
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:28,893
Guess what position
we did it in.

284
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:31,722
Yes. Yes,
I want you to get rid of your dogs.

285
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:33,511
Um, no.

286
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,612
Really? Well,
I say we take it to the group,

287
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:44,352
but I don't like your chances.

288
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,293
She's not getting
rid of the dogs.

289
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,113
What's the matter with you?

290
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:51,353
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- Yes!

291
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:54,791
You can ask somebody to get rid of their
iguana after it poops in your hair,

292
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:56,611
but not their dog.

293
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:58,423
I miss Jebediah.

294
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,441
Oh, I almost forgot.

295
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:03,393
Flyers for my new play.

296
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:04,892
Very funny.

297
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:06,033
Oh, it's not a joke.

298
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,390
It's my one-man show
premiering tomorrow night.

299
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:11,171
And even though it's terrible
and excruciatingly long,

300
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,861
I expect you all to be there
since we're such good friends.

301
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,040
Oh, we'll be there.

302
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:17,181
Unless, of course, you just want
to admit that you were wrong...

303
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:18,722
- Never.
- Good.

304
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:21,263
Okay, I gotta go rehearse.

305
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:24,051
Oh, I almost forgot.
Bring a poncho;

306
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:25,633
the first three rows get wet.

307
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,993
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
where the dogs came from.

308
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,722
I'm sorry I asked you
to get rid of them.

309
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,262
That was ridiculous.

310
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,222
So we're-we're okay?

311
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,493
Yeah, we're great. 

312
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:53,673
And I thought we were,

313
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:56,840
but just as it did in the
seventh act of Aunt Lily's play,

314
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:59,222
Jealousy reared its ugly head.

315
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:10,482
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

316
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,951
Dude, I gotta pee.

317
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,702
I gotta go.

318
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:39,002
Oh, he's really having trouble
dealing with this, huh?

319
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,512
Yeah, he really is.

320
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:43,723
It's got me thinking,
maybe I should get rid of my dogs.

321
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,193
Might be time to send
them to the farm.

322
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:48,902
- You're gonna kill your dogs?!
- No! No, no, no,

323
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,450
there really is a farm.

324
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:52,263
My aunt has a farm upstate.

325
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:53,731
Oh, thank God.

326
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:56,142
Aw, you know,
if I were five dogs,

327
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:59,793
I'd rather live on a farm than
in an apartment in Brooklyn.

328
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,630
Yeah. I could visit
them on weekends.

329
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,470
My aunt is awfully lonely up there.
It's just her and her lover, Betty.

330
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,453
Oh, that's perfect.
They love dogs.

331
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:11,600
"They"? What do
you mean by "they"?

332
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,202
Uh... uh.... uh...
People upstate.

333
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:15,821
Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!

334
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,140
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

335
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:21,430
I mean,
you know that this is gonna be...

336
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:24,253
I know, but I'm gonna sit
through the whole thing,

337
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,720
and I'm gonna say something
nice about it afterwards.

338
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:27,670
You know why?

339
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:29,481
Because that's what friends do.

340
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:46,472
Moist.

341
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:49,400
Moist.

342
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:51,201
Moist.

343
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:53,500
Moist.

344
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,622
That was the first 40
minutes of Barney's show.

345
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:56,692
Moist.

346
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:01,033
And then we endured
about 20 minutes of this.

347
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,593
I have to go refill.

348
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:16,470
I'll be back in a moment.

349
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:17,763
Play's not over.

350
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:23,792
I never get picked for
audience participation.

351
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:27,161
And then it just got weird.

352
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:32,960
Feelings.

353
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,200
Inside.

354
00:17:36,496 --> 00:17:38,392
Oh, no!

355
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:49,930
And when that didn't work...

356
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:10,710
Okay! Stop!

357
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:12,512
You win. Fine.

358
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:16,153
Barney, I'm sorry I made
you come to my show.

359
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:17,282
Thank you, Lily.

360
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:19,462
Is there anything you'd
like to say about my show?

361
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,413
No.

362
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:23,800
No, I have nothing nice
to say about your show.

363
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,270
You were right, Barney.

364
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:26,643
Let's go to the bar.

365
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,060
Yes! I win!

366
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,792
I love winning!

367
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:34,231
Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily.

368
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:36,342
I was just getting
warmed up, man!

369
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:00,000
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:39,483
If you had any idea what was
coming up in act two... oh!

370
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,600
Well, I imagine it was pretty awful,
so let's go.

371
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:45,962
Pretty awful? Pretty awful?!
It was a masterpiece of awful.

372
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:49,482
It's genius how bad it is.
I kind of wish you guys could see it.

373
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:51,180
Yeah, well, anyway.

374
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,610
Act two is where I
really hit my stride.

375
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:57,393
Spoiler alert:
the robot falls in love.

376
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:02,401
How about this, Barney?
How about we stay

377
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:05,461
and-and watch the
rest of your show?

378
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,251
It's your funeral.

379
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,573
Five, six, one, two.

380
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,793
So we stayed and let Barney torture
us for another hour and a half,

381
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,781
'cause that's what
friends do, apparently.

382
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:25,872
Hey.

383
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:27,992
Where've you been?
I called you earlier.

384
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:30,633
I gave my dogs away to my aunt.

385
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,802
You what?

386
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:35,660
Yeah. Just for a few months
as a test run, but...

387
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:38,031
I think it's for the best.

388
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:39,800
Wow.

389
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,733
Oh, man.

390
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,402
Can we go inside?

391
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,813
Uh, no.
Uh, let's go to the bar.

392
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,473
Why? What's going on inside?

393
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,801
- Um, the floors are gone.
- What?

394
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:55,351
Yeah. I-I sent them out to get,
um, fixed.

395
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:57,373
This is a terrible lie.
I'm just going to bail.

396
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:12,072
I didn't know you were
getting rid of the dogs!

397
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,020
You said you threw
all that stuff away!

398
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:17,113
Kids, this was the worst
fight Robin and I ever had.

399
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:19,560
It was one of those fights
that last for hours

400
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:22,741
and you start to get woozy and lose
track of what you're fighting about.

401
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:26,562
We fought for so long,
seasons changed outside the window.

402
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,431
Pages of the calendar blew off.
It was crazy.

403
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:33,051
But, ultimately, and I couldn't
tell you how for the life of me,

404
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:35,673
but somehow we got to here.

405
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:41,240
We're really doing this?

406
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:43,822
Yeah.

407
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,853
- We're moving in together!
- We're moving in together!

408
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,742
The robot found love

409
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,631
Confusing my circuitry

410
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,793
My software's been hacked

411
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,451
Toaster oven

412
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:08,672
You're the one for me

413
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:11,933
Two, three, four.

414
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:21,820
That's two.

415
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:27,313
