1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:03,369
Some kids dream of
being astronauts.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,558
Some kids dream of
playing baseball.

3
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:08,099
When I was a kid,
I had only one dream.

4
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:09,688
To build a skyscraper.

5
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:11,664
That's stupid.

6
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:15,206
There were some
obstacles along the way.

7
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,605
But eventually my
dream came true.

8
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,226
I became an architect.

9
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:21,604
Morning, everyone!

10
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:26,480
So, I had an idea
for the atrium.

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,908
Ready?

12
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,962
Columns.

13
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:32,332
That's stupid.

16
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:56,082
I... I can't believe you
knocked over my model.

17
00:00:56,098 --> 00:01:00,141
Well, it's just...
it's not exactly new, is it-- columns?

18
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:03,383
I mean, what's your next
groundbreaking idea-- ceilings?

19
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:04,960
Floors?

20
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:06,763
Windows?

21
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:09,532
I know what you're thinking:
Who's this jerk?

22
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:12,083
Well, this jerk was
Hammond Druthers,

23
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:14,411
a legend in the
architecture community.

24
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,270
Very big in the '80s.

25
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:20,011
He was also far and away
the worst boss I ever had.

26
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:23,542
Then I designed the Spokane
National Bank Building.

27
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:26,013
And suddenly... I was his boss.

28
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:28,510
- And he didn't like it.
- Stairs?

29
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:31,813
And to be honest,
I wasn't sure I liked it either.

30
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:34,800
See, before,
when I was just another employee,

31
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:37,342
I was happy, carefree.

32
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:40,180
The guy who hung out in the break
room making fun of the boss.

33
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:41,250
Did you see what he
was wearing today?

34
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:44,040
It was like his pants were
being held up by his nipples.

35
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,681
Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers,
I get hay fever just looking at it.

36
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:54,233
But suddenly I was
a different guy.

37
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:56,842
Hey, guys.

38
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:58,783
What's so funny?

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:01:59,981
Nothing.

40
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,963
Um... nice shirt.

41
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:04,672
Thanks.

42
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:06,381
The hours were insane.

43
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,563
I was always working even
when I wasn't at work.

44
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:12,963
Oh, Robin...
I just had a great idea.

45
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:16,702
Oh, do whatever you want to
me just don't wake me up.

46
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,343
Before, I used to be this guy.

47
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:25,663
Dude, of course you should take the
day off for the Foo Fighters concert.

48
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,913
Just say you're sick.

49
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:28,040
But now...

50
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,390
I was this guy.

51
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:30,780
Sick, huh?

52
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,102
Unbutton your shirt.

53
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,642
Hmm... "Foo Fighters."

54
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:41,600
Get back to work.

55
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:45,003
But still,
the worst part was Druthers.

56
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,222
- Well, I was thinking...
- Ceilings? Oops.

57
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:51,973
Said that already. Then again,
you seem to like rehashing old ideas.

58
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:54,673
I'm kidding, of course.

59
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:56,631
Another hole in one, boss.

60
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:00,201
Oh, wow,
he must be really good-looking.

61
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,291
Why would you say that?

62
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,261
Well, 'cause only good-looking people
can get away with saying things like that.

63
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,711
I have found that to be true.

64
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,682
It's a blessing
and a curse really.

65
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,571
Ted, you can't let him
treat you like that.

66
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,833
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,
who's the boss?

67
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:14,852
- Tony.
- Angela.   - Mona.

68
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:16,111
Mona?

69
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,631
Watch it more closely.
Rock your world.

70
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,661
So, what are you gonna do?

71
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:23,983
Well... it's awkward, I mean,
the guy used to be my boss.

72
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,142
So,  I went to talk to
the managing partner.

73
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:27,503
Fire him.

74
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:30,972
Well, sir, I was thinking he could
just be put on a different project.

75
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:32,281
Fire him!

76
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:35,960
He's an arrogant,
washed-up, pain in the ass.

77
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:38,791
In fact,
fire everyone on that project.

78
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:42,040
Druthers, Mosby,
the whole lot of them.

79
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:45,443
Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear
Mosby's doing some great work.

80
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:50,181
Fine, Mosby can stay.
But tell him he's on thin ice.

81
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,553
Come here.

82
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:58,073
I like you, Crosby.

83
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,050
You mind if I charge my phone?

84
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,371
Knock yourself out.

85
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,973
Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers,
the key is timing.

86
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:08,392
Remember when I had to
fire my makeup artist?

87
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:12,320
Vicki, um...
I'm so sorry about this,

88
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,522
but there's been some
budget cuts and, um,

89
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:17,361
we have to let you go.

90
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:19,581
I mean, after tonight.

91
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:22,221
I still need my makeup
for the broadcast.

92
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,190
So...

93
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:29,871
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of the victims.

94
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,242
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

95
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm gonna fire
Druthers tomorrow.

96
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,980
- Oh, my God!
- What?

97
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,240
- Do you know about this?
- No.

98
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,332
What is that?

99
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,923
Only the greatest thing ever.

100
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:47,633
Wait, wait, wait--
that's not enough buildup.

101
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,521
If they were to cure
cancer tomorrow,

102
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:53,193
this would still be the greatest
thing to happen all week.

103
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:57,520
Okay. Now you're ready
for naked Marshall.

104
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,811
Oh, my God.

105
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,442
This is awesome times awesome.

106
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:04,021
It's awesome squared.

107
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,550
I know, right?
Behind the piano this whole time.

108
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:08,930
Wait. If Marshall went to
all this trouble to hide it,

109
00:05:08,947 --> 00:05:11,011
he clearly doesn't
want us to find it.

110
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,560
Oh, come on, Robin.

111
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:16,412
No, I'm saying that he must be
really embarrassed by this.

112
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,170
We are gonna have so much fun.

113
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,090
I know!
We're gonna have so much fun!

114
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:23,513
Oh, sorry I'm late;
lunch ran a little long.

115
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:24,941
You wanted to see me, Mosby?

116
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,370
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.

117
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:30,941
Well, excuse me,
for spending the last four hours

118
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,543
drawing designs
for your building.

119
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,163
This is a cocktail napkin.

120
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,600
Covered in profanity.

121
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,863
Look, Hammond, um,

122
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,641
there's no easy way
to say this, so...

123
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,402
why don't we just, um,
step into your office.

124
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:53,800
# Happy birthday to you #

125
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:57,682
- # Happy birthday to you #
- Oh, you had me. You so had me.

126
00:05:57,697 --> 00:06:01,870
# Happy birthday, dear Hammond #

127
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:05,192
# Happy birthday to you #

128
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,521
So, you didn't fire him? 

129
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:10,670
I can't fire a guy on his birthday.
Everyone would hate me.

130
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:14,353
Besides, they put a party hat on me.
My authority was compromised.

131
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:18,383
Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat.

132
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:21,820
I know how much
you love stools.

133
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:25,143
Thanks. Yeah,
stools are better for your posture.

134
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:29,782
And, uh... I... got you a rose.

135
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,890
Thank you. That's so sweet.

136
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:34,831
You guys are being... so sweet.

137
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:38,173
Hey, guys. Guess what I got.
A new dart.

138
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:39,910
Oh,  wow, a new dart.

139
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:41,692
Hey, that new dart is great.

140
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:44,012
I did not know you were such
a fan of new dart, Barney.

141
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:46,733
Oh, yes, Robin,
I just love new dart.

142
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:48,560
Nude art.

143
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,530
- Nude art.
- Nude art.

144
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,798
Okay, all right, so what,
you guys found the painting, huh?

145
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,212
I knew this day would come.

146
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:57,452
How did you know that?

147
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:59,451
Because I didn't
hide it very well.

148
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,321
So  the story on the painting is that,
back in college,

149
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,243
Lily wanted to do a nude
study for her art class.

150
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:07,123
Marshall wasn't
so into the idea.

151
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:09,172
Well, I just...
don't think that some dude

152
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:11,851
should drop trou just
to pose for you.

153
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:16,273
It's for class, and it's just that
weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.

154
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,062
The frisbee dude
with the soul patch?

155
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,752
He's like the hottest
guy in school!

156
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,103
No, he's actually
a little husky...

157
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,742
Oh, he's just huggable!

158
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,351
And complicated...

159
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,221
and a little bit of a jerk.

160
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:28,902
Just enough so you think
maybe you can change him.

161
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,031
Okay, just forget it.

162
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,100
Call me old-fashioned,

163
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:38,890
I just think that I'm the only
guy you should see naked.

164
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:41,542
Well, then you'll
have to do it.

165
00:07:41,558 --> 00:07:44,802
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody sees it?

166
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:47,161
We're not in high
school anymore.

167
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,842
People don't make fun of you
for posing nude for a painting.

168
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,612
We're adults now.

169
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:54,631
We totally saw your butt.

170
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,801
This painting has caused
too much grief already.

171
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,512
I'm destroying it right now.

172
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,602
Oh, no,
what's the matter, Marshall?

173
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:06,731
Where is it?

174
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:10,193
I'll tell you where it is if
you'll answer these riddles three.

175
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:11,972
You hung it up in the bar,
didn't you?

176
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,701
Yo, why you gotta
ruin my riddles?

177
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:16,801
Field trip!

178
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:24,621
Oh, no. Someone put your
painting up behind the bar.

179
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:25,801
Classic!

180
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,763
What a memorable prank.

181
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:31,372
Hey, Marshall.
What'll you have?

182
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,361
What'll I have?
Um, I don't know, maybe a beer

183
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:37,411
and that nude painting of
me hanging behind the bar!

184
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,311
Ooh, I'm sorry,
that painting's property of the bar.

185
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:40,770
I know that Barney gave
you that painting.

186
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:42,111
I don't know what
you're talking about.

187
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:43,573
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

188
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:44,570
I doubt it.

189
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:46,421
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll give you that plus ten bucks.

190
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,343
I doubt it.

191
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:49,973
All right, you know what, Carl, you
just lost yourself a regular customer.

192
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:51,531
I doubt it.

193
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,962
This painting is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

194
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:03,320
Okay, where should we put it up next?
In his law school?

195
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,990
Ooh on the side of a bus.
Oh, oh!

196
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,541
How much do billboards cost?

197
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:09,070
Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse.

198
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:11,431
I've got a five-year
rollout plan.

199
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:14,042
I'll have you know that painting's
got commitments all over the city.

200
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,682
Then, after New York...

201
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,222
One of my worst
fears has come true--

202
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:27,460
I just saw Marshall
grabbing himself naked.

203
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:29,840
Well, I gotta go.

204
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,830
Believe it or not,
I have to go back to the office.

205
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:33,293
Oh, I'll go out with you.

206
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,402
Bye, guys.

207
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:38,871
You know, I wish everyone didn't
have to make fun of that painting.

208
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:41,431
Eh, we're not making fun of the painting,
we're just making fun of Marshall.

209
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,570
The painting's
actually really great.

210
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,781
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

211
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:47,740
Well, thank you.

212
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:51,152
You know, seeing it again
makes me miss painting nudes.

213
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:55,152
What?

214
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,051
Paint me.

215
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:58,941
What?

216
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:01,852
Paint me.

217
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:08,961
Who's that?

218
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,580
Who's out there?

219
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:12,562
Hammond, is that you?

220
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:13,901
Mosby?

221
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,383
Druthers and I were
alone in the office.

222
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:18,740
If I was gonna fire him,

223
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:20,741
this would be the best
chance I'd ever have.

224
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,651
Uh, look, just a second, Ted.

225
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,760
Uh, no, I,
I really need to talk to you.

226
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:26,852
Look, there's no
easy way to say...

227
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:28,321
What, what are you doing?

228
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,663
What are you doing?

229
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:33,501
I'm standing here
wearing pants.

230
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,762
Are you sleeping here?
What's going on?

231
00:10:36,777 --> 00:10:38,432
Okay, fine, yes.

232
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:39,770
Not that it's any
of your business

233
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,611
but my wife had a little
spat a few weeks ago,

234
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:45,560
and I've been sleeping
here until she cools off.

235
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:48,411
Okay, well, uh, you're right--
that is none of my business.

236
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:50,651
Uh, look,
there's no easy way to say this-- I...

237
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,040
Who am I kidding?

238
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:55,200
She's never gonna take me back.

239
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,313
It's okay.

240
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,121
What did you want to say to me?

241
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:14,421
Happy birthday, buddy.

242
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:27,112
So, you've been
living at the office?

243
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:28,542
Yes. 

244
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:31,673
I'm an architect
without a home.

245
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:34,293
You see the tragic
irony in that?

246
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,991
- Yeah, I do.
- 'Cause I design homes.

247
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,242
- I see it.
- But I don't have a home.

248
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:38,630
Not lost on me at all.

249
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:42,281
But I don't understand--
why don't you just go to a hotel?

250
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,772
You could be sleeping on
a mattress instead of...

251
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,012
what appears to be torn-up
drawings of my building.

252
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:50,110
Why  would I go to a hotel,
when any second,

253
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,562
she's going to call and
tell me to come home.

254
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,812
She's a very special lady, Ted.

255
00:11:56,906 --> 00:12:01,150
She's quite... mannish.

256
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,652
She gives me what I need.

257
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:05,431
Do you understand that?

258
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,223
Uh,  no, I don't.

259
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,870
If you were lost
in the wilderness,

260
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,250
she can provide for me.

261
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:16,330
Well, that's the dream.

262
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:20,283
I'm glad you came
here tonight, Ted.

263
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:21,270
Me too, Hammond.

264
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,331
- Call me Ham.
- No, thanks.

265
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,851
- Hammy D?
- No, I think just Hammond.

266
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:28,451
So, I'm guessing
you didn't fire him.

267
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:33,071
I was this close.

268
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:36,120
Meanwhile, Lily had
been up all night

269
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,141
in the grips of a dilemma.

270
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,723
- Oh honey, you're awake?
- I'm awake.

271
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,681
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:56,612
I've kind of been
wrestling with something.

273
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,801
What if I told you I had a
way to pay for our honeymoon?

274
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,653
Baby, our honeymoon's
already paid for.

275
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,501
We're going to Howe Caverns.

276
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:08,771
Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't
want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?

277
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:12,471
It's not just a cave,
it's a whole labyrinth of caves.

278
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,392
It's an underground adventure.

279
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:17,522
There's a cave that's so dark that
you don't even know you're in there.

280
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:20,553
I mean, we're going to experience
a whole new kind of dark.

281
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,640
Well, what if I found a way
to make a little extra money

282
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:27,781
so that we spend our
honeymoon not in Howe Caverns,

283
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:30,221
but in Scotland?

284
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,292
- Loch Ness?
- Yeah.

285
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:35,332
And you know, Edinburgh and
the Highlands and Glasgow...

286
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:38,230
Loch Ness. Nessy.

287
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:42,772
Baby, I would love to search for the
enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch,

288
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:45,721
but... we can't afford that.

289
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:47,670
Maybe we can.

290
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:50,891
Paint me.

291
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,090
Okay, I don't get this.

292
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:55,142
You've been making fun of
that painting all this time

293
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:56,782
and now you want
me to paint you?

294
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:59,450
We knew we could torture
Marshall because he has shame.

295
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,622
I do not.

296
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:03,391
In my body,
where the shame gland should be,

297
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:05,812
there's a second awesome gland.

298
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,172
True story.

299
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:10,161
Yeah, that's not the gland
I'm worried about painting.

300
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:11,791
Yeah.

301
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:14,550
A nude Barney is a challenge.

302
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:18,863
But I think you're talented
enough to immortalize this.

303
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,711
Now is the time-- I'm 31.

304
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,601
I'm at the peak of
my physical beauty.

305
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:28,863
If I were a woman,
I'd have passed it long, long ago.

306
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,121
Long ago.

307
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:32,492
Forget it.

308
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:35,990
I promised Marshall he was the
only guy I would ever see naked.

309
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,870
I'll give you $5,000.

310
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,410
We're going to Loch Ness!

311
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:43,581
Yeah!

312
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,330
That cabby would not shut up.

313
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,310
Yeah, we should
call him a gabby.

314
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,653
I think it, you say it.

315
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:57,002
Hey, uh... thanks for putting
me up last night, buddy.

316
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:58,672
Give 'em hell.

317
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,303
Morning, team.

318
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:05,030
So, I have given
it some thought,

319
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:09,143
and I say we revisit columns.

320
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:11,792
Oh, God, not this again.

321
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:15,510
Ted, a man in a toga just arrived
and delivered a parchment.

322
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:16,951
Let me read it:

323
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,252
Oh! It's from ancient Greece.

324
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,590
They want their basic
architectural elements back.

325
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:24,632
- Geez.
- What?

326
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,971
You didn't hear me?

327
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:27,833
Toga, parchment...

328
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,901
Can I see you for one second?

329
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,591
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.

330
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,031
What are you doing?

331
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:38,592
I thought we were friends.

332
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,681
You slept on my couch,
you ate my cereal.

333
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,073
I tossed you more toilet paper.

334
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:44,353
We are friends. 

335
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:48,413
But that doesn't magically
make your bad ideas good.

336
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,212
What? I don't believe this!

337
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,322
You're, you're,
you're wearing my clothes!

338
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:54,371
And my
girlfriend's... sneakers--

339
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,580
man, you have
weirdly small feet.

340
00:15:56,636 --> 00:16:00,420
Ted, I hope that you're not going
to let our professional woes

341
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:02,401
interfere with our friendship,

342
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:05,721
because  I really kind
of need you right now.

343
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:10,153
Okay, let's get this over with.

344
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:13,100
Hey, hey!
I don't want you phoning this in.

345
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:16,131
This painting could, someday,
become a serious work of art.

346
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:18,790
I mean, you have been
blessed with an amazing gift.

347
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:20,203
Thank you.

348
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:21,782
I meant me.

349
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,671
Now, I like how you captured
Marshall's essence.

350
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:28,013
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.

351
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,712
But me,
I want something more regal.

352
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,890
Something my progeny
could look at and say,

353
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:35,651
"There's stands
Barnabus Stinson."

354
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,371
He was wise...

355
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,561
and strong.

356
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:43,943
I don't think your
sword will fit.

357
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:45,640
I get that a lot.

358
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,953
And so, as Lily began painting,

359
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,883
Marshall thought
about the $5,000

360
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,382
and what his fiancée
was doing to earn it.

361
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,092
This isn't right.

362
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:58,040
This isn't right at all.

363
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:00,562
Finally, he could
take it no more.

364
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,082
Hold still.

365
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,441
Hold still.

366
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:13,680
- Hold still!
- Paint faster!

367
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,643
Okay, I guess it's time.

368
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:21,110
Drop your shorts.

369
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,871
Yeah.

370
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,120
Wait, wait!

371
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,780
That wasn't enough buildup.
I need...

372
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:31,011
In a world without justice,
one man--

373
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:33,191
- Oh, just drop them!
- All right.

374
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:38,772
- No! No, this is not right!
- We had a deal!

375
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,702
Well, I'm going back on the deal.
Barney, get out!

376
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:42,452
- You...!
- It's over!

377
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,631
Lily, I can't let you
go through with this!

378
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:52,093
I found a castle we can stay in,
but it's an extra two grand.

379
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:53,903
It's just not right!

380
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:56,571
It's beautiful and
they say it's haunted.

381
00:17:56,587 --> 00:18:00,292
I can't let the woman I love
compromise her values for money!

382
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:03,260
I totally think we can get
some more money out of him.

383
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,952
I'm never letting my
fiancée, ever...!

384
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,471
Oh, you're still here?

385
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,691
Before you say anything,

386
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:10,231
I'll give you an
extra five grand.

387
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:11,520
We accept.

388
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,412
You people are so
easy to control.

389
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:18,682
Dance for me, puppets, dance.

390
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,672
And that's how Uncle Barney paid
for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.

391
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,272
Come on, Ted, listen,
why don't we get back

392
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,022
and finish drawing the
plans for a building

393
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,401
which, in my opinion,
is never going to get built,

394
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:33,152
so you and I can get out of here
and grab a couple of beers.

395
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:34,152
No.

396
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:37,611
Look, Hammond,
there's no easy way to say this but...

397
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:38,740
Looking for Hammond Druthers.

398
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,592
Oh, that's me.
I'm Hammond Druthers.

399
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,342
These are divorce papers.

400
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:45,952
You've been served.

401
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:47,593
Oh, God.

402
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,481
She's really going
through with this.

403
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,742
So that's it. It's over.

404
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,113
There is no easy way
to say this, but...

405
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:59,291
She's giving me the
remains of Wolfie?

406
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:01,731
My dog is dead?

407
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:04,452
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

408
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,710
She always played
too rough with him.

409
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:11,370
Believe me,
there is no easy way to say this--

410
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:15,712
- # Happy birthday to you... #
- You've got to be kidding me!

411
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:18,552
Guys, you have no idea how much
this means to me right now.

412
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:20,120
Wait, his birthday
was yesterday!

413
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:22,372
Yeah, but a bunch of us were up
at the conference in Montreal,

414
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:25,601
- so we thought...
- No! No birthday! No!

415
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:28,211
I got something to say
and I'm gonna get it out.

416
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:31,242
Hammond, listen to me.
I am sorry that your dog died,

417
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,770
and that your wife is
divorcing you and that...

418
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:36,261
your life is falling apart and that
these guys missed your birthday.

419
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:38,163
And there is no
easy way to say...

420
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,932
What are you doing?
What's going on?

421
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,432
Oh, God...

422
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,262
Oh, come on, you're not going
to pull that, are you?

423
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:49,293
Oh! Look, yeah, right.
Now we're falling onto the ground.

424
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:52,370
Well, nice try, but guess what?

425
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:54,180
You're fired!

426
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:57,362
You're fired--
you get it? You hear me?

427
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,133
You're gone! You're fired!

428
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:19,420
In my defense,
I think we all suspected Hammond

429
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,192
might have been faking.

430
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:26,753
On the plus side, the EMTs seem to
think he's going to be just fine

431
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,230
and, as you saw, they did admit that
I did not cause the heart attack,

432
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,790
even if they said it
a bit begrudgingly.

433
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,890
And there it was, rock bottom:

434
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,703
They all hated me.

435
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:41,781
But just when all seemed lost,

436
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:45,031
I had the greatest idea
of my entire career.

437
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,730
Margarita Fridays--
great idea, boss.

438
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:05,672
Okay, it's done.

439
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,032
I'm gonna step out,
so you can admire it.

440
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,842
Thank you very much, Lily.

441
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,852
Marshall, do you
have the money?

442
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,920
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here!

443
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:21,400
A smooth area?!
You gave me the Ken doll?!

444
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:27,533
She left out Little Barney.

445
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:30,503
Barnacle Junior.

446
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:33,490
My Barnana is...

447
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:37,320
Barnito Supreme.
