00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:03,871
In May of 2007,
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,285
at the historic Van Smoot
House in upstate New York.

3
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:10,723
Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.

4
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:14,116
Yeah. It's just how
I always pictured it.

5
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,055
Well, that was a load of crap.

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,939
You see, kids, when you get married,
you learn a hard lesson.

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,260
The wedding you set out to have is
almost never the wedding you end up with.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,596
So, we've decided on a small,
outdoor wedding,

9
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:27,884
just family and close friends.

10
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,740
No more than 25 people

11
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:32,130
in a beautiful
garden somewhere,

12
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,381
maybe an acoustic
guitar playing

13
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:36,115
while we walk down the aisle.

14
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,852
And maybe you already know someone
who went down to the courthouse

15
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,621
and registered as an officiant

16
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:42,620
so that he or she-- he--

17
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:44,261
could perform the ceremony.

18
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:47,231
But you hate marriage.
Why do you want to perform the ceremony?

19
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:50,672
Because it subtly implants in
the mind of every woman there

20
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:52,061
that when I ask a question,

21
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:53,641
you say, "I do."

22
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:55,861
Yeah.

23
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:58,242
The closer you get
to the big day,

24
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,573
the more concessions you make.

25
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:02,892
Great. Now my mom's making
me invite the Lessners.

26
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,023
This puts our numbers
in the triple digits.

27
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:11,050
Wow. I guess sometimes,
Lessner is more... ner.

28
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,643
You know how like
sometimes less is more.

29
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:15,880
Yeah. This is one of
those times, sweetie?

30
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:20,322
You know what? That's okay.
It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.

31
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:23,511
So it's not going to be an
outdoor wedding anymore.

32
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,541
Marshall's dad is convinced if we
have an outdoor wedding in New York,

33
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:31,161
he's going to get mugged,
so it's going to be inside now.

34
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:35,823
It'll be great. We're still going
to have our acoustic guitar player.

35
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:38,630
So now,
instead of an acoustic guitar,

36
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:40,483
we're having a harp player.

37
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:44,591
Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and...
that guy's daughter plays the harp.

38
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:48,391
Is she hot? I'd love to be able to
cross "harp player" off my list.

39
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,423
How long is this list?

40
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,662
Dude, I'm not gonna count
how many pages the list is.

41
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,130
I'm not crass.

42
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:57,921
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
She's pregnant.

43
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,102
Sweet! I can cross
off two things.

47
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:17,902
And the day arrives for Lily and
Marshall's very big indoor wedding...

48
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:19,312
with a harp.

49
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:20,531
Hi, Lily.

50
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,401
Wow. Andrea.

51
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:23,942
You really are pregnant.

52
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:24,763
Yeah.

53
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,270
How do you play the harp
with your belly so...?

54
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:30,123
Oh, I don't really--
I can only reach about half the strings.

55
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,373
You only play half the harp?

56
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:33,543
Yeah.

57
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,692
Oh, no. Uh, okay.
Lily, I will take care of this.

58
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:39,440
Um, I'll just pluck the other half.
Is it hard to learn?

59
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:41,560
I've been studying
the harp for 12 years.

60
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,422
Yeah, but I'm a fast learner.

61
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:46,032
You ever hear of "Guitar Hero"?
Learned that in a day.

62
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:47,381
Is there a "Harp Hero"?

63
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:48,850
Robin, it's fine.

64
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,031
So, so, when are you due?

65
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:51,952
Tuesday.

66
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:53,263
Wow, that's soon.

67
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:54,691
Last Tuesday.

68
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:57,901
Holy crap, we have to fire her.

69
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,832
She's gonna drop a shorty in
the middle of your ceremony.

70
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:03,853
Robin, I'm not going
to freak myself out.

71
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:05,390
I hate those women who say,

72
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,802
"Oh, my wedding
has to be perfect."

73
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:11,690
Things go wrong. Sometimes the
deejay screws up your playlist.

74
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:15,443
Sometimes you slip on placenta
during the recessional.

75
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,000
Can I grab a scotch
and soda real quick?

76
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:21,542
No. I'm not allowed to serve
anything until the reception.

77
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:24,112
Wow. You just cost
yourself a big tip, buddy.

78
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:26,692
I'm not allowed to
accept tips, buddy.

79
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:29,111
You allowed to
accept criticism?

80
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:32,333
You, sir, are an ass... buddy.

81
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,820
Hey, you want to know what line
doesn't work on a harp player?

82
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:38,843
"Hey, baby, want to pluck?"

83
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,821
Really? That didn't work.

84
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,201
Not even a little.

85
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,523
Hey! Who's Bill?

86
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:46,431
Bill?

87
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:49,203
Yeah. This guy came
up to me at the bar.

88
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,970
Can I ask you something?

89
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:55,350
Where in the ceremony is the place
where they ask if anyone objects?

90
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,393
Uh... Don't think
they do that anymore.

91
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,313
Oh, so when do you think
someone should do it?

92
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,360
Just wait for a lull or what?

93
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:06,462
Oh, no.

94
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:10,720
Did he look like a guy who tried
to be an umpire but failed?

95
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,082
He kind of did.

96
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,422
That's Scooter.

97
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,920
Your high school
boyfriend, Scooter?

98
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:18,553
His real name is Bill.

99
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:20,191
My mom must have invited him.

100
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:21,701
Why? Why would she do that?

101
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,470
Our families are really close.

102
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:24,901
But my ex-boyfriend?

103
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:26,242
Come on, Mom.

104
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:30,220
I didn't invite that professional
squash player Dad busted you with.

105
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,492
Oh, I need a glass of wine.

106
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:33,380
I'll get it.

107
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:35,472
Oh, thanks.
Hey, how's Marshall doing?

108
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:36,170
He's great.

109
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,431
He's about to get his hair cut.

110
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:40,371
Oh. I'm worried my cousin's
going to cut it too short.

111
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:43,122
Me, too. I was up all night.

112
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:45,133
Hello, Lily.

113
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:45,942
Hey, Bill.

114
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:47,022
Hey, Barney.

115
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,482
Scooter, what are
you doing here?

116
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:51,301
It's not "Scooter" anymore.

117
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:52,751
It's Bill.

118
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,332
A lot of things have
changed about me, Lily,

119
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,682
but one hasn't.

120
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:58,402
I still love you.

121
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:00,733
And I came here
to win you back.

122
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,412
You're really cute.
Oh, no. Really?

123
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:06,621
Lily, I-I know it's crazy,

124
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:08,541
but I love you,

125
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:10,902
and if you can
look me in the eye

126
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,760
and tell me that you
want to marry Marshall,

127
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:15,801
I will leave right now and
be out of your life forever.

128
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,131
I want...

129
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:20,530
I want...

130
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:22,710
Scooter!

131
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:24,053
I need a glass of wine.

132
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,180
And I need you to
get out of my face.

133
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:27,723
It's for the bride, so...

134
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,093
White or red?

135
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:30,333
White.

136
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:34,162
And, uh...
she'd also like a scotch and soda.

137
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:34,882
You got it.

138
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:37,430
She'd also like a bowl
of smoked almonds.

139
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,602
I don't have any,

140
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,990
but I guess I could run out
to the corner and get some.

141
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,802
Well, it's only the biggest
day of her life, so...

142
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,372
Let the games begin.

143
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,090
Here. Can't stay.
Got to try something.

144
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:56,060
Maybe my words won't
change your mind,

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,761
but maybe the words
of a poet will.

146
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:02,995
I read from "November Rain."

147
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,113
By W. Axl Rose.

148
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:06,800
That is a good song.

149
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:10,020
Barney said you needed me to
bounce some guy named Scooter?

150
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:13,861
What's up with Bill?

151
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,010
That's Scooter.

152
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:16,831
I'm on it.

153
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,132
- Hey.
- Hey.

154
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,283
Can I have your phone number?

155
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,622
No.

156
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,680
It's for the bride.

157
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,402
Oh. Hold on.
Let me go get a pen.

158
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:34,810
The bride wants
you to walk slower.

159
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:39,441
Oh, wow.

160
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:41,873
Oh. Robin...

161
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:43,763
My makeup looks
perfect right now,

162
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:46,401
and I'm about to cry.
Do something.

163
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,343
I have hairy nipples.

164
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:50,190
Really?

165
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:51,963
No, but it worked, didn't it?

166
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,113
Hey. Funny story.

167
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:55,892
I tackled this guy I
thought was Scooter.

168
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,521
Turns out it was
your photographer.

169
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:00,990
Don't worry. I got this sweet
camera phone, so we're covered.

170
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:03,642
There's a photographer?

171
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:04,713
Oh, my God.

172
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:07,230
- Okay, I just have to call...
- Robin, stop. Stop.

173
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:08,542
It's okay.

174
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:11,923
I am not gonna let
anything get to me today.

175
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,781
I just got a call from the florist.
The flowers won't be here

176
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:16,542
till halfway through
the ceremony.

177
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,263
I'm okay.

178
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:24,151
I hate to bother you, but... I think
I found your veil in the parking lot.

179
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:26,233
I'm fine.

180
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,840
Just FYI: my water broke.

181
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:31,323
But I can probably...

182
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,213
...make it through.

183
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:38,721
Totally cool.

184
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:42,252
Oh, no.

185
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:45,702
Lily, I think I forgot
your bridal panties.

186
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,732
I-I thought I had them.
I'm so sorry.

187
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,881
Oh, it's okay,
I'll just wear the ones I have on.

188
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:50,990
Are you sure?

189
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,111
I'm marrying Marshall today.

190
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:56,120
So it doesn't even matter that
I'm gonna walk down the aisle

191
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,591
without a veil in a room
that has no flowers

192
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:03,241
to the music of half a harp
played by a woman who's crowning,

193
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:06,683
as my high school boyfriend
reads Guns N' Roses lyrics.

194
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:07,853
But that's okay,

195
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,411
because there's no photographer there
to take any pictures of it anyway.

196
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:14,321
Lily, are you okay?

197
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,721
What do you think?!
Of course I'm not okay!

198
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:20,160
Everything that could possibly
go wrong at my wedding has!

199
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,403
It's ruined!

200
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:23,391
What happened to "I don't
want a perfect wedding"?

201
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:27,092
Oh, grow up, Robin!
Of course I want a perfect wedding!

202
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:32,141
Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not
to care about the wedding, but...

203
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:36,462
I do. I... I'm supposed to
feel like a princess today.

204
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,640
And you will.

205
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,980
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

206
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:42,981
Why don't we go outside? I have
something that'll make you feel better.

207
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:46,300
What could you have that could
possibly make me feel better?

208
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:54,003
God, I hope Marshall's having
a better day than I'm having.

209
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,430
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

210
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:58,873
Oh, my God.

211
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:00,791
Oh, my God.

212
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,272
- Oh, my God!
- What?

213
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,881
Well, it's not too short.

214
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:27,600
My hair! Look at my hair!
She ruined my hair!

215
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:29,841
I look like one of
the Backstreet Boys!

216
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:30,853
You totally do.

217
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,410
And not even the good
Backstreet Boys,

218
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,852
the older, lame dance move,
comeback tour Backstreet Boys.

219
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,543
The good Backstreet Boys?

220
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,693
Guys! Guys!
What am I gonna do?!

221
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:42,680
What-what the hell
happened to you?

222
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:44,442
Lily's cousin is
in beauty school,

223
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,340
and Lily didn't want
her to do her hair,

224
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,202
so she said she could do mine.

225
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:50,803
So, um,
just not-not too short, okay?

226
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:53,013
Oh, no,
we don't even have to cut it at all.

227
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:54,781
Could just give it some style.

228
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,993
Oh, okay, yeah, that's great.

229
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:58,643
'Cause, um, when it gets too short,
it starts to look weird.

230
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,883
And I don't want to look weird
when I'm up there, you know.

231
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,412
Ooh, I could give you
some cool guy tips.

232
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:06,382
I don't think I need
advice on how to be cool,

233
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,832
but yeah, great,
lay that on me.

234
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:12,760
I can't get married like this!
There's no way!

235
00:10:12,865 --> 00:10:14,270
Ah, let me see what I can do.

236
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:16,153
What? What can you do?

237
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:18,312
I have a superpower.

238
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,260
Lily is gonna kill me!

239
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,273
Look at me!

240
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:23,971
She's not gonna want
to marry me like this.

241
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:25,631
That's crazy.
Of course she will.

242
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:26,700
Would you marry me?

243
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:29,420
No. But not because of the hair.
It's because I have a rule:

244
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:32,350
never marry anyone you've
had a farting contest with.

245
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:36,370
Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily
and I shouldn't even get married?

246
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:40,812
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

247
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,513
It's for the bride.

248
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:48,400
One, the bride would...

249
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,260
like all of this tension
out of my shoulders.

250
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:54,032
And she would like, let's say,

251
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:56,820
you in the inappropriately
short dress to rub them.

252
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,200
Two...

253
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,522
What was two?

254
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,083
Okay, we have a
bit of a situation.

255
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,801
Let's not panic.

256
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,560
Let's just find a solution.

257
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:28,633
Dude, you shaved
your freakin' head.

258
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:30,670
Yeah, yeah, but it's good.

259
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:33,573
I ought to shave it all off.
What a great solution.

260
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:36,053
Just be bald 'cause
it's cool, right?

261
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:38,693
Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan,
Britney Spears...

262
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:40,850
Oh, God, what did I do?!

263
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:42,622
How could you let
me shave my head?!

264
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:44,380
- What?!
- You're the worst best man ever!

265
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,640
I hate you!

266
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:48,263
I'm not going out there!
I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.

267
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:50,291
I'm gonna go find that money
under the rock by the tree

268
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,500
and go live with the guys on
the beach in Zihautanejo.

269
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:53,600
Dude, those guys are criminals.

270
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:56,160
Only Red Andy was
falsely accused.

271
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,853
Ted, you're my best man!
You got to do something!

272
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:01,561
Okay, all right, come here.
Just breathe, breathe, all right?

273
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,742
Don't worry. Don't worry.

274
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:07,741
- I'll just... I'll take these.
- No!

275
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,573
- Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?
- Yes.

276
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:17,673
Yes, we're, we're having a little
bit of a problem back there.

277
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:19,732
Um, and I was wondering
if you could help us out.

278
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:20,690
Yeah.

279
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:25,951
Marshall accidentally
shaved part of his head.

280
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,680
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

281
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,660
Yeah, so here's what
I was thinking.

282
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:35,211
What if I found something
to cover up the bald area?

283
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,820
Yeah, that would probably work,

284
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:39,291
but with what?

285
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:42,421
That's a tough one.

286
00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:46,932
Maybe a wig of some
sort or a, um...

287
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,150
toupee.

288
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:50,162
Something that matches
his hair color,

289
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:54,913
which is, which is kind of the same
color as the top of your hair.

290
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,940
Mm, yeah.

291
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,733
Does anyone here wear a toupee?

292
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,551
Shouldn't be hard to find out.

293
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,083
Most of them are pretty bad.

294
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:06,631
That is true. That is true.

295
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:09,232
We just need to find
someone who wears a toupee

296
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,181
that is the same color

297
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:15,391
as Marshall's and your hair.

298
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:18,743
Boy, that's a
pretty tall order.

299
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:20,111
Really?

300
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:23,240
You can't think of any
place in the general area

301
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:25,572
where there might be a toupee of
the kind I'm describing to you?

302
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,812
No, not off the top of my...

303
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,281
No. Can't.

304
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,913
Let me come at this from a different
angle. I got $50 in my pocket

305
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:37,231
- which is probably a lot more...
- The bride needs this.

306
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:55,771
Actually, I think
it kinda works.

307
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,942
It totally does.

308
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:00,811
Barney?

309
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:05,122
To be honest, I'm, uh,

310
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:07,763
I'm jealous I don't
get to wear it.

311
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,531
Okay, problem solved.

312
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:17,582
Crisis averted.

313
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,220
Let's get me married.

314
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,090
It looks terrible, doesn't it?

315
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,390
It kinda looks like fur,

316
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,171
which gives you the appearance
of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.

317
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,280
- Oh, you know...
- In a bad way.

318
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,543
Hey. Cool hair, bro.

319
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:32,932
What happened to your shirt?

320
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:35,350
I got sauce on it when
I tackled the caterer.

321
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,172
You gonna put another shirt on?

322
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,182
No, I'm good.

323
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:39,902
Hey, you guys seen Scooter?

324
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:43,593
What? What? Scooter's here?
That guy's at my wedding?

325
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:45,323
Not for long, bro.

326
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:47,073
Not for long.

327
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,393
Okay, you know what?
I need some air.

328
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:54,651
I think we should go
for a walk, okay?

329
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,302
It would cover up the problem.

330
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:00,613
It's festive

331
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:03,582
and it celebrates the heritage
of this great nation.

332
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:06,102
Okay, unless you actually
have one in your car,

333
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,110
stop suggesting authentic
Native American headdress.

334
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:10,562
Oh, no.

335
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,633
Oh, my God!

336
00:15:13,908 --> 00:15:14,882
Marshall...

337
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,673
Lily, you're not
supposed to see me.

338
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:19,653
Holy crap, I don't think
anyone's supposed to see you.

339
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,153
What happened?
Did Amy do this to you?

340
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,990
Just the frosted tips.
I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby.

341
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:26,902
I've ruined the whole wedding,
haven't I?

342
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,250
Oh, no,
you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie.

343
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,743
It was already ruined.

344
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,552
There's no flowers,
no photographer.

345
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,410
Oh, and Scooter's here,
by the way.

346
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,391
Yeah, I know. I heard.

347
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:38,471
My veil got thrashed,
the harp player is in labor,

348
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,653
and I'm not wearing
my wedding underwear.

349
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:43,263
What? No "Property of
Marshall" across the back?

350
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,372
How are people going to
know whose butt that is?

351
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:47,120
What happened?

352
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:52,190
Remember the wedding we wanted,
the intimate outdoor ceremony?

353
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:54,043
I wish we could
have that wedding.

354
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:58,111
So do it.

355
00:15:58,217 --> 00:15:58,982
What?

356
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,461
Get married now.

357
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,880
Right here.

358
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:04,302
Look, it's outside like
you always wanted.

359
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:06,411
Intimate, close friends.

360
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:09,090
There's no guitar,
but it's pretty close.

361
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:10,973
Barney can officiate.

362
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,863
Yes. Yes, I can.

363
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:18,241
Uh, excuse me, guys.
You all dropped something:

364
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,592
your jaws--

365
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:24,111
because Barney Stinson is about
to aid and abet a marriage.

366
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,671
Could we even do that? I mean,
what about all those people in there?

367
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,811
Do that one, too.
And then when everything goes wrong,

368
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:32,882
you won't care because you already
had the real wedding out here.

369
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,380
What do you think, baby?

370
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,353
I love it.

371
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:39,650
Me, too.

372
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:42,751
Let's do it.
Let's get married before we get married.

373
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:44,131
Great.

374
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:46,140
Wait, hold on.

375
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,221
Excuse me, sir.

376
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:51,453
Could we borrow your hat?

377
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:53,662
Okay.

378
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,072
Thank you.

379
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,422
Hat.

380
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:07,073
We thought of authentic
Native American headdress

381
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,200
before we thought of hat.

382
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:12,792
Thank you all for coming.

383
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,562
For those of you
who don't know me...

384
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,930
I'm not the biggest
believer in marriage.

385
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:26,541
But... you two are so great together,
you know?

386
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:34,562
It's like you were, uh,
made for each other.

387
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,883
- He's gonna cry.
- No, I'm not.

388
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:44,320
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not, I'm not.

389
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:51,630
Lily and Marshall...

390
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:55,453
when everyone sees you, they...

391
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,611
see true love.

392
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,093
It's the best love...

393
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:10,433
Can we just, um,
move on to the rings or something?

394
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:15,052
Oh, no.

395
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:17,543
I don't have my vows.

396
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,072
I don't have mine either.

397
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:22,583
You don't need your vows.
Just say why you love each other.

398
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:26,611
Okay, I'll go first.

399
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:30,311
Lily,

400
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:33,830
there are a million
reasons why I love you.

401
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:36,170
You make me laugh

402
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,922
and you take care of
me when I'm sick.

403
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:44,033
You're sweet, caring and you even
created an egg dish and named it after me.

404
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:46,883
She puts a little Italian dressing in
scrambled eggs before she cooks them.

405
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,561
It's called "Eggs Marshall,"
and it's awesome.

406
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,061
But the main reason
that I love you is

407
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:56,093
that you're my
best friend, Lily.

408
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:59,102
You're, uh...
you're the best friend I ever had.

409
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:01,203
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- No problem.

410
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,583
It's totally okay.

411
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,191
My turn.

412
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,043
Oh, thank you.

413
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:12,870
Marshall, I love you
because you're funny

414
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:15,560
and you make me feel loved

415
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,323
and you make me feel safe

416
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:22,093
and for our anniversary you
gave me a sweatshirt that says,

417
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:25,473
"Lily and Marshall.
Rockin' It Since '96."

418
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,533
I kinda wish I was
wearing it right now

419
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:31,681
'cause it smells like you.

420
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:35,670
But the main reason I love you,
Marshall Ericksen,

421
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:38,701
is you make me happy.

422
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,473
You make me happy all the time.

423
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:48,282
Hey, I found your panties!

424
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:50,393
I'm good.

425
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:55,180
Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife
to have and to hold from this day forward?

426
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:56,030
- Slow down.
- I can't.

427
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:58,073
From this day forward so as
long as you both shall live?

428
00:19:58,107 --> 00:19:59,072
I do.

429
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:02,673
Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to
be your husband to have and to hold... live?

430
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:03,432
I do.

431
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,760
Okay, then,

432
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:08,823
by the power invested in me by
the very bitter old Pakistani man

433
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:11,423
who works down at the
courthouse on Lafayette Street,

434
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,830
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

435
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:16,792
You may kiss the bride.

436
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:26,161
- Do you smoke?
- No.

437
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:29,772
Wow. First lie of marriage.
That was fast.

438
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:34,780
After that, we all went back
inside for the second wedding.

439
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:36,830
And yes,
a lot of things did go wrong,

440
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:37,990
but it didn't matter

441
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:40,233
because when I look
back on that day,

442
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:42,273
what I remember is
the first wedding;

443
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,392
the intimate outdoor ceremony

444
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:46,151
with just close friends

445
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:48,160
and an acoustic guitar.

446
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,872
How do you feel?

447
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:03,060
Tired. I got
married twice today.

448
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,871
So where do you want to do it for
the first time as a married couple,

449
00:21:09,975 --> 00:21:12,760
nice hotel room or a
reception hall bathroom?

450
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,200
What do you think?

451
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,381
Bathroom, of course.

452
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:18,992
Please don't.

453
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,062
- Sorry, Ted.
- Sorry, Ted.

454
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:22,903
