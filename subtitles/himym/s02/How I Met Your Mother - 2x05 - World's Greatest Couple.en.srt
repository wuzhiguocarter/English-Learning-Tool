***********

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,630
In all the years we lived in new york,
none of us had ever set foot in his apartment.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,640
Until one day,
**********

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,210
it's a pretty good story.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,090
And believe it or not,
alcohol did not play a role.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,870
It all started two weeks earlier
at lily's housewarming.

7
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,370
Welcome to my new home.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,600
Oh,wow,lily,this is...

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,620
oh,this is all of it.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,820
Yeah,I know it's small,
but it's got character. Thank you.

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,360
And I am learning lithuanian
from my neighbors.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,370
They're great.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,890
They're always out there
in the hall,you know,

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,690
cooking and gambling and giving
each other haircuts. It's nice.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,340
Hey,is that a toilet
in your kitchen?

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,620
Or a stove
in your bathroom?

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,080
Oh,that's not
just a stove.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,750
That's a stovenkerator:

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,680
A combination of a stove,
oven and sink and refrigerator.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,060
Stovenkerator.

21
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,170
- Isn't that futuristic?
- God,I hope not.

22
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,620
Hey,cool murphy bed.

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,560
Yeah,it's kind of a mess.
I didn't make my bed this morning,so...

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,290
oh!

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,750
You know what,I bet sleeping at this angle
is good for you.

26
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,150
For some reason.

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,830
I got it.

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,610
that was,something,something,

29
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,040
I am going to,something,you
like a,something,donkey.

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,030
Other cultures.

31
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey,let's break out
the fruit basket.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,050
Hey,who ate all the...?

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,280
 Lily
out of that apartment.

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,350
Her roommate is a raccoon.

38
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,550
I'd offer her my place,
but I've got dogs and she's allergic.

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,740
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend.
I think she's a little more allergic to that.

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,500
What about your place,barney?I know it's 
shrouded in mystery,but it's gotta have a couch.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,930
The fortress of barnitude?
No way.

42
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,200
Come on.
She's desperate.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,820
Hmm,normally a prerequisite
for the women I bring home,but... pass.

44
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,270
One of you guys is very,
very lucky because I have...

45
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,970
a boom,an extra ticket to the 
alanis morissette concert. Who's in?

46
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,420
- Absolutely not.
- No.

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,400
Damn! I got these tickets,
like,months ago for me and lily

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,280
and now I can't find
anyone to go with me.

49
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,750
This is what I miss
about being in a couple.

50
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,660
I always had someone
to go to concerts with,

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,770
or farmer's market,
or brunch.

52
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,440
God,I miss brunch!

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,380
Well,I guess you could--
well,you could try going to brunch alone.

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh,you don't
think I've tried?

55
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,160
- Table for one.
- One couple?

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,870
Um,no,just me.

57
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,020
Really? For brunch?

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,780
You're right. Who am I kidding?

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,760
Ooh,the popover pantry.That place is great.
Can we go get brunch tomorrow?

60
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,190
- Of course,sweetie.
- Can I go with you guys?

61
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,110
Really? For brunch?

62
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,180
God,I hate being single!

63
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,770
Okay,I'll take the over
on the pittsburgh game.

64
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,060
Oh,and P. To the S.,I never got my payout
from seattle from two weeks ago.

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,240
Yeah. Don't make me call
the gaming commission on you.

66
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm sure they'd be very interested
to know what's going on over there.

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,810
All right? All right?

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,130
Okay,I love you,too,mom.
Take care.

69
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,830
Hello,lily.

70
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,690
You've somehow managed
to circumvent my security.

71
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,620
How did you do it?

72
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,100
- Ted gave me your spare key.
- Spare key,brilliant!

73
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,650
I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here
if I had no other choice.

74
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,050
But earlier today,I was getting
ready to go to sleep and...

75
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,500
sveikas.

76
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,590
That's terrible.

77
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,530
Well,see ya.

78
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,630
Well,can i
stay here maybe?

79
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,120
I'd let you,
but I don't have any room.

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,250
You live in a two-bedroom
apartment.

81
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,140
You have one room
just for your suits.

82
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,170
Hey,I'm at a point in my life
where my suits are my family.

83
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,240
Look around you,lily.

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,690
You are in the heart
of bachelor country,

85
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,110
and as a woman,you are
an illegal immigrant here.

86
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,130
Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa,
but that only lasts 12 hours.

87
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,060
14 if you qualify
for multiple entry.

88
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,340
is something
some lame,judgmental chick would say,

89
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,140
but I say give me
multiple high fives.

90
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,560
you really are desperate.

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,180
I really am.

92
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,760
Okay,you can stay
here for two days.

93
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,470
but I only have
one rule.

94
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,640
You can't change anything.

95
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,340
Why would I change anything?
This place is...

96
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,610
...perfect.

97
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,210
Except for the fact
that you don't have a tv.

98
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,100
See that wall?

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,090
300-inch flat-screen.

100
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,930
They only sell them in japan,
but I know a guy.

101
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,310
Had to ship it over
in a tugboat like freakin' king kong.

102
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,900
It hurts my eyes.

103
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,640
Yeah. That doesn't
go away.

104
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,840
Hey.
Hey,where have you been?

105
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,170
- The alanis morissette concert.
- By yourself?

106
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,640
No,actually I went
with a friend from law school.

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,550
Oh,really?
Who's this friend?

108
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,290
Brad.

109
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,010
Bro,alanis morissette rocks!

110
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,740
Totally! I can't believe
I almost didn't come tonight.

111
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,980
Let me guess: You bought the tickets
for you and lily right before she dumped you.

112
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,160
Yeah,how'd you know?

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,810
I just got dumped myself.

114
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,180
What,kara
broke up with you?

115
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,410
I'm sorry,man.
That sucks.

116
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,510
Brad,do you
like brunch?

117
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,900
You invited him
to brunch?

118
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,340
Yeah,I invited him to brunch.
Why,is that weird?

119
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,780
Yes. That's why I was all,
"you invited him to brunch?"

120
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,940
Why can't two guys
who are friends go to brunch?

121
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,460
Because brunch
is kind of...

122
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,920
girly.

123
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,730
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.
Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?

124
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,710
I don't know.
There's nothing girly about a horse.

125
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,910
Nothing girly about a horn,
but put them together and you get a unicorn.

126
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,460
I don't care what
either of you say,

127
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,760
I am going
to the popover pantry with brad.

128
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,830
We're here. We're hungry.
Get used to it,brunch.

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,350
- smells delicious.
- Thank you.

130
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,840
There was no food in the fridge,
so I picked up...

131
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,920
what are you doing?

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,780
Lily,what was the
first rule again?

133
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,680
- Don't change anything?
- And what was the second rule?

134
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,760
There was no second rule.

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,620
Exactly! There was only one rule
and you broke it.

136
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,080
I bought groceries.
That counts as changing something?

137
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,300
Lily,if I wanted a fridge
full of groceries,or fresh coffee in the morning,

138
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,340
I'd be in a relationship.

139
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,600
But I don't want to be
in a relationship.

140
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,700
That's why I make it crystal-clear
to every girl that walks through that door

141
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,880
that this is not a place
to leave a toothbrusH.

142
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,430
This is not a place to leave
a contact lens case.

143
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,840
This is a place
to leave.

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,100
Come on,I'll give you a tour.
Uh,no flash photography,please.

145
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,580
Bienvenido to the bedroom.

146
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,500
Dig this: King-sized bed,
full-sized blanket,one pillow.

147
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,880
Everything about this bed says,
"our work here is done."

148
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,210
Next we say "bienvenue"
to the bathroom.

149
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,940
What,only one towel?
What,no hairdryer?

150
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,840
You know where I keep that stuff?
Your place. Beat it.

151
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,760
And the coup de grace...

152
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,640
yeah,that's right.

153
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,320
Patent-pending.

154
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,810
And wilkommen to the hallway.

155
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,210
While guys like ted and marshall may
hide their porn...

156
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,770
marshall doesn't have porn.

157
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,600
Aww,that's sweet.

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,820
While guys like ted and marshall may
hide their porn,I had mine...

159
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,590
professionally lit.

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,410
Girls see this,
they can't get out of here fast enough.

161
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,620
And if that doesn't drive them away,
there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.

162
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,900
No,that's just awesome.

163
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,060
So you see,
whenever a girl wakes up here,

164
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,720
I never have to tell her
to go build her nest somewhere else.

165
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,070
My apartment
does it for me.

166
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,960
God,I love brunch.

167
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,510
Oh,damn...

168
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,280
the zucchini bread
is "ridonculous."

169
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,460
This isn't weird,right?

170
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,110
I sort of thought
it might be,but it totally isn'T.

171
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,450
And b-t-dub,you totally
did not oversell the eggs benny.

172
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,020
Right?

173
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,940
I mean,why can't two single bros go out
and rock brunch sunday morning-style?

174
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,980
Exactly. Thank you,that's
exactly what I've been saying.

175
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,830
- This must be destiny.
- What are you talking about?

176
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,410
I have two tickets
for mamma mia friday night.

177
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,600
You like abba,right? What am I saying?
Who doesn't?

178
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,350
Anyway,I was gonna take kara,
but now it's all you and me.

179
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,780
We're gonna do broadway,
bro style. What do you say?

180
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,590
Yeah!

181
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,170
Hey. Did the
cold wake you?

182
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,890
No,I've just been
watching you sleep.

183
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,680
Oh,did you try and take a shower?
I'm sorry,I only have one clean towel.

184
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,260
I don't buy into the myth
that we need to shower every day.

185
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,910
Okay.

186
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,940
I'd offer you some coffee,
but I don't have any,so you're gonna have to...

187
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,340
I'm boycotting coffee.

188
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,780
You may as well drink the tears
of a colombian peasant farmer.

189
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,410
God,I love this place.

190
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,020
Good thing I don't have a job
because I could stay here all day.

191
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,500
I think I left something
on the bookshelf.

192
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,680
Whoops.
Oh,no,oh,look.

193
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh,I'm disgusting.

194
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,360
Wow,you're open about your sexuality
and that's one of the reasons I love you.

195
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,710
Did I just say that?
Oh,well,cat's out of the bag.

196
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,780
I love you.

197
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,790
okay,beep,beep.
Backing up,um...

198
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,490
hi,barney. Oh...

199
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,470
oh,my god.
Are you married? Is this your wife?

200
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,690
What? No.
Yes!

201
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,680
- Yes?
- Yes.

202
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,430
You son of a bitch!

203
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,810
I can't believe I let you
enter my sacred temple.

204
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,380
- Come on,baby. please,no.you don't understand.
- Oh,dawn,you can find...

205
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,600
what have I done? This is the worst.
How could you...?

206
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,500
You're not going anywhere.
Live claritin clear.

207
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,340
That was close.
That hippie chick wouldn't leave.

208
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,070
She was ready to squat here.

209
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,340
Well,she'd have to with your spring-loaded
toilet seat,wouldn't she?

210
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,320
She was freakishly immune to
everything in my apartment... except you.

211
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,770
- You're better than porn.
- Thank you?

212
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,540
How would you like to
extend your stay here?

213
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,760
All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife,
and scare off the occasional one-night stand.

214
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,480
I know,I know. You've got your ethics.
You've got your principles...

215
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,800
- I'll do it.
- Really?

216
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,940
Barney,you've clearly got
some serious mother issues

217
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,950
that have left you the emotional equivalent
of a scavenging sewer rat.

218
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,280
But,in my
other apartment,

219
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,830
I would be living with an actual scavenging
sewer rat,so you win.

220
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,790
I'll take it.

221
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,400
- Mamma mia?
- Mamma mia.

222
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,470
You know what? It's supposed
to be a great musical,okay?

223
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,380
It won all sorts
of tonys and stuff.

224
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,000
No,totally. It sounds like a really,really
fun,exciting,third date.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,900
Ooh,third date.
You know what that means.

226
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,220
it is not a date,okay.
It's just two bros taking in a broadway show.

227
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,790
You bros going to get
dinner beforehand?

228
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,480
- We might grab a steak,yeah.
- Where at?

229
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,990
Cafe l'amour.

230
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,080
Brad says the food is
really good there,okay.

231
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,600
Sounds like brad's got quite
the night planned out.

232
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,060
You better bring your "a" game.
That means no granny panties.

233
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
All right,
you know what?

234
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,560
You two are just threatened because 
I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' turf.

235
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,060
Well,guess what?
It's my territory now.

236
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,680
I'm peeing all over brunches,
fancy dinners and musicals.

237
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,240
That's right; brad and i
are taking back broadway.

238
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
What are you going to wear?

239
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,650
I was thinking like this
collared shirt and these pin...

240
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,230
oh,you know what? Shut up.

241
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,890
Can you pass
the arts and leisure?

242
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,770
Can you pass
the arts and leisure?

243
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,340
- I just did.
- Honey,I'M...

244
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,920
barney,
what the hell is going on here?

245
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,570
- Lily,I can explain...
- how could you?

246
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,940
In our own home?
You bastard!

247
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,830
- I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...
- just get out.

248
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:23,200
This is what I get after I worked as a stripper
for four years to put you through medical school?

249
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,730
I got breast implants for you.
I...

250
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,440
I was just about
to turn on the tears.

251
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,530
Brava.

252
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,520
That was incredible.

253
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,710
And that slap was genius.
You did not hold back.

254
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,520
Yeah,that I just
always wanted to do.

255
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,460
Fair enough.

256
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,140
I have to say,it's kind of nice having food
around here for a change.

257
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,280
You know...
nah,never mind.

258
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,250
What? You're my wife.
You can tell me anything.

259
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,160
Well,if you really wanted
to sell this ruse,

260
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,660
we should try to make
this place a little more...

261
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,200
you know,homey. Like-like a woman
would actually live here.

262
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,140
What did you have in mind?

263
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,440
Bones,bones,

264
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,780
brittle little bones

265
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,250
it's not the milk you seek

266
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,780
it's the sun you need

267
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,810
sugar dumpling,muffin baby

268
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,180
this world is going crazy

269
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,270
do do do do

270
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,400
do do do do

271
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,880
do do do do do

272
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,610
Hey,you're home.

273
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,860
I didn't think we'd be seeing you
until tomorrow morning.

274
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,410
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It wasn't a date.

275
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,780
Okay,it was a date
and it got way weird.

276
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,040
- Oh,you really don't have to do that.
- No,I insist.You're my guest.

277
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,210
Thanks,brad.

278
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,540
Bro,

279
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,200
you got some chocolate
on your chin.

280
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,330
Still there.
I'll get that bad boy.

281
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,570
Well,it could have been worse.
It could have fallen in your lap.

282
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,880
It gets worse.

283
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,120
No,I-I can do it,brad.
Okay,thank you.

284
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,550
So anyway,ah,it's this saturday.
Do you want to come?

285
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,740
You want me to go to
a wedding with you?

286
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,470
Okay,that's not too bad.

287
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,370
Two single guys on the prowl.
It'll be likewedding crashers.

288
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,130
Just keep brad away
from the bouquet.

289
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,020
It gets worse.

290
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,530
It gets better.The foliage
in vermont this time of year is ridonc.

291
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,730
Vermont?

292
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,580
Yeah,the wedding's
at this awesome b&B.

293
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,830
Kara and I used to go there.

294
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,500
Anyway,
there is one room left,and we got it.

295
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,430
Walt whitman suite,bro.

296
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,790
- You said no,right?
- Of course.

297
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,860
- I understand.
- It's cool.

298
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,490
It's the first time I was going
to see my college friends since kara left me.

299
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,720
I just...

300
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,740
I just miss her so much.

301
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,670
I'll go to vermont with you.

302
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,150
That's great!

303
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,010
You know,uh,they're
registered at pottery barn.

304
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,400
I figure we could go
halfsies on a gravy boat.

305
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,730
I'm sorry.
It's not funny anymore.

306
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,740
Damn you,brunch!

307
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,730
This guy's crazy,right?

308
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,750
Look,I don't think
he's crazy.

309
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,260
I just think he's suffering
from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.

310
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,980
And unfortunately,
you're his nicotine patch.

311
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,790
And now you have to do
what every dysfunctional couple has to do:

312
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,090
Break up.

313
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,900
You're right.You're right.I promised brad I would 
go to the wedding with him,and then that is it .

314
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,500
Good man.

315
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,900
Oh,I think we made the right decision
going for the custom-made italian sheets.

316
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey,if my bed's going suit up,
it's going to do it right.

317
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,500
Want to give it a whirl?

318
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,490
Oh.

319
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,530
all right,I'm going to head out,hit the bars.
What are you going to do tonight?

320
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,550
Oh,I was just going
to watch letterman

321
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,730
but,god this bed is so comfy.

322
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,510
I wish you had a tv in here.

323
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,960
Okay,seriously,
what do you do for a living?

324
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,080
Please.

325
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,900
I thought
you were going out.

326
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,520
Eh.
After the monologue.

327
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,260
The next morning,
as the sun rose over manhattan,

328
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,260
your uncle marshall headed over to brad's 
apartment to leave for the wedding in vermont.

329
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,250
But when he got there...

330
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,080
no.

331
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,220
No...

332
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,010
no.

333
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,550
No!

334
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,680
No.

335
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,700
Ted.

336
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,390
Um,brad got me flowers.

337
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,570
Hold on.
Brad got him flowers.

338
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,090
I'm sorry.
It just got funny again.

339
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,560
Oh,hey...no,brad,uh,
I don't want to hear it.

340
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,420
I do like you.
And calla lilies are my favorite flower.

341
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,940
I don't know how you knew that.
I guess you just get me,but this is not cool,man.

342
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,110
I can't believe
that you would...

343
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,800
- hey,sweetie.
- Hey.

344
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,710
- Hey,marshall.
- Hi,kara.

345
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,330
So you guys,are like,
back together now?

346
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,690
Yeah.
Happened last night.

347
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,620
Uh,I'm sorry,bro.
I should have called you.

348
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,840
Yeah,you should have.

349
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,000
- Well,I didn't mean to hurt...
- don't,brad.

350
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,690
Just don'T.

351
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,870
There was something
in the air that night

352
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,380
the stars went bright

353
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,560
oh,what was with him?

354
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,430
I don't know.

355
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,380
I think he's in love with me.

356
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,280
I can't believe we just...
you and I...

357
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,880
- what have we done?
- Nothing.Nothing happened.

358
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,280
We-we just went to sleep.

359
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,590
Just went to sleep?I don't sleep
in the same bed as a woman and not make a move.

360
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,680
How could... you.
You spooned me against my will.

361
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,010
Hey,it takes two to cuddle.

362
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,100
We...

363
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,140
we...

364
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,990
we redecorated my place.

365
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,070
We stayed in on a friday night
to watch letterman,

366
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,340
and then slept together
and didn't have sex?

367
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,980
Oh,my god,
we're in a relationship.

368
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,200
That's what you think
a relationship is?

369
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,460
You were supposed to be the vaccine,
but you gave me the disease.

370
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,660
You gotta go.

371
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,830
Barney.

372
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,770
I don't think you're mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.

373
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,430
You let down your guard,
and let someone into your life,

374
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,240
and-and it actually felt okay.

375
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,150
And that terrifies you.

376
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,680
You gotta go.

377
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,070
Hey,you can't just kick me out!
I put a lot of work into this place,

378
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,260
and I've grown accustomed
to a certain standard of living.

379
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,150
A certain standard of living?
You didn't paya single...

380
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,820
and so mr. And mrs. Stinson,after two weeks 
of marriage,decided to call it quits.

381
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,160
Fortunately,
they reached a settlement.

382
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,060
And that's the story
of how aunt lily furnished her apartment.

383
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,950
Ynto brad again some time later.

384
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,800
Oh,my god,
it's brad.

385
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,850
Laugh like I said
something really funny.

386
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,520
- Right,right.
- That's was great.

387
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,030
- Hey,marshall.
- Oh,hey,hey,how's it going?

388
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,700
It's good.

389
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,730
Hey,I'm,uh...

390
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,240
yeah,I know
who you are.

391
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,000
Well,I got to go.
I got this thing.

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah,me too,
but more important.

393
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,210
- So,I guess I'll see you around.
- Sure. Sure.
