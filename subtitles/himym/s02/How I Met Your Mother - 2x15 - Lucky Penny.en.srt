1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,888
Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,719
Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing

3
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:09,119
can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.

4
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:11,987
Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,803
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:16,696
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:18,975
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,574
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,135
Why was this flight
so important?

10
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,300
Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.

11
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,888
I had just sold my first
building design and become

12
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:32,682
the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.

13
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:34,912
Suddenly I was
being headhunted.

14
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,493
One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.

15
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,640
They were flying me in
for a final interview

16
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:42,700
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.

17
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,652
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

18
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:46,090
It was my destiny.

19
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:47,831
There was just one problem.

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,960
Hi, wait, two more.

21
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:51,802
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

22
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:54,061
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

23
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:57,002
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.

24
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:59,161
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

25
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:01,330
Except for that guy.

26
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:06,492
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

27
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:07,620
I'm sorry, sir.

28
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,833
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

29
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:13,161
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

30
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,342
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night

31
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,942
dreaming about being a...

32
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,311
I mean, uh...

33
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,423
This is a cool job.

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,223
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

35
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:25,612
I'll see what I can do.

36
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,012
But it doesn't look good.

37
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:27,922
Thanks.

38
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,762
Your uniforms are pretty.

41
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:58,582
Okay.

42
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:01,050
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

43
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:03,421
It's up to the captain now
and they're calling us back.

44
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,621
Great, please let us know
soon as you hear anything.

45
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:07,860
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

46
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,480
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

47
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,431
not, you know,
one minute after.

48
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:14,111
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

49
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:16,441
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

50
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:19,003
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

51
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:21,030
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

52
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:24,320
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

53
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:27,212
Hello?

54
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,043
Oh, that is great news.

55
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:34,142
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

56
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,153
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

57
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,440
Where was it?

58
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,053
That thing better
have call waiting.

59
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:42,632
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

60
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:43,970
It's down to three people

61
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:46,140
and I know they need to
make their decision today.

62
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:49,531
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

63
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,413
I'm so stupid.

64
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:54,521
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

65
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:57,221
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

66
00:02:57,238 --> 00:03:00,103
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

67
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,570
She had a point.

68
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:03,370
It was kind of Barney's fault.

69
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:05,161
Let's back up a few months.

70
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,773
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

71
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,372
Oh, man, it kills.

72
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:10,973
You  want some aspirin, baby?

73
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:13,091
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

74
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,463
Wow, your first broken bone.

75
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:19,363
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

76
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,070
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

77
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,550
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

78
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,210
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

79
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,713
I can summon
incredible strength.

80
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,492
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

81
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,363
There was a really heavy door.

82
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,771
He opened it.

83
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:36,951
On one pull.

84
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:41,470
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

85
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:42,880
Yeah. It sucks,

86
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:46,260
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

87
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:48,200
Training for a marathon.

88
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:50,693
What?

89
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:53,531
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

90
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:55,322
You're kidding, right?

91
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:58,092
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

92
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:01,043
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

93
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:02,820
and just run the New
York City Marathon?

94
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,011
Absolutely.

95
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:07,070
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.

96
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:09,530
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

97
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,680
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

98
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:13,523
Here's how you run a marathon.

99
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:16,143
Step one, you start running.

100
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,390
There is no step two.

101
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,073
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

102
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,071
Take my number and
run in my place.

103
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:26,473
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

104
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:27,822
50 bucks?

105
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:29,713
Gee, Grandpa, if I win,

106
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,261
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

107
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:34,891
Make it $10,000.

108
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,251
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

109
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:38,731
Fine, then no bet.

110
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:40,213
Okay, $50.

111
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,983
The next morning,
as the marathon began,

112
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:47,183
we were focused on
Marshall's computer.

113
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:49,752
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

114
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,761
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

115
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,723
Ooh, he's starting!

116
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,672
This ought to be good.

117
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,082
Wow.

118
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:06,203
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

119
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:08,611
This tracking thing is amazing.

120
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:10,972
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

121
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:19,742
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

122
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:21,851
He's gotta be cheating, okay.

123
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,071
He knew we'd check.

124
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:24,690
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

125
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,151
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

126
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,763
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

127
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:34,203
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

128
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:37,453
and up First Avenue within 
the next hour or so. But...

129
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:40,002
there is no way that
that's really him.

130
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:41,481
It's really him.

131
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:51,103
Hey! That's mine.

132
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:53,212
Yeah, you'd better run!

133
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:59,440
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

134
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,742
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

135
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:03,580
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

136
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:06,571
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

137
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:09,143
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

138
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:10,340
I  won.

139
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:13,931
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

140
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,200
So where's my 50 bucks?

141
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:18,492
All right.

142
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:22,492
I got to admit,
you earned this.

143
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:27,290
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

144
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:29,298
Anyway, I'm heading home.

145
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,242
Might go hit the gym.

146
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:34,142
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get

147
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,871
to use the subway
for free today.

148
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:39,243
Wow.  You know I really should
check out this "subway."

149
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,610
Heard so much about it.

150
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,993
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

151
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:45,853
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

152
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:48,343
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

153
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,443
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

154
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:51,780
No.

155
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:57,013
So Barney did it.

156
00:06:57,028 --> 00:06:58,471
He actually finished
the marathon.

157
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:01,920
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.

158
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:03,633
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

159
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:06,063
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

160
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:07,803
What, what are
you talking about?

161
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:10,711
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

162
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,203
Finisher.

163
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:21,332
Yeah, you know what I mean.

164
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:23,332
86th street.

165
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:47,183
My legs don't work.

166
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,213
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

167
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,302
I've seen where
it turns around.

168
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:55,791
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

169
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,400
Barney's legs won't work.

170
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:01,020
He's riding the subway
from end to end

171
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,191
because he physically
can't get off the train.

172
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,183
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

173
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,641
Listen to me, Ted.

174
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,642
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

175
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:11,963
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

176
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,882
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

177
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:17,002
All right. I'll be right there.

178
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:18,562
Stay where you are.

179
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,421
Ted, Ted.

180
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:42,790
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

181
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,942
I'm sorry. I can't.

182
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:48,293
Douche.

183
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:06,532
- Barney?!
- Ted!

184
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:11,022
Hey!

185
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,790
No...!

186
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,680
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

187
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,431
you never would have
jumped that turnstile,

188
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:23,471
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,

189
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,180
and we would have
made this flight.

190
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,481
You're right.

191
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:28,341
Everything can be
traced back to him.

192
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,281
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

193
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:34,012
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

194
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:38,022
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

195
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,891
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

196
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:42,300
Ma, can I call you back?

197
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,390
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

198
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:46,792
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

199
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:49,062
Looks like your
flight left already.

200
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,692
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

201
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:53,220
Well, he never even
called you back?

202
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:55,822
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

203
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:57,922
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

204
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,642
at a Radisson in Orlando.

205
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:07,723
It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me

206
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:10,100
to Chicago on time
for my job interview,

207
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,703
but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.

208
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:14,731
What was the name of
the airline again?

209
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,591
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

210
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:17,712
Was the "R" backwards?

211
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,052
God, I hope not.

212
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:22,482
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

213
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,720
More like dumb carts.

214
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:27,133
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

215
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:30,662
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

216
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,970
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

217
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,153
What, you think
this is my fault?

218
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:40,630
For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.

219
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,672
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

220
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:46,272
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

221
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:52,972
I cannot allow this.

222
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,170
What?

223
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,481
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

224
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:12,091
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

225
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,053
two to four hours
before a big run.

226
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,430
Try a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

227
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:20,401
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

228
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:23,151
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

229
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,983
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

230
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:28,913
Liquids are digested faster.

231
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:30,933
That way, no energy is wasted,

232
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:33,591
and it's all about the run.

233
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:07,731
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

234
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,873
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

235
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:15,341
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

236
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,833
You are a robot sent
from the future

237
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,750
to win the marathon!

238
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,900
You are... Marshall.

239
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,692
You are... Marshall.

240
00:12:28,735 --> 00:12:32,900
You are Marshall! Yeah!

241
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:42,150
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

242
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,781
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

243
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:49,703
Try using some petroleum 
jelly on the affected areas."

244
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:11,073
Oh, gosh!

245
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,483
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

246
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:33,453
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

247
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,493
You're the best.

248
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,681
You look good.

249
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,643
Nobody does it better than you.

250
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,290
Marshall? Oh, my God!

251
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,920
So, yes, it was your fault.

252
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:49,202
I  mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

253
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:51,892
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

254
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,763
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

255
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:56,022
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

256
00:13:58,107 --> 00:14:00,901
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

257
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,693
That really wasn't my fault.

258
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,251
I  wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

259
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:06,660
Hey, think about it.

260
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:08,673
Hey, what's going on here?

261
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,721
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.

262
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:12,053
Yeah, but for what?

263
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,292
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

264
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:16,023
to give you some indication.

265
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,851
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

266
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:22,021
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

267
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,091
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

268
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:28,232
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

269
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,391
We have to camp out.

270
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,270
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

271
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,691
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

272
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,693
but I never knew where it was.

273
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:40,300
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

274
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,570
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

275
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,760
- What thing?
- A penis.

276
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:48,670
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

277
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:51,760
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

278
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:53,042
Vera Wang!

279
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:57,123
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

280
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:58,883
You said wang.

281
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:05,291
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

282
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:07,100
Only fewer mullets.

283
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:11,892
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

284
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,832
Ooh, this is comfy.

285
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:19,300
We might actually
be able to sleep.

286
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,402
That's kind of annoying.

287
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:26,672
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

288
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,312
I don't think I can take this.

289
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,770
Every time it turns off,
I think,

290
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:46,771
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

291
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,003
but then it does.

292
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,531
Why does it, Robin?

293
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,720
Why does it keep turning on?

294
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:54,773
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

295
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,553
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

296
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,122
Why don't we sing along?

297
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:21,851
If we get through this,

298
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:25,332
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

299
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:29,640
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

300
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:32,942
Morning, ladies.

301
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:37,902
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

302
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:50,542
The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,

303
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,870
so while I was at work,

304
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,453
she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,

305
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:56,770
and that's when...

306
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:59,251
Nobody does it better than you.

307
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,910
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

308
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:05,470
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

309
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:07,180
we would have made
the first flight.

310
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,872
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

311
00:17:10,018 --> 00:17:13,982
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

312
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:16,052
Oh, my God!

313
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,482
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

314
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,240
Yes, yes, I am.

315
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,220
I can't believe
you recognized me.

316
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,633
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

317
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:26,961
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

318
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:29,940
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

319
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:32,180
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

320
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,263
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

321
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:36,592
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

322
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:39,672
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

323
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:42,670
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

324
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:46,001
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

325
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,702
two seats on that next flight.

326
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:52,563
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.

327
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,502
Let me see what I can find out.

328
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:57,231
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

329
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,773
I think it might hurt.

330
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:04,193
This is such a nightmare.

331
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,320
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

332
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,630
for a wedding dress?

333
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:11,431
No.

334
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,450
Wait. It goes back further. 

335
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:16,403
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

336
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:29,033
1939?!

337
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,093
This penny's from 1939!

338
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:36,883
A 67-year-old penny.

339
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:39,811
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

340
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:43,141
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

341
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,952
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

342
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,991
and  this baby is worth
something to a collector.

343
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,143
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

344
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:52,442
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner

345
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,182
with the money I get
for this little guy.

346
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,651
And that's exactly what I did.

347
00:18:56,706 --> 00:19:00,272
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

348
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:03,343
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

349
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:06,893
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

350
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,412
1984.

351
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:12,223
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

352
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:13,782
How dare you.

353
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,691
Hey, what's going on?

354
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:17,380
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

355
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:18,881
Yeah, but for what?

356
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:21,083
It was me.

357
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,013
I started this.

358
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,942
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

359
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,820
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

360
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:30,281
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

361
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,241
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

362
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:35,462
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

363
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:37,720
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

364
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:39,881
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

365
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:41,901
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

366
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:44,420
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

367
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,500
And we would have
made our flight.

368
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:49,181
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

369
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,931
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

370
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:52,363
I wish I did.

371
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:54,263
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

372
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:56,962
losing a sweet penny like that.

373
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,841
Uh, sir?

374
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:01,551
Oh, please tell me you
have some good news.

375
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,361
Uh, I'm afraid not.

376
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,432
There are no extra
seats on the plane.

377
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:06,730
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,600
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

379
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:10,622
I can't believe this.

380
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:13,411
That's it, it's over.

381
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:14,930
Ted, come on.

382
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:18,323
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.

383
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:21,270
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

384
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,143
But that's not what happened.

385
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:24,953
They didn't reschedule.

386
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,833
They hired someone else.

387
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:29,380
And as it turned out,
three months later,

388
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:32,670
that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.

389
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:35,061
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

390
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:37,540
I thought I was destined
to get that job.

391
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:38,870
But I was wrong.

392
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:41,450
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

393
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,712
Because if I hadn't,

394
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,872
I never would have
met your mother.

395
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:16,823
