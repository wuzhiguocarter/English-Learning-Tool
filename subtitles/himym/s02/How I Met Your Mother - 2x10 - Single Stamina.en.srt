00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,450
Kids,
there's nothing   more wonderful   
than new york city   in the winter...

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,360
except   the view of new york city   
in the winter   through your apartment window.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,950
In the winter of 2006,

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,900
marshall,lily,robin and I were all deep   
in couple hibernation mode.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,650
Sadly,
this left uncle barney   out in the cold.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,600
Okay. All-night rave,
abandoned tire factory  in newark.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,170
We're on the list.
Who's in?

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,240
- Nope.
- No.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,320
Private jet.
Teeterboro airport,skinny-skydiving.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,060
- Who's in?
- Nope.No,thanks.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,500
One beer.Bar,
downstairs,15 second walk.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,770
Who's in?

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,870
Lily went sleepy-bye.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,840
It got so bad,
barney   tried to be his own wingman.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,360
Hi.
Have you met me?

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,900
A@   finally,
he decided   to bring in reinforcements.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,430
No.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,980
Yes.
And do you know why?

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,580
Hang on to your bedsores,
grandparents from willy wonka,

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,820
because guess who's  on his way up  
to this apartment right now?

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,170
My...

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,830
wait for it...

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,370
brother,
james.React.

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,610
Hey!

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,810
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,040
He's the "awesome-est," most best "looking-est,
"  greatest guy ever.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,110
He's exactly like barney.

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,720
That's what I just said.

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,090
Well,barney and his brother  aren't exactly alike.

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,340
- James is gay.
- Really?

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,130
I neve  r in amillion years  
would I picture you  with a gay brother,

32
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,250
that's awesome.

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,730
Yeah.
I just wanted you  to have a heads up,

34
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,080
so you don't  act all surprised  
when he gets here.

35
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,070
Here he is.

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,350
What up,
new york.

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,850
Thanks for the heads up.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,350
What did it never come up  that barney has a  gay,
black brother?

42
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,290
Is he black?

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,110
I guess I'm the kind  of person 
that focuses  on who people are

44
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,390
on the inside  rather than the
 color  of their skin.

45
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,830
I'm kidding,
I just  wanted to see your face.

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,550
Yeah,so now the  wedding's back on.

47
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,260
Anyway,james,
how have you been?

48
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,410
Awesome,as per "yoozh.
"  I just went  skinny-skydiving.

49
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,940
Legendary.
And my laser tag team,

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,440
just made it to  regional finals.
"Legendarier.

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,330
"  And by now you've  noticed the suit--

52
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,530
go 'head,
touch it.

53
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,160
Handcrafted  by pietro dellacamera,

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,010
milan's famous  101-year-old tailor

55
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,280
who upon completing  the very last 
stitch  in this suit  dropped dead,

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,280
which is ironic  because that is
 how  gorgeous I look  in it.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,660
C'mon.

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,070
gimme five.

59
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,630
- Is "gimme five" back?
- Oh,yeah.

60
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,510
I put it in my  blog this morning.

61
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,100
Guys,
"gimme five"  is back!

62
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,410
Oh,james,
this is  my girlfriend,robin.

63
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,510
- Hey.It's so nice to meet you.
- You,too.

64
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,390
So,I have to ask,
there's a story here.

65
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,750
Please.

66
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,480
Be the truth is,
barney and james   got a lot of...

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,900
different explanations   
from their mom over the years.

68
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,970
Well,boys,
you  look different  because 
when I was  pregnant with you,

69
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,220
I only ate  vanilla ice cream.

70
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,370
And when I was  pregnant with you,
can you guess what kind  of ice cream I ate?

71
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,160
Coffee?

72
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,800
No,james,
I ate chocolate  ice cream.

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,250
But I did drink  tons of coffee  
when I was pregnant  with both of you.

74
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,800
Can't smoke  without my coffee.

75
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,070
I don't know,boys,
I guess  it's just one of those things.

76
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,950
Stop asking me!
You know what  you two are?

77
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,020
You're little racists!

78
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,830
So what are you guys  gonna do tonight?

79
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,340
I'll tell you  what james is gonna do.

80
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,360
He's gonna do the job  
you've been neglecting.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,140
And,as always,
he'll do it  a lot better 
 than you ever did.

82
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,950
Ted...
james is my wingman now.

83
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,940
Okay.

84
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,790
Last time james  was in town,
barney got slapped once,

85
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,520
lucky twice,
and...

86
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,270
whose penthouse hot tub  
did you end up in?

87
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,690
Ah,public figure,
confidentiality agreement.

88
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,680
But I will say this:  
Way more back hair than any guy

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,400
who can afford laser hair  
removal should have.

90
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,840
And then there was the time  
they scored the  brother/sister combo.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,470
It was everything  we ever dreamed  
of when watching   donnie and marie.

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,400
She was a little bit country.

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,980
He was a little bit  way into black guys.

94
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,330
Yeah,barney and james together   
was a lethal combination.

95
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,050
Since there was never   
any crossover in targets,

96
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,140
james was always there   
for barney with the assist.

97
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,650
Whoa.
Your scarf...

98
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,570
it is fierce!

99
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,100
Thanks.
H & M.

100
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,910
What?I would never know,'cause it is so hot  
that my eyes are melting.

101
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,070
Oh,I can't see.

102
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,440
Hey!You know,speaking of things  
that would look good  wrapped around you,

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,820
have you met my straight  brother,
barney?

104
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,160
Oh,he is fab--
don't you go nowhere--

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,070
"ulous.
" Okay?

106
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,850
and barney always returned   the favor.

107
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,130
Help,I don't think  he's breathing.
Does anyone know  mouth-to-mouth?

108
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,360
Oh,my god,
I do!

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,180
Okay,great.
How  'bout you instead?

110
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,050
Oh,man,
I am so  excited that you're here!

111
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,800
It has been forever  since I have 
been around  anyone even remotely fun.

112
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,140
Uh,yes offense.

113
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,720
You guys are still going out  with us tonight,
right?

114
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,170
- No.Jammies.
- I don't think so.

115
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,430
Tonight?
It's after 9:00  and...

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,690
I have  warm soup belly.

117
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,510
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.
Guys...

118
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,930
you are young,attractive people here  
in the greatest city on earth.

119
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,340
There are boys and girls  in nobody cares,

120
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,930
wyoming,
wishing they could be here.

121
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,360
But instead,they are  in someone's basement  
drinking bad malt liquor,

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,020
debating  whether or not they're going  
to spend their saturday night

123
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,760
in the parking lot  of the feed store  
or in some other dude's  basement.

124
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,770
You owe it to them  to rise up and shimmy  
your lazy asses  into something hot,

125
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,930
and you go out there  
and you live their dream!

126
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,210
Can I get a "hell,
yeah"?

127
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,570
- Hell,
- yeah!

128
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,320
- Can I get a "hell,yeah"?
- Yll,yeah!

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,040
- Can I get a "woo-woo"?
- Woo-woo!

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,620
- Go do it for wyoming!
- yes!

131
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,100
Testify!

132
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,220
So that night,
barney got his wish.

133
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,170
We all went out.

134
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,970
Daddy's home!

135
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,920
Yeah.

136
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,800
All right,bro.
What do you like?

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,920
Guy in super  tight black t?

138
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,550
Super tight black guy?

139
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,260
Guy who looks like mr.    T?

140
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,250
yes,yes,and...
talk to me  after two martinis.

141
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,650
Let's focus on you,
my man.

142
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,530
I'm feeling lazy.

143
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,460
How 'bout girl with  the chocolatini?

144
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,080
Oh...boom,
back tattoo.

145
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,140
Hero and the pig?

146
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,660
Let's ride.
Fo' 'sho.

147
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,270
Damn baby,
nice tramp stamp!

148
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,290
Get off me,
you pig!

149
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,110
Hey!
Her body art  is not an invitation  to grope her,

150
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,140
it's an expression  of her inner self.

151
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,830
I'm sure,in many ways,
she is  the dolphin encircled  by flowers.

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,970
- What?
- What?

153
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,720
- What?
- What?

154
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,330
- Cool.
- ***************

155
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,350
Let me know if he  bothers you again.

156
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,890
Thanks.You should stay close...
just in case.

157
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,440
Sure.
If it'll make  you feel safer.

158
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm barney.

159
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Now,kids,when you're out   at a noisy,
crowded bar,

160
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,420
you can always tell   the difference   
between the singles

161
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,250
and the couples.

162
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,210
You just have to look   for the signs.

163
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,500
- Break.
- Boiling hot.

164
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,730
Singles stay on their feet   
for maneuverability.

165
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,090
- Hey!
- Hi,how are ya?

166
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,520
Have you met my brother?

167
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,680
Oh,hello.
Have a drink.

168
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,480
Nice to meet ya.

169
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,910
Couples,exhausted   by the sheer 
act of leaving   the house,

170
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,780
are obsessed   with finding   a place to sit down.

171
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,640
There are a lot of other indicators,
too.

172
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,690
From choice   of social lubricant...

173
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,360
To basic body language.

174
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,390
But the point is,

175
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,530
there are many ways to tell   
whether someone has   single stamina

176
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,970
r couples coma.

177
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,610
I wish I would've wo sneakers.

178
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,720
I just got finished running  from some fat,

179
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,820
hairy guy  who was periscoping  
out of his pleather pants.

180
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,950
Permission  to come aboard denied.

181
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,420
I miss my jammies.

182
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,700
I can't believe i  wore a bra for this.

183
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,760
Bras suck.
They're so  confining and unnatural.

184
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,800
Yeah,they're like  a boobie zoo.

185
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Well,why don't you  take it off 
then and let  those puppies breathe?

186
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,510
Oh,please go sweat  on someone else.

187
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,260
Poor guy.

188
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,080
Poor guy?
Poor my boobs.

189
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,460
Well,it takes a lot  of guts to approach  
a girl and you  just crushed him.

190
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,750
Oh,yeah,yeah.
He looks  all broken up inside.

191
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,380
Whatever,you guys have  no idea what 
it's like  to be on the  receiving end.

192
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,680
"Oh,poor me.

193
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,930
I'm a pretty girl

194
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,450
"and everybody everywhere  wants
to buy me  drinks and have  sex with me.

195
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,600
"Oh,poor me.
I get  to order yummy,

196
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,210
pink drinks  "with chunks of real 
fruit  that guys secretly like,

197
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,170
but can't order because  they'll be made fun of.

198
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,980
- "  Dude.
- They're delicious!

199
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,750
Excuse me.

200
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,240
Join me in a shot?

201
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,230
Oh,no thanks.
I've had enough.

202
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,190
He's too in shape,

203
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,540
we'd spend all night  talking 
about  his body fat content.

204
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,040
Now,if you'll excuse me,

205
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,030
I'm gonna go have  a yummy,
pink drink  with fruit in it...

206
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,970
because I can.

207
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,710
You know,that was,like,the third hot 
guy  that james  blew off tonight.

208
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,130
Yeah,he's turning  down shots,
he's yawning,

209
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,040
he's  whining about his feet.

210
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,950
He's as bad as we are.
He is.

211
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,150
Wait,he's exactly  as bad as we are.
You guys don't think  that james is...

212
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,930
in a relationship?

213
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,600
No.There's no way.
He's barney's brother.

214
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Look at that.

215
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,660
He's texting!

216
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,500
Oh,my god!

217
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,130
He is in a couple.

218
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,070
This is gonna kill barney.

219
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,800
What's gonna kill me?

220
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,280
What's going on?

221
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,710
B-barney?

222
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,790
Have you noticed  anything...
different about james?

223
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,660
No.I mean,he's glowing from his  peel,
if that's what you mean.

224
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,220
We have reason  to believe that james is,

225
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,620
uh,maybe hiding  something from you.

226
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,090
I-I know you're not gonna  like hearing this,
but...

227
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,990
barney...

228
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,270
your brother is...

229
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,470
Monogamous.

230
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,910
That's ridiculous!

231
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,340
Just because  he's a little sleepy,

232
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,810
and he hasn't had sex  with anyone  
in a bathroom stall...

233
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,790
He hasn't had sex with 
in a bathroom stall.

234
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,360
And,barney...

235
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,070
I hate to be the one  to tell you this,
but...

236
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,520
he's texting.

237
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,820
No,he...
no!

238
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,520
That...
is impossible.

239
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,280
Excuse...excuse...
ex...

240
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,660
- hey,bro.
- Don't change the subject.

241
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,550
- Let me see your phone.
- Why?

242
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,350
I just want to  see your phone.
Let me see  your phone.

243
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,230
No,it's just a phone.
It's just a phone!

244
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,730
And it's got internet access,
and it's got a camera on it,

245
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,840
and you can surf the web  and do the whole thing.
It's so amazing how far  technology has come.

246
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,110
What kind of phone  do you have?

247
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,870
I got...

248
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,410
who is this?

249
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,300
And the answer better be:  
"I don't remember his name.

250
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,290
"  That is tom.

251
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,890
And he's my fianc?

252
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,100
hi

253
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,120
I don't support this.

254
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,250
Gay marriage?

255
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,990
Not gay marriage--
marriage!

256
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,650
how can you do this?

257
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,490
We were raised in the same  house,
with the same values!

258
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,970
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.

259
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,300
Come on,
it's embarrassing.

260
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,520
Look,this felt unnatural  to me,
too,at first.

261
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,000
But I fell in love.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,550
And tom and I realized  you can't fight love.

263
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,260
Oh,god.
Is that what  you two do together?

264
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,150
You sit around the house  and talk about love?
I think...

265
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,850
I'm gonna be sick.

266
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,160
Okay,okay,look,I need you 
to wrap your head  around this,
okay?

267
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,210
Because it is happening.

268
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,010
And I want you  to be my best man.

269
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,620
What?
No way.

270
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,510
Well,I'm sorry  you feel that way.

271
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,090
I hope you  change your mind.

272
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,360
Two beers,
one shot.

273
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,830
Oh,it's a freaking epidemic.

274
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,380
oh,sweetie!
Did you make that for me?

275
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,800
Yes.

276
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,020
Clam bake.Staten island.
Who's in?

277
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,520
Okay,I didn't   havehigh hopes for that one.

278
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,560
Okay,here's my thing.

279
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,210
If gay guys  start getting married,

280
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,540
then suddenly the whole world's  
gonna be doing it.

281
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,330
That's how it works.

282
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,890
They start something,
then six months later,everyone follows.

283
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,250
Like now everyone  gets manicures.

284
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,840
I don't get manicures.

285
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,900
Okay,then like how...
like getting your chest waxed.

286
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,600
:  You get your chest waxed?

287
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,480
You know what I mean!

288
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,230
Gay marriage is going to cause  single life,
as we know it,to die out.

289
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,600
Think of how the american family  
will be strengthened.

290
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,440
Barney,
I'm sorry you're upset,

291
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,340
but you got to suck it up 
 and be a man about this.

292
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,780
No.
It's always been  me and him together,

293
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,290
being awesome,

294
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,070
while the rest  of you walked two-by-two  
onto your ark  of sexless boredom.

295
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,010
Just because  james is getting married 
 doesn't mean things  are going to change.

296
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,880
Yeah.

297
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,350
Like things haven't changed  with you people.

298
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,560
Look,my sister married  a guy I didn't like.

299
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,180
Sandals and socks--
come on,buddy.

300
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,300
But I took her out,
we celebrated.

301
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,040
It was the right  thing to do.
You got to support him.

302
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,330
You're right,ted.

303
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,690
This is a cause for celebration.

304
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,480
We need to take him out  
and celebrate the commitment

305
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,800
he and tom are about to make.

306
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,700
yeah.This is where we're  celebrating the 
commitment  that tom and i  are about to make?

307
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,240
What?
Yeah!

308
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,240
See,
that cage represents  your commitment.

309
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,270
oh,my god.
Freedom has never tasted  so delicious.

310
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,350
Hey.
You work out?

311
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,920
I do.
And thank you  for noticing.

312
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,080
You're obviously  in very good shape yourself.

313
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,130
Well,I try.
So you want  to dance?

314
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,210
You know what?I'm very flattered,
and,objectively,

315
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,180
you're a very  attractive man,
but this is actually  my fiancéE.

316
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,800
I'm sorry.
You know,I saw  your drink and I...

317
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,580
no,no,this isn't my drink.
This is hers.

318
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,930
No,it isn'T.

319
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,620
Whatever.
How 'bout you?

320
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,360
Oh,I'm straight,
too.

321
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,270
But I thank you  for your time,

322
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,760
and I appreciate  your interest in my body.

323
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,460
U@ryou see that?
Being hit on doesn't  have to be terrible.

324
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,390
I feel flattered,
and everyone  left with their dignity.

325
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,990
hey,I really  like your sweater.

326
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,770
You actually do,don't you?

327
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
You're notchecking[
my boobs or anything.

328
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,100
My name's gay ken,
what do you think?

329
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,750
I love this place!
Let's dance!

330
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,580
And not be groped!

331
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,980
Whoo! Thank you.

332
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,110
Damn.

333
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,640
Thank you!

334
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,570
- We're hot.
- Totally.

335
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,840
and then tom says
to the dealer

336
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,700
that the handmade georgian clock
has a chip on the corner.

337
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,740
Blam,we get that puppy half price.

338
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,080
What up?!
Bam!

339
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,840
sounds like you really rocked
that arts and crafts fair.

340
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,630
Oh,yeah,oh,yeah.
Hey,oh,my god.

341
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,130
This is so liberating,being
able to talk about this to you.

342
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,010
I cannot wait
for you to meet tom.

343
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,530
And I cannot wait for you
to meet my good friend...

344
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,390
this guy.

345
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,910
Excuse me,do you know anyone
who would like to buy my incredibly muscular,fun,

346
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,550
large-handed brother a drink?

347
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,290
Eh,eh,eh,let's focus
on you,barnaby.

348
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,320
Okay.

349
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,530
all right.

350
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,430
I spy a group of women who have
let their defenses down

351
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,250
because they are
in a gay club.

352
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,140
You see that chick
right there?

353
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,240
She looks like she'd fall for
sports agent and football player.

354
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,720
Okay,I'm in.
Which one am I?

355
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,120
please.

356
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,720
He's very shy,
loves tennis and brazil,

357
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,670
and drops his pants
after three dirty martinis.

358
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,440
Now go,man,go!

359
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,690
I just never thought I'd
see barney so vulnerable.

360
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,610
Well,I guess no one wants to feel like
they're going through the world alone.

361
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,350
Look at me,in a yummy sandwich!

362
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,980
Okay,we're actually right in the middle
of something right now,so...

363
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,590
ooh,I know what I want to be
in the middle of. Thoughts?

364
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,820
God,can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,

365
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,310
enjoy some techno and good conversation
without being bothered?

366
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,230
How's it going,guys?
Still enjoying the attentions of men?

367
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,730
That's like the eighth guy
who's hit on us in ten minutes.

368
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,820
It's like,hello,
my eyes are up here.

369
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,830
and it's never the hot ones.
It's always the losers. Bums me out!

370
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,710
Looks like the boys
learned their lesson.

371
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,350
Do you totally miss
being hit on?

372
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,420
Oh,totally.
Let's go find a sports bar.

373
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,610
James,james,since you like
arts and crafts,

374
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,910
look at what charles here made
with cherry stems.

375
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,250
He did it with
his tongue.

376
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,300
Yeah.

377
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,040
Barney.

378
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,230
So,charles,why don't you put your number
in my brother's phone,

379
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,500
and once he's in
a funner mood...

380
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,380
barney,barney,i
don't want his number.

381
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,310
I don't want anyone's
number,okay?

382
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,820
I'm getting married.

383
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,500
- Best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.

384
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,120
My number's in here.

385
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,830
I'm very discreet.

386
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,000
Okay,okay,
excuse me.

387
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,740
Barney,family talk.

388
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,770
Okay,dude,you have
got to stop this,okay?

389
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,700
I know that my getting married is threatening
to your way of life...

390
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,290
oh,so now it's
my way of life?

391
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,600
I thought it was
our way of life.

392
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,640
You've completely
turned your back on it.

393
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,400
Look at you,
not even suited up.

394
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,870
Do you remember why
we suit up,james?

395
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,060
To get laid.

396
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,980
To show people
that we are different

397
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,530
from the millions of t-shirt
and jeans lemmings out there.

398
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,130
The suit shows that we are a force
to be reckoned with,

399
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,610
a two-person army
that plays by its own rules.

400
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,160
But you've taken off the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,

401
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,710
and you've abandoned me.
Well,I'm not gonna let you do that.

402
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,230
It's not too late to back out
of this stupid marriage thing!

403
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,020
You don't have to do this,bro!

404
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,410
- Yes,I do.
- Why?!

405
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,780
Because tom and I are
gonna have a baby.

406
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,970
What? There's gonna be a baby?

407
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,760
Yes.
We're adopting.

408
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,430
Oh,my god.

409
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,960
I'm gonna be an uncle?

410
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,180
For the rest
of your life.

411
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,820
And that's how barney
became uncle barney.

412
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,750
A year later,at james's wedding,
barney could not  have been more proud.

413
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,540
To james and tom.

414
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,310
May you have a long
and happy life together.

415
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,470
And may I always have
the skin and libido of a much younger man.

416
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,090
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

417
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,390
Nice one.

418
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,420
Thanks. I decided to leave out
the hetero college phase.

419
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,040
No one wants to hear about that.

420
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,260
It was perfect.
You even made tom's dad cry.

421
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,170
Might have been doing that
because he's a republican.

422
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,610
whoa.
It's 9:00.

423
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,070
We should be getting back.
You guys want to split a cab?

424
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,060
Uh,no,I think I'm gonna
stay a little bit longer.

425
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,070
Yeah,me,too. I'm
not tired at all.

426
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,310
All right,well,it's getting late.
Got to get the wife home.

427
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,610
Oh,stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.

428
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,870
**************

429
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,260
Ugh,it's a freaking epidemic.

430
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,820
See ya.

431
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,580
- may I?
- Yeah.

432
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,400
hey,buddy.

433
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,700
Your parents are married.

434
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,710
Now,listen,you.

435
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,080
Just because you're being
raised by married people

436
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,300
doesn't mean you have to choose
that lifestyle. High-five.

437
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,960
Luckily,you got me.

438
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,340
In 20 and a half years,
you'll be 21,

439
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,640
and I will be...

440
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,960
well,I haven't decided
how old I'll be yet.

441
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,010
But we are gonna bro out,
uncle and nephew style.

442
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,130
Stick with me,kid.

443
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,190
I am gonna teach
you how to live.

444
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,860
Great suit,
by the way.

445
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,290
who is the cutest?

446
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,080
I don't get it.

447
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,620
Tom liked my breasts
in tenth grade.

448
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,090
Why doesn't he like them now?

449
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,330
Why?

450
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,470
Rosa,why always be attracted
to the unavailable ones?

451
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,380
Why not accept the fact that you're a 
beautiful woman who is worthy of love?

452
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,600
Are you brave enough
to hear that?

453
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,940
You...
