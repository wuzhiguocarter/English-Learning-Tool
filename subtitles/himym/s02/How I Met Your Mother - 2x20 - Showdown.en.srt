1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,587
...some weird stuff started happening.

2
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:06,450
Why does my stomach hurt?

3
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm sorry, baby.
I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.

4
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:12,640
Oh, baby, you know
we're lactose-intolerant.

5
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,277
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:17,171
Are you suggesting that
when one of you feels something,

7
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:21,429
- the other feels it, too?
- Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.

8
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:23,677
- No, we're not.
- Oh, really?

9
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:25,048
What about the other day?

10
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:28,580
- Oh, I need to get some eggs.
- Oh, I'll come with you.

11
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:40,471
Just because we like spending time
together doesn't mean we're codependent.

12
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:41,678
Really?

13
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:44,479
Then whatever happened to your plan
of spending the last two weeks

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,591
before your wedding sleeping apart?

15
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:51,301
Okay, we decided not
to do that because of...

16
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:52,631
Logistics.

17
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:54,681
- Wedding logistics.
- Frickin' logistics, man.

18
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,121
They mess everything up.

19
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:58,582
You didn't do it
because you couldn't do it.

20
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:00,363
- Sure we could.
- Then why don't you?

21
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,701
You can stay with me.

22
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,291
It would make our wedding
night more special.

23
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,561
- Okay, let's do it.
- Done.

24
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:13,560
- I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- I'll come with you.

25
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:18,251
No. I'll stay.

29
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,920
Okay, I know.
You know? I got to go.

30
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,281
Good-bye.

31
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,420
My mom's driving me cra....

32
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:42,163
God, you guys are covered in sauce.

33
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,641
We'll get to that.
Me first.

34
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:46,681
My mom is driving me crazy
about the wedding music.

35
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,883
The woman takes one cruise
to Jamaica, and suddenly, it's

36
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:52,412
"not a party without steel drums."

37
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,643
Doesn't everybody know
you're not supposed to stress out

38
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:56,550
a bride right before her wedding?!

39
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:59,540
Okay, sauce, go.

40
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:02,360
- Long story. I'll tell you later.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,170
It's a dirty story, isn't it?

42
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:07,673
You guys went out to dinner,
did it in the kitchen and got caught.

43
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:11,090
Scherbatsky reeks of
someone who likes to get caught.

44
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,902
Okay, now I have to wash up
for two reasons.

45
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,422
Oh, you didn't.
That's right.

46
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:23,232
So you and Lily really think
you can spend two weeks apart?

47
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:24,193
You know what, Barney?

48
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:27,141
Lily and I are a lot less chees
than you make us out to be.

49
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:30,442
Marshmallow, don't forget
to pack my night-night tape.

50
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,970
Night-night tape?

51
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:37,623
Did you make a tape of
you saying "night-night" to her?

52
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:40,740
- No.
- He doesn't say it. He sings it.

53
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:43,370
Oh, that is so sweet.

54
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:46,960
Why don't you kiss?
I love it when two chicks make out.

55
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:48,490
Damn it.

56
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:51,321
Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.

57
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,631
- What's on there?
- Ooh, lots of stuff.

58
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:57,200
Kitchen Aide Artisan Series
tilt-head stand mixer...

59
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,660
Retail price $319.99.
What else?

60
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:05,270
Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.

61
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:09,851
Ah, $549.99.
A little greedy, don't you think?

62
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,411
- Did you memorize our registry?
- No, I'm training.

63
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,742
- Training? For what?
- I'm glad you asked.

64
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:19,352
Ted, Robin, get in here!

65
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:24,003
You guys know how it's hard to be
friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?

66
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:27,132
Yes, it's hard to be friends with you.
Go on.

67
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,802
Well, this isn't going
to make it any easier.

68
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,440
I am going to be on...
The Price Is Right.

69
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,912
- No way!
- What?!

70
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,002
Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields
is going to call out my name,

71
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:43,203
- and I will come on down.
- Whoa, that is so awesome.

72
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:45,862
Barney, I didn't know you were
such a fan of The Price is Right.

73
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,583
Are you kidding?

74
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:52,521
T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably
entertaining hour of television,

75
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:56,043
it's a microcosm of
our entire economic system--

76
00:03:56,057 --> 00:04:01,072
a capitalist utopia, where consumers
are rewarded for their persistence,

77
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:04,813
market acumen and intrepid spirit.

78
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:08,802
I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right,

79
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:12,052
and I see the face of America.

80
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:14,940
And it is divine.

81
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,290
Plus, you know,
hot chicks on sports cars.

82
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:23,450
Then Lily headed out to Robin's
for her first night away from Marshall.

83
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:29,591
- I'm ready!
- Ta-da-da-da-da...

84
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:35,492
- Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.
- I know! I'm beautiful!

85
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:38,680
I'm a fairy princess!

86
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,031
I'm too skinny for my dress!

87
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:46,191
Meanwhile, I was testing out
my best man toast on Marshall.

88
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:47,542
Here goes.

89
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:51,803
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

90
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,362
Strong opening, right?
That's fantastic.

91
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,263
When Marshall graduates
this spring, he'll be a lawyer.

92
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:59,641
But did you know that
Marshall has a criminal record?

93
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:02,621
That's right, on a road trip
up to Cape Cod,

94
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,972
Marshall was pulled over for driving
by himself in a car pool lane.

95
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,010
Oh, crap.

96
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,030
Oh, crap.

97
00:05:11,786 --> 00:05:13,251
Are you crazy?

98
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:16,571
You cannot tell that story
at my wedding.

99
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:18,270
My entire family's gonna be there.

100
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:22,512
My little cousins, my mom, my grandma,
my grandpa the minister.

101
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:24,541
That grandpa died three years ago.

102
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,490
His favorite grandson
is getting married, Ted.

103
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:30,751
I think he can take a day off from
haunting the barn to make an appearance.

104
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,850
Whoo!

105
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:35,073
Whoo-whoo!

106
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:37,301
Whoo!

107
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,241
Whoo-hoo!

108
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:41,783
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

109
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:49,310
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

110
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:52,691
- So which one, "A" or "B"?
- What was that?

111
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:55,603
I have to decide how to run
to contestant's row when they say,

112
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,623
"Barney Stinson, come on down!"

113
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:00,311
Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was.
Can you do them again?

114
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,883
Yeah, of course.

115
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:09,131
Hey! Very funny.

116
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:13,122
Just for that, when I win all the prizes,
the only thing you guys are getting

117
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,681
is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.

118
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:20,533
It's $300 just to take the bust in?

119
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,593
Oh, please, you have to have
some sympathy for me.

120
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:27,263
I'm getting married next Saturday,
and I'm too skinny for my dress.

121
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:30,032
I lost all this weight
without even trying.

122
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:31,221
Hello?

123
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:35,580
- What happened?
- She called me a bitch and hung up.

124
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,953
Oh, I don't know what to do.
I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.

125
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:41,560
Pay the $300?
Lily, are you crazy?

126
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:44,693
This isn't a problem.
It's a license to eat.

127
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:49,100
Look, what have you always wanted to eat but
didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?

128
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:53,833
Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflé
with a raspberry brandy sauce

129
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:58,790
topped with caramelized bananas
and hazelnut gelato.

130
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,313
I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.

131
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,153
Done!

132
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:07,490
Okay, think you're gonna be
happy with my new toast.

133
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:08,941
There's nothing sexual.

134
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:12,433
It's, uh, it's just the story of an
important moment in your relationship.

135
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,481
I'm all ears.

136
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:16,262
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

137
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:17,853
- Nice.
- Right? That's great.

138
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,372
Back when we were all freshman

139
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:22,443
and Marshall and Lily were just a few
short weeks into their relationship...

140
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:27,392
It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not
gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted.

141
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,250
We were starving.

142
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:33,052
So I'd gone out to get us some
snacks, and when I got back...

143
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,210
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

144
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:44,561
I know it's soon to say it,
but I'm so glad you did.

145
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,328
Yeah.

146
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:53,489
So here's what you want to talk
about in front of my entire family:

147
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:57,141
drinking, having a girl in my room,
eating junk food.

148
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,501
Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would
be mad at you for eating junk food?

149
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:03,912
Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's
not important.

150
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:06,521
Also, so Lily's never heard
that story before.

151
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:09,712
How's she going to react when she finds out
the first time I said "I love you" to her,

152
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:12,561
I was actually saying it to you
and a bag of Funyuns?

153
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:15,510
But who cares? You did love her.
And you still do.

154
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:18,390
And you're totally over Funyuns,
so it's not weird.

155
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,361
- Hey, Lil.
- Hey.

156
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:24,942
Hey? That's it?

157
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:27,011
What are you talking about?

158
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:29,032
Well, you guys have been spending
the last few nights apart.

159
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:32,083
I figured there'd be a lot of giggling,
crying, jumping up and down,

160
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:34,052
and then whatever Lily would do.

161
00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:37,562
Now, one thing I remember about
the bar menu at McClaren's

162
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:41,232
is that there were no fewer than
11 different deep-fried appetizers.

163
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,220
That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.

164
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:48,021
Check it out.

165
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:51,603
Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will,

166
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:56,512
that this is the $1 space
on The Price Is Right wheel.

167
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,572
Ready?

168
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:07,970
Oh, wow, that was pretty close.

169
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,453
Close?

170
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:13,133
Close?! It's called The Price Is Right,
not The Price Is Close!

171
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,242
Oh, man, this is bad.

172
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:17,693
If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't
get into the Showcase Showdown,

173
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,720
everything's ruined!
It's all ruined!

174
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,622
What is ruined?
Why, why is this such a big deal?

175
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:27,630
Okay, guys... sit down,
I've got to tell you something.

176
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:33,433
The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right

177
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,750
is because I've decided that it's time
for me to meet my real father.

178
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,801
- Your father?
- That's right.

179
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:46,351
My father... is Bob Barker.

180
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:53,040
- Your dad... is Bob Barker?
- That's right.

181
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,620
The host of The Price Is Right,
Bob Barker?

182
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,590
That's Pops.

183
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:59,031
- Barney?
- Yes, Robin?

184
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,992
Why in the world do you think
Bob Barker is your father?

185
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:06,213
Uh, because my mother told me
he was, that's why.

186
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,673
Mom, who's my dad?

187
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,573
All the other kids at school
know who their dad is.

188
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,772
- Who's mine?
- Oh, I don't know.

189
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:16,913
That guy.

190
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,891
Look, Dad, I got straight A's!

191
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:27,640
Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going
as for Halloween?

192
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,112
Want to play some catch, Pop?

193
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:37,162
So now I'm gonna go to L.A.,
be on the show,

194
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:38,731
win the Showcase Showdown,

195
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:42,381
make him proud of me,
and then tell him who I am.

196
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:47,181
You're gonna tell Bob Barker that
you're his son on national television?

197
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:50,011
Why is this so hard for you
people to believe?

198
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:52,251
Drop the popper!

199
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,801
Lily has to gain five pounds
in a week and a half,

200
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:57,080
and it is my job to help her get there.

201
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:59,383
This is the best wedding diet ever.

202
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:03,241
- I lost a pound.
- That is impossible.

203
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,332
You ate McDonald's
every meal for three days.

204
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:08,253
I knew that Super Size
Me guy was full of it.

205
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:11,533
Well, it must be the wedding stress.
We just got to up the intake.

206
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:14,772
Lily Aldrin, drop and give me
20 bites of fudge!

207
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:16,552
Okay?

208
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:19,441
Don't nibble at it.
Attack it!

209
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:21,872
Come on, Lily.
You can do better than that!

210
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:22,670
I can't.

211
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:25,312
Well, eat faster, before
your body figures out it's full.

212
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,512
I'm trying.
Oh, are you gonna cry?

213
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:31,291
You gonna cry?
Skinny little baby's gonna cry?

214
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,950
- Well, eat, damn it, eat!
- Okay!

215
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:42,742
Hey, so I think I figured out how to do
your toast in a completely appropriate way.

216
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:44,492
- Finally.
- Yeah.

217
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,303
Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

218
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:49,361
- Still strong, right?
- Great, yeah.

219
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,432
I'd like to share with you all a story
about the momentous evening last fall

220
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,223
when Marshall and Lily got back together.

221
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:59,943
Afterward, we stayed up
till 10:00 at night,

222
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:04,760
- doing shots of chocolate milk.
- Man, I'm well nourished right now!

223
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:07,280
Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.

224
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:11,211
Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us
you don't need alcohol to have fun.

225
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:15,412
Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents
for teaching me good values.

226
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,983
Now, I wasn't supposed
to hear this next part,

227
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:21,210
but Marshall leaned over
to Lily and whispered.

228
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,622
You know what I'd like
to do to you right now?

229
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:26,643
I'd like to hold your hand.

230
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,700
I'd like to hold your hand so hard

231
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:33,103
that you're not able
to shake hands for a week.

232
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:38,281
Are you just going to talk about holding
my hand or are you going to hold it?

233
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:44,180
Then a little later, Robin caught them...

234
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:46,991
Oh, um... ...holding hands.

235
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:51,112
It was a lovely and responsible night.

236
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,891
To Marshall and Lily.

237
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,612
That's the worst toast
I've ever heard, dude.

238
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,560
- It's totally boring.
- Exactly.

239
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:02,820
It's impossible to write a good toast
with you censoring me, man.

240
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:03,870
I give up.

241
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:06,670
I'm just going to read that thing
about Jesus and the footprints.

242
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,791
I give up, too.
I don't care if my dress doesn't fit.

243
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:11,291
I can't eat anymore.

244
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,921
I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.

245
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:15,492
I know.

246
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,811
And so, Lily and I were
both about to give up,

247
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,332
but as you can all see,
Lily does look beautiful in that dress,

248
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,370
and here I am giving a toast.

249
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:30,260
You know, all this time, I'd been
wracking my brain trying to

250
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:33,930
pick out the perfect moment to capture
Lily and Marshall as a couple.

251
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:36,592
But then I realized the perfect
moment wasn't

252
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,743
some needle lost in the haystack
of their ten years together.

253
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:44,500
The perfect Lily and Marshall
moment happened two nights ago.

254
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:50,962
Marshall, what are you doing?

255
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,130
Going to the bathroom.

256
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:54,360
In the hall?

257
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:56,330
Sleepwalking?

258
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,801
You're wide awake.

259
00:13:58,177 --> 00:13:59,882
- Robbing us?
- Dude.

260
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:04,580
Turns out, all week long he'd been
sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd,

261
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:06,150
to meet Lily.

262
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:10,320
- God, I missed you.
- I can't sleep without you.

263
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:12,672
Hey, baby?

264
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:17,223
- Would you be the big spoon for a while?
- Sure, baby.

265
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:25,421
- How's the weight gaining going?
- Ugh, terribly.

266
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,391
I'm too stressed out without you around.

267
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,361
Well, I'm here now.

268
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:37,161
And so Lily and Marshall failed in
their experiment with apartness,

269
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:40,241
but they succeeded
in getting Lily into her dress.

270
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,972
You know, there really are a million things
I could tell you about Lily and Marshall,

271
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,430
but really, the only thing
you need to know is

272
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:51,271
that ten years into their relationship,

273
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:54,951
they still couldn't spend
a single night apart.

274
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,542
May they never have to again.

275
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:02,771
To Lily and Marshall.
To Lily and Marshall.

276
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:06,971
Now, kids, the story of Lily and
Marshall's wedding is a good one.

277
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:09,320
No matter how perfectly you plan your...

278
00:15:09,338 --> 00:15:11,282
You know, wait a second, guys.
I'll get to that.

279
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,433
First, I've got to tell you
what happened with Barney.

280
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:16,581
Rich, what is the name
of our next participant?

281
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:20,212
- Bob, it's Barney Stinson!
- Come on down!

282
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,703
You're the next contestant
on The Price Is Right.

283
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:24,211
Nooo. Oh, my God!

284
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:26,033
Working his way out.

285
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:28,692
High-five here, high-five there.

286
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,373
- A big old hug here.
- Oh, my God!

287
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:33,783
Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.

288
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:37,063
Welcome to contestant's row, Barney.
Nice suit.

289
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:41,283
- Thanks, Da... Bob.
- Here is the next item up for bid!

290
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:46,732
Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches
feature an 18k gold bezel and crown

291
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,931
and stainless steel bands.

292
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:51,563
And Barney, what do you bid on that?

293
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,373
Um... Wrong.

294
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,783
Wrong.

295
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:57,790
Wrong.

296
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:58,830
Wrong.

297
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:04,180
Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since
you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.

298
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,843
- $1,350 for Barney.
- So, was it $1,350?

299
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,212
I don't know.

300
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:11,723
- Was it?
- Oh, my God!

301
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:13,820
Happy wedding.

302
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:18,913
Barney, you won that camcorder
in just one second!

303
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:22,450
That is impressive.
I mean impressive.

304
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:23,662
Thank you, Bob.

305
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:27,883
Now, to win the computer,
you're going to have to bid again,

306
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:30,450
and again I will say higher or lower.

307
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:33,830
And let's show the audience
the price of the computer,

308
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:36,861
and audience, please,
do not try to help us.

309
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:40,091
And the clock will start
with your first bid.

310
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,653
- $1 billion.
- Lower.

311
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,400
So, I brought some photos
that I thought you might like to see.

312
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,890
- This is me on my first birthday.
- Yes, Barney.

313
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:49,740
- This is...
- What are you doing?

314
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:52,853
Uh, spending some quality
time with my dad.

315
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:56,590
That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving.

316
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:59,500
You have only about 16 seconds.
Keep bidding.

317
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,031
- No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.
- Keep bidding.

318
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:03,412
This is me at my graduation.
I know, the hair.

319
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,290
That, no, that's nice.
That's nice.

320
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:10,070
You have only five, four,
three, two, one...

321
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:11,830
- $999.
- Nine...

322
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,372
Barney, you got it exactly right!

323
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,813
- Happy wedding again!
- Oh, my...

324
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:22,941
I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel
is the only weak part of my game.

325
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,942
I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.

326
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,082
Did you just...

327
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:33,651
- I'm ready, Bob.
- Do it! Do it! Here we go!

328
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:36,503
He's looking for the dollar.

329
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,500
- It's going around, and around...
- Oh, no, you spun it too hard.

330
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:41,122
No, he didn't spin it hard enough.

331
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:42,900
Here it comes, Barney.

332
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:48,033
You got it!
You won...

333
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:55,471
But Barney...
Barney, you're not through.

334
00:17:55,786 --> 00:18:00,032
You've won $1,000.
You've won a place in the showcase.

335
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:03,410
You are doing splendidly so far.

336
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,733
Thank you, would you, would
you say you're proud of me?

337
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,260
Sure.

338
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:11,881
That was kind of a weird moment.

339
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:15,551
Very well, Barney, you have seen
the first showcase.

340
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:18,910
Do you want to bid on it
or do you want to pass it to Millie?

341
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:22,472
Please, no car and an above-ground spa?
Pass.

342
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:27,383
Millie, he has passed this showcase
to you. What do you bid on it?

343
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:33,533
- $17,640.
- $17,640.

344
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:37,761
Overbid!
Now, let's see Showcase #2.

345
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:41,252
Barney, your showcase
begins with a mystery.

346
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,921
Oh, I love this.

347
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,493
I can't believe how excited I am right now.

348
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,243
Barney, you have seen your showcase.
What do you bid on it?

349
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,000
Please, please.

350
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:54,861
Please.

351
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,482
Let me.

352
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:05,443
1-8-4-2-1.

353
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:09,111
I don't even know what we're going to do
with a dune buggy, but I want it!

354
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:15,013
And the actual retail price
of your showcase is...

355
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:21,170
- $14,628.
- $14,628. Millie, you are over.

356
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:22,432
Too bad.

357
00:19:22,456 --> 00:19:27,632
Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase.

358
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:37,693
And the actual retail price of Barney's
showcase is... $18,421 exactly right!

359
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:43,121
- You win both showcases, Barney.
- Oh, my God!

360
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:50,091
Bob Barker, reminding you,
help control the pet...

361
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,322
Before, before we wrap up the show, there's
just something I want to say to you.

362
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:01,242
Congratulations on 35 wonderful
years hosting The Price Is Right.

363
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:03,371
Well, thank you, Barney.

364
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:06,182
Thank you...
Have your pets spayed or neutered.

365
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:11,640
Why didn't you tell him?

366
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,463
Well, it's just...

367
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:18,251
If you lived your whole life
thinking one thing,

368
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:21,801
it would be pretty devastating
to find out that wasn't true.

369
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:26,470
I just don't think Bob
could have handled it.

370
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:30,700
- Bob. Yeah.
- Probably a good choice.

371
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:34,650
Anyway, on the bright side.

372
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:37,072
Happy wedding again!

373
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,633
And that's the story of how
Uncle Barney gave

374
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:42,331
Lily and Marshall a dune buggy
for their wedding.

375
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:51,573
Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks,

376
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:54,541
I would sing you your night-night song.

377
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,162
Night-night, Lily

378
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:03,423
Night-night, Lily

379
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:09,291
It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly,
little Lily Time to rest your little head

380
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:12,000
Sha-la-la-la-la

381
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,960
Sha-la-la-la-la

382
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:18,593
- Come on, Ted.
- No, it's weird.

383
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:20,003
You promised.

384
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,563
Sha-la-la-la-la

385
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,393
Sha-la-la-la-la

386
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,600
Sha-la-la-la-la

387
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:34,493
