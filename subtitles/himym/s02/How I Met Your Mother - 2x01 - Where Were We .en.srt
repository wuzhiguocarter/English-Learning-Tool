1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,133
TED:
Okay where were we?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,501
It was June of 2006,

3
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,334
and life had just taken
an unexpected turn.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,968
Dad, can't you
just skip ahead

5
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:09,501
to the part
where you meet Mom?

6
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,634
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year.

7
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,267
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.

8
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:15,801
It's all part of the story.

9
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,133
Could I go to
the bathroom?

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,567
No.

11
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:22,801
The summer of 2006
was both wonderful and awful.

12
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,467
<i>For me, it started out great.</i>

13
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,100
<i>In fact, day one was amazing.</i>

14
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,234
<i>I'd finally gotten together</i>
<i>with Robin.</i>

15
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:32,701
<i>But while I'd been off having</i>
<i>one of the best nights</i>

16
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,968
<i>of my life, your uncle Marshall</i>

17
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:38,000
<i>had been having one</i>
<i>of the worst nights of his.</i>

18
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,767
* Crying in the street... *

19
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:41,801
MARSHALL:
<i>So that's it?</i>

20
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,801
We're breaking up?

21
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:45,601
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...

22
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,133
I just need to go

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,100
to San Francisco and do this art
program and-and figure out

24
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,267
who I am outside of us.

25
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:53,934
And the only way

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,701
that I can do that is if...
if we don't talk for a while.

27
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,701
For a while.

28
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,100
Try never, okay?

29
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:05,834
You walk out that door,
and we're done.

30
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:08,367
You're never going to hear
my voice again.

31
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,834
I should call her.
No, No.

32
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,834
Ted it is--
If you call her

33
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:13,634
when she asked you not to
you're just going to look weak

34
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,067
and you're going to regret it.

35
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:17,367
Now, listen, whenever
you feel like calling her,

36
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:18,934
you come find me first.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,234
And I will punch
you in the face.

38
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,601
You're a good friend, Ted.

39
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,767
(knock at door)

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,267
Hey.

41
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:28,701
So, did you hear the big news?

42
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,901
You mean how Lily and Marshall
broke up,

43
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,968
and Lily's gone
and nothing else

44
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,501
even remotely important happened
last night,

45
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:35,634
yeah, I think he knows.

46
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,400
Oh, my God.

47
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,801
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--

48
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:40,868
What happened?

49
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,801
Well, she left.

50
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,868
And I don't even know
if she's coming back.

51
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,367
I didn't get your message
until I woke up.

52
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:49,267
Bro, I am
so sorry.

53
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:50,300
Thanks.

54
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,734
I know
it must be tough,

55
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,234
but are you ready
to hear something

56
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,868
that will not only
make you feel better,

57
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,634
but will actively
excite you?

58
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,300
Sure.

59
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:02,734
For the first time, <i>ever,</i>
the three of us are single

60
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:04,234
at the same time.

61
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,968
I've dreamed
about this day, boys,

62
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,267
and it's going to be

63
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,667
legendary.

64
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:12,767
Together, we will own this city.

65
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:16,767
Anytime a girl wants to get back
at her ex-boyfriends,

66
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:18,701
we'll be there.

67
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:22,501
Anytime a girl wants to solve
her father issues

68
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:27,400
through promiscuity and binge
drinking, we will be there.

69
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,367
Anytime a bachelorette party
drives through the city

70
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:32,834
in a limo, sticking their
heads out the sunroof shouting,

71
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:34,467
(mimicking female voice):
"What's up, New York?"

72
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:37,968
we will be what is up New York.

73
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:41,467
Gentlemen, we are
about to embark on...

74
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:48,100
Aw, man, you guys
did it, didn't you?

75
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,940
<i>One thing I learned that summer</i>

76
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,419
<i>is that when love</i>
<i>is beginning...</i>

77
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:09,853
(moans)

78
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,519
<i>...and love is ending,</i>

79
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:14,185
<i>the first 30 days</i>
<i>are remarkably similar.</i>

80
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:18,185
<i>For one thing, you spend</i>
<i>most of your time in bed.</i>

81
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,452
(moans)

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,385
(groans)

83
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,686
<i>Your friends can't stand</i>
<i>to listen to you.</i>

84
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:25,752
He's so ticklish.

85
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,085
It was a really beautiful song.

86
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:35,385
So... stupid, man.
(mimicking choking)

87
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:37,886
<i>And you never seem</i>
<i>to wear pants.</i>

88
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,752
(sighs)

89
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:43,919
Hey, Marshall.

90
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:45,752
Hey, Ted.

91
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,085
You hungry?
What's the point?

92
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:49,152
I could eat some food.

93
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,152
It's just going to leave me.

94
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:54,085
Well, at least in that scenario
you get to do the dumping.

95
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,352
Come on, it's Sunday.

96
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,486
It's pancakes day.

97
00:03:57,552 --> 00:04:00,619
Lily always made the pancakes.

98
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,486
God, I loved her pancakes.

99
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,152
So soft.

100
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,919
So warm.

101
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:08,419
So perfectly shaped.

102
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:10,319
Are we still talking
about her pancakes?

103
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,953
Come on, you got to eat
something; what can I get you?

104
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,185
Beer.

105
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:16,786
No, that's what you had
for dinner.

106
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:18,519
Fine.

107
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:20,619
Then I'll just have leftovers.

108
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,419
BARNEY:
<i>So, he stays home</i>

109
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:25,853
all the time <i>not</i> getting laid?

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,219
No, see,

111
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:29,118
that's what you do when you have
a fianc\e.

112
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,652
He should be down here
celebrating.

113
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:32,352
He's free.

114
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,319
He got that redheaded tumor
removed.

115
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:38,452
You should write and illustrate
children's books.

116
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,886
You know what Marshall
needs to do.

117
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:42,018
He needs to stop being sad.

118
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:46,752
When I get sad, I stop being sad
and be awesome instead.

119
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,419
True story.

120
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,018
It's only been a month.

121
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:52,886
He just needs to go
at his own pace.

122
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:55,085
Anyway, Lily's the one
who caused this whole mess.

123
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:56,652
Hey, cut her
some slack.

124
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:57,985
She's our friend, too.

125
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,652
She's just trying to
figure out who she is.

126
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:00,919
Figure out who she is?

127
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:02,819
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.

128
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,819
She's selfish.

129
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,886
She's immature.

130
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:06,219
She's...

131
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:07,319
What?

132
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:10,285
God, your eyes
are so blue.

133
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,419
Aw, Teddy Bear.

134
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:17,219
(mimics sword unsheathing)
Oh that's a...

135
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:20,586
(groans)

136
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:23,252
(coughs)

137
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,919
<i>Yeah, it was hard to feel</i>
<i>too bad.</i>

138
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,686
<i>I was dating the woman</i>
<i>of my dreams,</i>

139
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,252
<i>and things were going great.</i>

140
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,652
<i>Well, for the most part.</i>

141
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:34,619
So, I found her shampoo.

142
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:36,619
MARSHALL:
I guess she left it here.

143
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,452
It smells like her.

144
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:44,886
Like lavender and seashells
and hope.

145
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,052
Somehow,

146
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:51,352
erotic and comforting
all at the same time.

147
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,652
That's my shampoo.

148
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,185
Oh, sorry.

149
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:59,352
Mmm, I thought
he'd never go to sleep.

150
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,985
(moans)

151
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:02,185
Uh-oh.

152
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:03,786
Already?

153
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:07,118
He's calling her.

154
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:09,319
I don't hear any--
He's calling her.

155
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,719
No.
(screams)

156
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:14,519
MARSHALL:
Okay, you're right,
I won't call her.

157
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:17,085
I will not call her.

158
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:19,018
Well, I called her.

159
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,519
And get this,

160
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:22,752
she changed her number.

161
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,185
What, like I'm going
to stalk her,

162
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,886
or something?
Like she's <i>so</i> special.

163
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,985
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin
out there.

164
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:31,652
'Cause there are four others
in the San Francisco area alone,

165
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,586
and they all seem
a lot better than her

166
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:36,052
based on the brief conversations
I had with them.

167
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:38,219
Does he know
I'm in here?

168
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:39,452
Yeah, hey, Robin.

169
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,419
Anyways, one of the
Lily Aldrins said...

170
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,552
This has to stop.

171
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,686
Ted, we just started dating.

172
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,319
We agreed we don't want
to move too fast,

173
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,085
and yet somehow,
we have a baby.

174
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:49,285
He can't feed
himself.

175
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:52,452
He cries a lot,
he keeps us up all night.

176
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,686
Have you tried breast-feeding?

177
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:55,219
Nailed it!

178
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,819
Look, they were
together nine years.

179
00:06:57,886 --> 00:06:59,586
It's only been a
month and a half.

180
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,586
He just needs to
go at his own pace.

181
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,886
He slept on our floor
last night, Ted.

182
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:05,619
He watched a
scary movie.

183
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,819
It is time
for some tough love.

184
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,686
We need to get him
out of that apartment.

185
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,152
He needs fresh air.

186
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,452
He needs sunshine.

187
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,085
Mmm, sunshine.

188
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:18,819
ANNOUNCER (over speaker):
Please welcome to the stage,
Sunshine.

189
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,486
All right, I really don't think
this is going to help.

190
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:28,152
Do you know why you're
not over Lily yet?

191
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:30,352
It's 'cause you can
still picture her naked.

192
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,786
You can't get over a woman
until you can no longer

193
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,052
picture her boobs;
it's a scientific fact.

194
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:38,519
The average male brain can
only store a finite number

195
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:41,452
of boob images
or "b-pegs".

196
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,819
And your hard drive's filled
to capacity with Lily's.

197
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,919
There are a lot of them.

198
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,686
Well, they won't go away
until you overwrite them

199
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,419
with images of
other women's boobs.

200
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:52,819
Now, this
journey may take

201
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:55,118
as many as a
million boobs,

202
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:57,519
so we begin here
tonight, my friend.

203
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:59,052
Two at a time.

204
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:02,052
Those count as four.

205
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,886
Yeah.

206
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,219
This is fun right?

207
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,919
We're outside, it's
a beautiful day.

208
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:11,786
The Indians are winning.

209
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,352
I got to admit,

210
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:14,686
it is really nice
to be outside.

211
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:16,118
ANNOUNCER (over speaker):
Yankee fans,

212
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:17,586
please turn your attention
to the Diamond Vision

213
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:20,319
for a special
seventh-inning-stretch surprise.

214
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:22,419
Oh, no.

215
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:24,118
(crowd sighing)

216
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:27,652
(applause and cheering)

217
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:31,886
It's all a big lie!

218
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:33,552
She's just going
to break your heart.

219
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:35,985
(crowd booing)

220
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:39,352
You can drag me out of here,
but she has no soul!

221
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,985
We've tried everything--
baseball, strippers.

222
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:43,985
The guy still won't eat
a damn pancake.

223
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:45,953
I think he's beyond repair.

224
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:47,686
See, this is the problem
with guys.

225
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:49,385
You don't know how to deal
with heartbreak.

226
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,752
Oh, and what's your
prescription, Dr. Estrogen?

227
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:54,185
Eat Haagen-Dazs
and watch <i>Love Actually,</i>

228
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,052
till your periods sync up.

229
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,752
(Ted, Barney laughing)

230
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:03,886
Yeah, that's the stuff.

231
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,319
Oh, my God.

232
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,285
How long have you
been doing this?

233
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:09,385
Well, my dad taught me
to me shoot when I was a kid.

234
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:12,285
Whenever I'm feeling lonely
or depressed, I come here,

235
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,018
and it reminds me that...

236
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,886
guns are fun.

237
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,419
(chuckles lightly)

238
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:22,486
Um, you know, Ted is
kind of against guns.

239
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:23,853
And that's why

240
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,352
Ted's never going
to find out about this.

241
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:28,219
Whoa, that sounded
kind of scary

242
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:29,586
with me holding a gun,
didn't it?

243
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,919
No, I-I just mean,

244
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:32,252
please don't tell Ted.

245
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:33,552
You want to try?

246
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:36,052
Only hell yeah.

247
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,219
Oh, yeah, yeah, this
is what I needed.

248
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:42,152
I felt so powerless
this whole time,

249
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:44,018
but this... (laughs)

250
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,419
this is power.

251
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,686
This is...
(gasps)

252
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,419
I should of mentioned
the recoil.

253
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:53,085
I got to hand it to you,
when he got home,

254
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,619
Marshall was smiling--
did you sleep with him?

255
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,519
'Cause I was actually,
like, three days away

256
00:09:57,586 --> 00:09:58,853
from suggesting that.

257
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,319
Sometimes, all you need
is to get in touch

258
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:01,452
with your feminine side.

259
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,586
(laughing)

260
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:06,752
Yeah, yeah!

261
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,219
Well, congratulations.

262
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:09,953
You're the first person
to cheer him up all summer.

263
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,652
You win.
Oh, what do I win?

264
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,886
I'll tell you what you win:

265
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:14,419
I'm taking you away
this weekend.

266
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:15,419
You are?
Mmm.

267
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:16,619
That's so nice.

268
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:17,886
Yeah, my aunt and uncle
have a beach house

269
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:19,752
out in Montauk, oh,
it's really romantic.

270
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,052
My uncle's had like
three affairs there.

271
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:23,919
Wow, must be a nice house,

272
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:25,719
I've seen pictures
of your uncle.

273
00:10:25,786 --> 00:10:28,152
This is going
to be so great.

274
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,018
We'll finally get
some time alone.

275
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,719
Are you sure Marshall's
going to be okay with this?

276
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:34,152
Yeah, absolutely.

277
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:36,052
Dude, I'm doing much better.
Oh.

278
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:37,786
In fact, take my car.

279
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:38,819
Really?
Yeah.

280
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:40,486
Hey, thanks...
and, hey,

281
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,619
if you need anything day
or night, just call me--

282
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,118
You know what,
please don't call me.

283
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,118
What? What's wrong?

284
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:49,486
It's, uh,
Lily's credit card bill.

285
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:50,819
She must have forgotten

286
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:51,953
to switch her address.

287
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,352
So?

288
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,252
So, I wonder what kind
of charges she's making

289
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:56,552
out there in San Francisco.
No.

290
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,486
No, no good can come
from looking at this.

291
00:10:58,552 --> 00:10:59,819
You've made too much
progress already.

292
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:02,118
I know but I just,
maybe the--
No!

293
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:04,385
You're going to
thank me for this.

294
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:09,786
You're a good friend, Ted.

295
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,385
August 5th,
one charge-- tickets.

296
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:17,352
To what? George Clinton
and the P-Funk All-Stars.

297
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,486
August 10th, one charge:
Tennis Emporium.

298
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:23,419
August 18th, two charges:

299
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:27,819
Mario's Bistro
and, get this, Pet Palace.

300
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,853
You guys see what
this means, right?

301
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,985
Wow, Mario's Bistro.

302
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:38,819
What a perfect place
to whore around.

303
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,619
Only the best
for my little Lily pad.

304
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,252
Oh, funk legend
George Clinton,

305
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,819
I am so glad you spotted
me at your concert

306
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:51,085
and dragged me onstage to dance
with you Courtney Cox-style.

307
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:53,319
And I'm so glad you agreed
to play tennis with me.

308
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:54,519
Aw.

309
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,018
You know, Marshall
tried to get me

310
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,886
to play tennis
for nine years,

311
00:11:57,953 --> 00:12:02,552
but I didn't do it, because
I never truly loved him.

312
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:04,018
I got you a gift.

313
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,385
Oh.

314
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:07,886
A ferret.

315
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:11,786
Oh, I'll buy it some food
next door at the Pet Palace.

316
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:14,252
Oh, I've always wanted one,

317
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,252
but Marshall had this
secret phobia of ferrets.

318
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,285
I bet that's something he made
you promise not to tell nobody.

319
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:22,586
(laughing):
It was.

320
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:23,953
Oh.

321
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:26,586
I love you, funk
legend George Clinton.

322
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,619
I love you, too, Lily.

323
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:30,652
That's right, Marshall,
she's all mine.

324
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,719
Now I'm gonna let her play
with my hair.

325
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,719
* Ow, we want the funk *

326
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:37,252
* Give up the funk... *

327
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:38,586
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

328
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,185
Yeah, why are you
afraid of ferrets?

329
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:41,719
They're adorable.

330
00:12:41,786 --> 00:12:44,452
Because, Robin, they're like
fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.

331
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,118
Plus, those charges are
from, like, a month ago.

332
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,352
Exactly.
For new charges,

333
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,819
you have to go
to her online account.

334
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:54,252
You can see credit card activity
from, like, two hours ago.

335
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:57,985
But, you know, don't.

336
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,786
Why do you talk?

337
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:02,819
Why do you talk?!

338
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,052
BARNEY:
He needs her password.

339
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,385
It's not like he
has her password.

340
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,619
Ooh, this is good,
he has her password.

341
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,719
There's a charge
from earlier today:

342
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:11,686
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.

343
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:13,953
I don't believe this.

344
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:16,018
Lily's back in New York.

345
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,144
I can't believe this.

346
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,268
Lily's in New York?

347
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,801
I-I guess I've been thinking

348
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:26,435
when she got back,
she'd call me.

349
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,368
That's really
the only reason

350
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:30,502
I've been able to hold it
together so far this summer.

351
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:32,968
This has been "holding
it together"?

352
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:35,001
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.

353
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,401
No.
Ted, give me the phone.

354
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:37,667
You're not calling her,
this changes nothing.

355
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,335
You, come here.

356
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:41,968
Look, while we're away
this weekend, can you keep

357
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,168
an eye on him, make sure
he doesn't call that hotel?

358
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:45,502
You want me to babysit him?

359
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:46,868
(laughs)
20 bucks.

360
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,335
An hour.

361
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,602
And money for pizza.

362
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,168
Uh, yeah, how about
you do it for free

363
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:53,201
or every time we hang out,
you have to watch this?

364
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:54,934
Come here.
Ooh.

365
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,034
My little blue-eyed
baby, baby lips.
Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...

366
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,135
Okay, I'll do it!

367
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:00,435
Stop being a couple.

368
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:03,368
Marshall.
Marshall, Marshall!

369
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,602
Ted, I know I shouldn't
do this, but I have to!
You call her

370
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,868
We were together for
nine years!
and everything
we've been working so hard for

371
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,535
is completely flushed
down the toi...

372
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:10,101
Hello, Lily Aldrin's
room, please.

373
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:12,834
Thank you.
Hang up now.

374
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,568
Ted, I can't hang up now.
Hang up now.

375
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,235
The missiles are in the air, and
I know that you don't approve.

376
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,602
Hang up.
Hello.

377
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:25,068
Uh, a guy answered.

378
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:27,834
There's-there's a guy
in her room.

379
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,701
I'm going down there.

380
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:31,767
BARNEY:
Dude, you can't do that.

381
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,502
I have to go down there,
and I have

382
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,535
to tell her I love her; I have
to beg her to take me back,

383
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,168
even if I have to
get down on my knees.

384
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:39,001
Marshall, you
can't do that.
Oh, really, why not?

385
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,701
TED:
<i>56 days.</i>

386
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,268
<i>That's how long it took me</i>
<i>to get right about here.</i>

387
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:45,034
Because you're pathetic!

388
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,767
I'm sorry, but right now,
you are not Marshall.

389
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,135
You are the miserable,

390
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,934
whining, shampoo-sniffing
ghost of Marshall,

391
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,468
and frankly, a guy like you

392
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:58,268
doesn't have a shot
in hell with a girl like Lily.

393
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,868
You know
who might have a shot

394
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,734
somewhere down the line?

395
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,734
Marshall.

396
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,268
The real Marshall.

397
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,801
But if you go down there right
now like this, you're going

398
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:08,834
to blow it for him, and he's
never going to forgive you.

399
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,168
Of course, whatever I say,

400
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:12,535
you're just going to do
the opposite,

401
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:13,568
so have a great weekend.

402
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:14,834
Good luck screwing up
your life.

403
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:16,468
Come on, Robin.

404
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:18,502
(clears throat)

405
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:22,602
Is it still okay if
we borrow the car?

406
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:27,235
Bold. Bold to go for the car.

407
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:31,667
What?

408
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:34,034
I didn't say a thing.

409
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,701
You think I was
too hard on him.

410
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,401
I didn't say a thing.
(scoffs)

411
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,535
I can't believe you're accusing
me of being too hard on him.

412
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:41,135
You're the one
who said "tough love."

413
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,734
Yeah, tough love, not
"hand the guy a noose."

414
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,634
Oh, but it's okay
to hand him a nine millimeter?

415
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:48,535
Yeah, he told me.

416
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,502
So you're a gun nut?

417
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:55,901
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.
Do you know
how many people

418
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,368
are killed each year
The Second Amendment

419
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:58,535
protects my right
to bear arms...
in accidents...

420
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,168
All right, all
right, all right.

421
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:02,268
I was too hard on him.

422
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,135
A little.

423
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:05,734
(laughs softly)

424
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:09,468
I'm going to call Barney,
see how they're doing.

425
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,168
(phone rings)
Go for Barney.

426
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:12,268
Oh, hey, where are you guys?

427
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:13,767
We're at a fundraiser,

428
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:16,034
helping young women raise money
for community college.

429
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,034
Strip club, nice.

430
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,901
Is Marshall okay?
(laughs)

431
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,368
Yeah, he's here
and he's great.

432
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:21,468
Uh, hang on.
Marshall?

433
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,201
Tell Ted that--

434
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:24,968
Uh-oh.

435
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,301
Already?

436
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:28,634
What? What uh-oh?

437
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:29,868
He's gone.

438
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:30,868
You lost him?

439
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,168
I can't believe this.

440
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:33,201
He's going to go down
to that hotel.

441
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:34,634
Crap, you're right.

442
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:35,834
Okay, okay, here's the plan,
here's the plan.

443
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:37,401
You go down to the hotel
and find him.

444
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:38,767
I'll stay here
and get a lap dance.

445
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:39,767
On three. One, two...

446
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:40,834
Barney!

447
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:48,468
Was there a hot tub
at your uncle's place?

448
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,934
A really nice one.

449
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:57,168
Hi, uh, could you tell me
what room Lily Aldrin's in?

450
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,401
Marshall.

451
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,368
(chuckling):
Hey.

452
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,734
What happened?

453
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:07,834
Well, I went
up to Lily's floor,

454
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,235
<i>and I had this little speech</i>
<i>in my head--</i>

455
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:12,235
<i>everything I've been wanting</i>
<i>to say to her all summer</i>

456
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:15,834
<i>about love, loyalty, respect.</i>

457
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,034
<i>I knocked on the door.</i>

458
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,301
So you knocked out
Lily's new boyfriend?

459
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:27,335
Yeah.

460
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:28,734
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.

461
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,602
What? Who-- who was it?

462
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,235
TED:
<i>His name was Joey Adalian,</i>
<i>although he went by a number</i>

463
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:36,101
<i>of aliases in his years</i>
<i>as an identity thief.</i>

464
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,734
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>earlier in the summer... </i>

465
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:41,502
LILY:
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

466
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,901
I-I could have sworn
I had some change.

467
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:45,801
I know, I know.

468
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:46,901
I'm sorry.

469
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:49,667
Oh, here we go.

470
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,235
No, that's-that's a button.

471
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:53,301
It was a button.

472
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,034
Do you, uh, take
credit cards?

473
00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:59,934
Yes, I do.

474
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:02,168
So Lily's not back in town,

475
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:03,201
and she doesn't
have a boyfriend?

476
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:04,535
Th-That's good news, right?

477
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:06,268
Yeah.

478
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,801
I don't know.

479
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,101
Those credit card charges

480
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,368
were the only remaining
connection I had to her.

481
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,901
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.

482
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:21,068
She was my whole life, man,
and now she's-she's gone.

483
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:28,401
You know, first day of
college, I showed up,

484
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:29,868
I was so freaked out,

485
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:34,767
and-and I got up to my room,
and there was my roommate,

486
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,068
lying on the bed with
his feet up on the wall.

487
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:39,602
Had headphones on,
big smile on his face

488
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,168
like he just didn't give a crap.

489
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:43,667
Happy.

490
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:45,568
Confident.
Not afraid of anything.

491
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:49,101
That guy was you.

492
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,801
You before you met Lily.

493
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,535
Ted?

494
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:55,568
Yeah?

495
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,568
I was high that day.

496
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,934
I was.

497
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,368
I was so high,
I thought you were the dean.

498
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,068
Wh-What I'm saying is

499
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,801
there's a version of
you without Lily,

500
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:10,468
and it's not this.

501
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:13,435
You can't let Lily
steal your identity

502
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:16,034
the way that guy stole hers.

503
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:19,701
Okay.

504
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:23,368
Okay, resolved.

505
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:26,168
Starting tomorrow, I'm
going to start being okay.

506
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:27,535
(chuckles)

507
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,801
Cheers.
Cheers.

508

509
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:37,268
<i>But he wasn't,</i>

510
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,568
<i>'cause that's not</i>
<i>how life works.</i>

511
00:19:39,634 --> 00:19:42,268
<i>The next day, he found one</i>
<i>of her socks or something,</i>

512
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:44,734
<i>and we were back to square one.</i>

513
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,602
<i>And then, one morning...</i>

514
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:52,001
Ted, I think
you should see this.

515
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,068
Oh, no, what now?

516
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,301
Marshall,
what are you doing?

517
00:19:58,368 --> 00:19:59,502
It's Sunday.

518
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:01,667
It's pancakes day.

519
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,504
<i>It took him 67 days</i>

520
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,850
<i>and one really disgusting</i>
<i>batch of pancakes...</i>

521
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,154
So good.

522
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:18,887
Mmm.
So good.

523
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:21,688
<i>...but Marshall had come back</i>
<i>from the dead.</i>

524
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:24,621
<i>Because while baseball,</i>
<i>strippers, and guns can help,</i>

525
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:28,221
<i>the only thing that can really</i>
<i>heal a broken heart is time.</i>

526
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,254
* I try to laugh about it *

527
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:35,788
