<i>One in 2009...</i>

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,459
<i>and one seven years earlier.</i>

4
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:11,821
<i>In all that time, my dating routine</i>

5
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:14,013
<i>remained more or less the same...</i>

6
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,543
<i>Until the fall of 2009,</i>

7
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,896
<i>when I finally had a date
that was different.</i>

8
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:25,400
<i>Because it was exactly the same.</i>

9
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:28,325
<i>I was on a blind date
with the same woman</i>

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,737
<i>I went on a blind date
with seven years earlier.</i>

11
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,142
It's nice to meet you.

12
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,578
<i>And she didn't remember it.
But then again...</i>

13
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,431
It's nice to meet you, too.

14
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:39,756
<i>Neither did I.</i>

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,431
Guess who just got four tickets

21
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,434
to the "Origins of Chewbacca"
<i>Star Wars</i> exhibit?

22
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,935
- Why?
- No, I said, "Guess who?".

23
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:03,200
I heard you.

24
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,388
Isn't it a little early
in our relationship

25
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:07,734
to do something that would end
our relationship?

26
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,223
What are you talking about? It can be
our first double date as couples!

27
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:12,867
And plus, it sounds awesome!

28
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:14,948
Is the original Chewbacca
going to be there?

29
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,868
Peter Mayhew, in the fur.

30
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:18,545
Who's with me?

31
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,134
Do you think they'll have
Wookiee to English dictionaries there?

32
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,626
Even just an everyday
phrase book would be helpful.

33
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:28,421
We're not going to
the "Origins of Chewbacca" exhibit.

34
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,633
It's in Houston this year.
Everyone knows that.

35
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:34,469
I just wanted to get
rid of the girls.

36
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,315
Where are you taking me, Barney?

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,307
<i>This wasn't the first time your
Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.</i>

38
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,290
Wait a second.

39
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,979
The "Origins of Chewbacca"
exhibit's in Montreal this year.

40
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,648
Everyone knows that.

41
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,483
Where are you taking me?

42
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:52,737
My guy in the DA's office scored us
front row seats to a lethal injection.

43
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:55,061
But wee still stopping
for chili dogs first.

44
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:56,336
Stop the cab.

45
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:58,533
Where are you taking me?

46
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,791
Barney, why are we here?

47
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,192
Marshall, now that
Robin and I are together,

48
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:10,338
I've learned a lot about relationships
by watching you and Lily.

49
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,757
- Thanks, man.
- You're a terrible couple.

50
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,008
Lily has taken all the man
out of you.

51
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,188
I used to think that's just
every relationship.

52
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:20,464
But what I've got with Robin proves
that you can have a girlfriend

53
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:23,939
and fully functioning male genitalia
all at the se time.

54
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:28,355
So, if Robin knew that you were here,
she would be completely fine with it?

55
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,681
Are you kidding?

56
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,741
She'd sprint down here with a
purse full of singles and a poncho

57
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,638
for the 10:30 Jell-O show.

58
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,963
BT-Dub, I called ahead, it's lime.

59
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,737
<i>Meanwhile, Jen and I were in my
favorite first date restaurant....</i>

60
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,078
<i>for the second time.</i>

61
00:02:43,203 --> 00:02:44,610
Jen, what do you do?

62
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:47,035
I'm between jobs...
banking crisis.

63
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,253
I'm between jobs...
Internet bubble burst.

64
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,761
Makes me realize I should go
into something more stable...

65
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,036
like banking.

66
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:58,052
- What about you?
- I'm an architect.

67
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,585
Hopefully, one day, I can use
my own humble brush on the

68
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,225
masterpiece that is
Manhattan's skyline.

69
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,184
I teach architecture.

70
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:09,451
Get 50% off the book store, so...

71
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,270
that's pretty sweet.

72
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,594
Married!

73
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,471
What is wrong with you?

74
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:21,028
You're just looking.
It's like fantasing about other women.

75
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:22,353
It's harmless.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,730
Wait.

77
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,261
Don't tell me you don't
fantasize about other women.

78
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:28,331
I do!

79
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:32,274
- It's just not that easy.
- False.

80
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,395
I once fantasized
about that silhouette chick

81
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,422
you see on a truck's mudflaps.

82
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,297
Took me less than a mile.

83
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,597
Not everyone is you, okay?

84
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:44,276
Even when I do start to have
a dirty thought like that...

85
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:46,267
<i>It seems so much like cheating</i>

86
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,934
<i>on Lily that I feel guilty</i>

87
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:50,904
<i>So first, I need to have
a different fantasy.</i>

88
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,614
Bad news.

89
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:02,156
Lily has a rare
and fatal hiccup disorder

90
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:04,077
that's apparently
medically legitimate.

91
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:06,287
What?! How could this be?!

92
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,262
Beats me, but it says it right here

93
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,625
on this doctor clipboard
that doctors have.

94
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,262
It's time, baby.

95
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,923
I will never love again.

96
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,186
No, Marshall, you must.

97
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:33,414
And after an appropriate
number of years,

98
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,571
you should find someone else.

99
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:39,314
Someone like that busty delivery girl
from than one time.

100
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:40,456
And...

101
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,882
plow her like a cornfield.

102
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:47,553
And so, Marshall...

103
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:49,913
to honor Lily, you must find

104
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:52,694
that busty delivery girl
from that one time

105
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,877
and plow her like a cornfield.

106
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,182
Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.

107
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,976
This once for you Lily.

108
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,528
Where do I sign?

109
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:25,277
And then...

110
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:27,785
watch out, because it is on!

111
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:32,206
At is the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

112
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,042
Dude, Lily gets you in real life

113
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,211
She has no business
in your fantasies.

114
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,714
It's all I know, okay?
I can't, I can't help.

115
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,632
I accept your invitation.

116
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:45,428
From this day forward, I will be
the wingman of your mind.

117
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:46,864
Now, focus

118
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:49,772
on the next dancer. Put Lily
completely out of your mind.

119
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,724
<i>Gentlemen,
say hello to J... Jasmine.</i>

120
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:05,655
Is it just me or does that
stripper look exactly like...?

121
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,159
Ted, we found a stripper
who looks exactly like Lily!

122
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,869
Yeah, I can't talk right now.

123
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,276
I'm speechless, too.

124
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:13,456
Everything's as perky
as we've always imagined!

125
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,832
Stop looking at her.

126
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,418
Look, I got to go. Take a picture.

127
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,544
I will.

128
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,934
But first, I'm going make Marshall
watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant

129
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:24,383
- between his wife's tatas.
- I'll kill you!

130
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:29,877
- Sorry about that.
- So, any thoughts on food?

131
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:34,852
Do you wanna share the oysters?

132
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:36,979
I would love to share the oysters.

133
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,185
Good. 'Cause if you didn't...

134
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,460
that would be mighty shellfish.

135
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:45,281
That's... bad.

136
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,114
That's why it's funny!

137
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,964
We've been on this date before.

138
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:59,793
We've been on this exact
blind date before.

139
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:02,923
In this exact same restaurant.

140
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:06,468
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't
think that blind date went too well.

141
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:07,904
Me neither.

142
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,079
I remember thinking
that you were a little snobby.

143
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,524
Wait, you...

144
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,225
You dress your cats up
in weird costumes.

145
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,061
They're not weird.
See, you're being snobby again.

146
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:22,692
Do you realize what this means?
Since our first date,

147
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,913
we've done a complete lap

148
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,131
of all the single
people in New York,

149
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:29,531
only to end up back here,
with each other.

150
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,618
We're going to die alone, aren't we?

151
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:35,956
Well, you've got your cats.

152
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,416
This is insane.

153
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,002
Wait, I got to ask.
Why did you think I was snobby?

154
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,791
We were sitting over there...

155
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:51,761
Main Lobster.
They spelled "Maine" without the "e."

156
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,891
Good to know we're not getting
the crappy understudy lobsters, right?

157
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,935
Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half
lobster will be played by...

158
00:07:59,105 --> 00:07:59,980
I get it.

159
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:04,983
Pointing out spelling errors in a menu
makes you seem kind of snooty.

160
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,944
I had no idea.

161
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:11,286
What about me?
Aside from the cats,

162
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:12,867
how did I come across?

163
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:15,061
That's right... the check.

164
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,996
The check came and, of course,
I was going to pay,

165
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:19,999
but you didn't do the check dance.

166
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,979
Guys want to wave the girl off and,
you know, look like a big shot.

167
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,650
I had no idea.

168
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,443
This is good. We're learning stuff.
You know what we should do?

169
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,057
We should retrace
the rest of that night

170
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:54,036
and figure out what else
we do wrong on first dates.

171
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:57,662
Cause let's be honest...
we are scaring people off, Jen.

172
00:08:58,058 --> 00:08:59,602
We really are.

173
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:01,539
I'm in.

174
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,610
- Great.
- Where'd we go next?

175
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,378
I think we went to Mac Laren's.

176
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,843
I didn't really talk about
my cats that much, did I?

177
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:18,570
And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams,
the jester of the group.

178
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,029
Tone down the kitty talk.

179
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,238
Check.

180
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:27,273
You will not believe
who we saw tonight.

181
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,608
We saw the third doppelganger!

182
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:32,897
<i>I should explain.</i>

183
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,970
<i>Over the years
we had spotted two strangers</i>

184
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,201
<i>who looked exactly like
members of our group.</i>

185
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,678
<i>Lesbian Robin.</i>

186
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:47,682
<i>And moustache Marshall.</i>

187
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:52,466
<i>By the folwing summer, we would find
the remaining two doppelgangers.</i>

188
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,940
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

189
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,415
Ladies... meet...

190
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,267
stripper Lily.

191
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:00,904
Yeah, I couldn't

192
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,643
get her face in it.
But she looks just like you.

193
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,478
So you went to a strip club?

194
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,981
Busted.

195
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,078
And there was a stripper
who looked exactly like me?

196
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,653
- Before you get married, let me...
- Awesome!

197
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,583
I bet the guys were going crazy.

198
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,754
I bet them wanted
to touch her so bad.

199
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,706
But all you can do is look,
unless you go into the back room,

200
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:22,769
but honey, you got to pay for that.

201
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,686
Strip club.

202
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:27,250
Marshall made me go.

203
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:32,788
So what did I do wrong next?
Let me have it. I'm here to learn.

204
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,699
I kept telling you I was cold,
but you didn't offer me your jacket.

205
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,890
It's a little brisk
out tonight, huh?

206
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,855
- Not really.
- Really?

207
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:45,044
I can't feel my fingers.

208
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,992
I'm pretty impervious
to stuff like that.

209
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:51,415
I couldn't admit I was cold.
I didn't want to seem like a wimp

210
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,448
compared to your
action hero ex-boyfriend

211
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:55,361
who you wouldn't stop talking about.

212
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,348
After a day of fighting fires,
Jim would love to come home

213
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,718
and unwind working on his 68 Camaro.

214
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:04,380
That or bare-knuckle boxing, which
he learned in the Marine Corps.

215
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,173
I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.

216
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,719
So no talking about the ex.

217
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:14,048
Not even about his
shockingly small wiener?

218
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:17,561
Why didn't you lead off with that?

219
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,265
Was there a shower on stage?
Sometimes there's a shower on stage.

220
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,213
I bet stripper me would
get in there with another girl

221
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:27,838
and just go bananas.

222
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:32,142
We got to have a bros' night at
a strip club and both of our ladies

223
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,515
- are totally cool with it.
- I'm not cool with it.

224
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,603
Because they understand
that it's healthy

225
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:39,138
- for us to do that from time to time.
- It's disgusting.

226
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:42,399
- Because it's harmless.
- Did one of your whores tell you that?

227
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:43,574
And, Lil...

228
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,598
Marshall shouldn't have to go
to so much trouble just to have

229
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,122
an innocent fantasy.

230
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,668
- Trouble? What trouble?
- It's, no, it's nothing.

231
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,773
Marshall, tell her.
We're all friends here.

232
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,098
No, we're not.

233
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,187
Sometimes I think about other women.
It happens, but

234
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,737
even when I do, I feel so guilty

235
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:08,644
that I have to imagine you...
passing away first,

236
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,415
because even in a fantasy world
I could never cheat on you. You're...

237
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,190
you're just my life, baby.
And I love you.

238
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:18,946
You kill me off?!

239
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,007
I mean, fantasize about
other girls all you want,

240
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,951
but could you maybe not murder me?!

241
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,420
Murder?! No! I, baby, no.
You develop a chronic illness!

242
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,624
I spare no expense for your care!
I even st up a foundation at your name.

243
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,949
We're, like, this close to a cure.

244
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:34,689
Remember?

245
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:39,252
I do remember. We went in here
for a drink with your friends.

246
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:40,346
Who I loved...

247
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:43,065
or hated, depending on whether
you're still friends with them.

248
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,139
- You loved them.
- They're family, Ted.

249
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,351
Let's go in and see
what they remember. And...

250
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,096
they are my best friends, so...

251
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:52,785
don't be surprised if they suddenly
"can't think"of anything I do wrong.

252
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,774
Did he juggle? Bad puns?

253
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,194
Expect a standing ovation
for picking up a $19 check?

254
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:01,346
Let's not forget the menu
typo gold mine.

255
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,232
Keep pannin' that river, buddy.

256
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:06,257
Well, it is a lot cheaper
than buying a condom.

257
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,203
Actually you know what it was?

258
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:11,832
I remember him coming across
as kind of a player.

259
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,128
We were all sitting over there...

260
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:21,926
And here's a picture of my cats
dressed up like Batman villains.

261
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:25,012
You got the Joker,
the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...

262
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,730
What about Cat Woman?

263
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,475
That would've been good.

264
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,119
Nice.

265
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,152
Wait... I remember that.
I was not checking out a girl.

266
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,351
Nice.

267
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:52,039
We were checking out
Moustache Marshall.

268
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,002
Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk.
I'm so sorry.

269
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,965
It's nice to know "past me"
wasn't a total jackass, huh?

270
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:03,717
"Present you" isn't so bad, either.

271
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,322
- Thank you very much.
- You got it.

272
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,443
I remember this.

273
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:17,863
And there's the Chrysler Building.

274
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,983
And the Empire State Building.

275
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:24,913
And at 12:00, a rotund couple
going at it against the glass.

276
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:28,367
That's kind of sweet.

277
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:31,663
Snack break.

278
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:33,912
Good for them.

279
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:37,444
Letting a guy eat pizza
off your back, that's love.

280
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:45,496
I know this wasn't the best
first date of all time, but...

281
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:47,772
I'm glad we stuck it out.

282
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:48,762
Me, too.

283
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,981
That was really great.
What... went wrong?

284
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:00,584
I remember now.

285
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:11,493
So would you maybe...
want to go out again?

286
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:14,621
I would. Will you call me?

287
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,831
Absolutely.

288
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:18,235
- Promise?
- Promise.

289
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:22,657
I have been so...

290
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:24,516
busy.

291
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,271
Good night, Ted.

292
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,020
Jen, I'm sorry. Look, I know I'm
seven years late with this call,

293
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:40,480
but I was an idiot back then.

294
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,065
You saw the goatee.

295
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:46,319
The truth is, I had a great time
tonight, and I'd love to see you again.

296
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:49,218
There are two kinds of guys.

297
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:51,545
The guys that you want
to call you, who don't,

298
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,563
and the guys you don't want
to call you, who always do.

299
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,372
And somehow, right now...
you're both.

300
00:16:01,036 --> 00:16:03,700
You should be able to fantasize
about another woman

301
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:07,025
without feeling guilty, or,
you know, killing me off.

302
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:10,828
I wish that I could, but I've been
doing this for so long, I'm...

303
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,096
all confused about death and sex.

304
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:16,055
It's gotten to the point where
every time I drive past a cemetery,

305
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,830
I'm sportin' a partial.

306
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,312
We got to fix this.

307
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,761
When Stripper Lily gets out here,

308
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:26,151
you have my permission
to fantasize about her.

309
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,654
And since she's basically me,
maybe you won't feel guilty.

310
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:33,241
Thanks, baby. I'm... so lucky
I have you. And stripper you.

311
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:36,984
Bring out Stripper Lily!

312
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,551
You know, I don't
come here that much.

313
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:45,491
Here's the usual and I'll send over

314
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:48,256
the other usual as soon
as she's done stretching.

315
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,509
Thank you, kindly stranger.

316
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,760
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

317
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:58,103
<i>I didn't see you come in. I'll load up
some AC/DC for you, buddy.</i>

318
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:02,312
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please
put your hands together for Jasmine.</i>

319
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:09,611
I am hot!

320
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,156
Crawl for it, stripper me.

321
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:15,742
It is awesome, baby,
can I get another hundred?

322
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,690
- That was a hundred?
- She crawls fast.

323
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:24,959
I wish I could go back and talk
some sense into 2002 Ted,

324
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:27,372
but that guy's a lost cause.

325
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:28,777
He's 24.

326
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,674
He thinks a little facial hair
makes him look like Johnny Depp.

327
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:35,385
He has no idea what a great girl
he's missing out on.

328
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,015
But I've learned a lot since then.
I've learned a lot tonight.

329
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:41,261
The only thing
that we've learned is that,

330
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:43,694
seven years ago,
it was mistake for us to go out.

331
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:46,106
And I guess it was a mistake
for us to go out tonight.

332
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,474
No, it wasn't.

333
00:17:47,939 --> 00:17:50,601
I had a great time tonight.
And seven years ago,

334
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:52,987
if you think about it,
we didn't miss by that much.

335
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:56,694
If a couple things had gone
a little bit differently...

336
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,910
who knows what would have happened?

337
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,581
You are the best.

338
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,919
You are the best. My girlfriend is
at a strip club with me

339
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,387
- and she couldn't care less.
- I do care.

340
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:54,306
We're dating now.
That changes things.

341
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:56,610
We have to have a serious talk
about this.

342
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,397
- Just the best.
- Girlfriend trouble?

343
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:02,188
I wish I could help,
but my unbelievably cool wife

344
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:05,300
just bought us a private dance
with her stripper body double.

345
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:06,675
If you need me,

346
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,815
I'll be getting grinded like
some pepper, in the Champagne room.

347
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:13,294
Just the best.

348
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:19,741
Now what?

349
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,868
I just remembered
why I didn't call you.

350
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:23,036
Why?

351
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,878
I can't believe I'm gonna
screw this up again, but...

352
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,084
I like finding typos in menus.

353
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,716
And I know my shellfish pun
is stupid but the truth is...

354
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,791
I'm not suddenly gonna stop
making stupid jokes.

355
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,000
Now that you mention it...

356
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:43,178
I'm never going to stop
talking about my cats.

357
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:45,174
They're funny and adorable

358
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,449
and totally worth having
to take six Benadryl a day.

359
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:51,851
Shouldn't we...

360
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:55,497
hold out for the person who
doesn't just tolerate our little quirks,

361
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:57,445
but actually kind of likes them?

362
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,754
Even if it means finding ourselves

363
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:03,367
on another blind date with each
other, seven years from now?

364
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:06,078
Dear God, I hope that don't happen.

365
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:13,795
Good luck out there, Jen.

366
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,131
You too, Ted.

367
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,802
You'll find your shellfish lady.

368
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:27,612
<i>And kids, when I told
your mother that shellfish joke,</i>

369
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:28,937
<i>she did laugh.</i>

370
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:31,872
<i>And I swear, it was only,
like, 30% pity.</i>

371
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,616
Looks like... Jasmine's having
a hard time getting out of those boots.

372
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:44,634
What did you say, buddy?

373
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,423
Who?

374
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:52,107
I am this Lily.

375
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,990
We married long time.

376
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,752
May I have monies for shopping?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
