00:00:00,392 --> 00:00:03,755
<i>In the fall of 2009, a new
couple had moved in upstairs.</i>

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,092
<i>We hadn't met them yet,
but we could hear them...</i>

3
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:07,367
<i>all the time.</i>

4
00:00:07,492 --> 00:00:10,667
<i>They were always... 
Let's just say they were always</i>

5
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,442
<i>"playing the bagpipes."</i>

6
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,568
Okay, this is ridiculous.

7
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,729
I can't believe those
two are still bagpiping.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,101
I know. It's been six hours.

9
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:26,984
Must be that tantric bagpipe
that Sting is into.

10
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,874
She keeps yelling out for him
to play the bagpipes harder,

11
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,206
but it sounds like he's
bagpiping her pretty hard.

12
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:35,743
There's a glass of water in my bedroom
that's vibrating like Jurassic Park.

13
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:39,246
You have neighbors!

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,964
Shut the bagpipes up!

17
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,176
<i>I decided to go to the bar
to get some peace and quiet.</i>

18
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,974
<i>That didn't work out so well.</i>

19
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:01,974
I hate to have to be
the one to tell you this.

20
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,855
Marshall and Lily
are getting a divorce.

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,212
- No, they're not.
- Just listen

22
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:09,610
to what I witnessed yesterday.

23
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:12,655
Baby, you mind washing that?

24
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,091
No problem.

25
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:17,487
I should go.

26
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,081
She makes him wash his dishes
right away, Ted.

27
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:25,501
I give 'em two,
maybe three weeks tops.

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,044
That's not a big deal.

29
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,089
And it's certainly not a big enough deal
for you to be holding my hands.

30
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,008
They're in big trouble.

31
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,520
I see what's going on.
You, my friend,

32
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,869
are suffering
from a little known condition...

33
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,788
"little known" because I just
made it up,

34
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:42,518
called "New Relationship Smugness".

35
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:45,271
You and Robin are
in the honeymoon phase.

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,957
Everything's perfect.

37
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:48,786
Every song on the radio's about you.

38
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:50,430
Every other couple sucks.

39
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,903
Enjoy it.
N.R.S. doesn't last forever.

40
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,573
It does when you're this awesome.

41
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:57,782
Check it out.
Robin and I have been keeping

42
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,659
a tally of how many beds
we've done it in.

43
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:01,620
We're up to 83-and-a-half.

44
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:02,663
A half?

45
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,495
19th century ottoman
in an antique shop.

46
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,129
- What's up?
- Tiger.

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,989
How ya holding up?
Do you need a hug?

48
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,968
You want to talk about yesterday?
Safe space.

49
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,653
He thinks Lily
asking you to wash your dishes

50
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,939
right away is a sign your
marriage is crumbling.

51
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:22,280
What? Why?

52
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,644
Lily likes a clean sink, so I do
the dishes;what's the big deal?

53
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:28,437
I'll tell you what the big deal is.

54
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,985
You know how I was always
the best at being single?

55
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:37,606
Now I am the best at relationships.

56
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,575
Even better than you and Lily.

57
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:43,291
Look at you.
Had a girlfriend for 5 minutes,

58
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,706
You think you can play
with the big boys... adorable. Son,

59
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,884
I've been in a relationship
since you had a ponytail

60
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,128
and were playing Dave Matthews
on your mama's Casio.

61
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,435
I'm a good boyfriend in my sleep.

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,204
I can rock a killer foot rub
with one hand

63
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:59,804
and brew a kick-ass pot of chamomile
in the other that would make you weep.

64
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,686
Hell, I've forgotten more
about microwaving

65
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:05,040
fat-free popcorn and watching
Sandra Bullock movies

66
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:08,332
than you'll ever know,
but thanks for your concern, rook.

67
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,607
- Let me ask you one question.
- Sure.

68
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:15,861
Do you mind if there is
a sink full of dirty dishes?

69
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:17,786
Not really.

70
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,199
Then it's Lily's problem, not yours.

71
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:23,953
But if I said that to her,
it would only lead to a fight, so...

72
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,539
You fight.
See, Robin and I never fight.

73
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,439
- Of course you do.
- No.

74
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:29,863
And here's the secret:

75
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:32,837
every time it looks like
we're about to get into a fight...

76
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:36,589
Why is there
a bag of panties labeled

77
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,218
"April 2008" in your closet?

78
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:55,442
So any time you think you might have
a fight, you just get up and leave?

79
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,265
100% effective.

80
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:00,614
Can't fight if you're not there.
That's what Gandhi taught us.

81
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,864
That's not true.

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,243
I can't believe that
Robin puts up with that.

83
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:07,496
Don't worry. She's got a great way
to avoid fights, too.

84
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:10,958
Are ties machine washable?

85
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:13,749
No, they most certainly
are not. Why?

86
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,131
What is in your hand?

87
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,925
My God, what's in your hand?!

88
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:29,463
Okay, so you walk away.
Robin gets naked.

89
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,612
Those are the two stupidest ways
to handle conflict I've ever heard.

90
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,273
The naked thing ain't bad.

91
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:38,569
- That felt kind of weird.
- Okay, call me crazy.

92
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:42,772
But when a problem comes up,
Lily and I actually talk about it.

93
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,269
There are so many great things to do
with the human mouth.

94
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:46,924
Why waste it on talking?

95
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:49,455
But if you insist,
here's what I would say

96
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,957
about the dishes
if I were Lily's husband.

97
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,169
Barney, you're home!

98
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,715
Dude!

99
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,051
- Get to the point!
- All right.

100
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,036
Thanks, doll.

101
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:09,975
Sweetie, are you going to wash that?

102
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,227
I'm glad you bring that up. No.

103
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:13,646
And here's why.

104
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,016
Lily, I know you don't
like a dirty sink.

105
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,029
But does that make it my job
to keep it clean?

106
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:25,275
I mean, if one day I look up
at the living room ceiling

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,354
and think, "Hey, I'd like a replica
of the Sistine Chapel up there."

108
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,424
Would it be your job to paint it?

109
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:31,872
No.
Of course not.

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,360
Exactly! So, baby,
by the same logic,

111
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:36,546
if you don't like looking
at a sink full of dishes,

112
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,379
shouldn't it be your job
to clean them?

113
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,102
Thanks for explaining that.
I get so confused.

114
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,427
That's because you're a woman.

115
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,016
- I don't even know why we're laughing!
- Of course you don't.

116
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:55,854
You're kidding me with this.

117
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:58,440
Hang on, Ted.
Let's hear the man out.

118
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,618
Once I have her attention,

119
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:03,028
it's time to bring out the big guns.

120
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,739
Look, I love you.

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,440
But, baby, with the little
energy I have left after work,

122
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:11,529
I want to shower you with love,

123
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:14,123
not wash some silly dishes.

124
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,657
You're right.
I'll do the dishes.

125
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,044
Right after I do this.

126
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,459
Now turn around.

127
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:32,047
Firm.

128
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,770
- Are you going to hit him or should I?
- He's right.

129
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,555
No, he's not.
Marshall, look at me.

130
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:42,312
Do not get drawn into
Barney Stinson's circus tent

131
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,248
of funhouse mirrors
and flawed logic.

132
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:46,572
This is exactly how you
got the earring back in '03.

133
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,283
- That earring looked cool.
- It did look cool, didn't it?

134
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:52,001
Stay with me!
Barney is wrong.

135
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,580
No, he isn't.

136
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,883
I hate doing my dishes right away.

137
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,377
- You just said you don't mind!
- I hate it, Ted!

138
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:03,114
I hate it with a boundless,
burning fury!

139
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:06,091
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!

140
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,389
You're welcome.

141
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,385
Hey, guys.

142
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,554
Good.
There you are.

143
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:14,391
You'll tell me the truth.
Barney says that you two never fight.

144
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,436
- I guess that's true.
- Told ya.

145
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,101
No way.
I love you both,

146
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:22,443
but you are the two most
emotionally ill-equipped

147
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,630
individuals in the history
of relationships.

148
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,570
You two must have had
at least one fight.

149
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,447
You know what?
We did.

150
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:30,680
There was one small dispute

151
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:32,785
about which one of
us was more awesome.

152
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,858
We just called it
a tie Sand had sex.

153
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,953
Speaking of which, I am so glad
we're going skiing this weekend.

154
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:41,919
I need a break. The upstairs neighbors
are driving me crazy.

155
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,295
Yeah, it's bad.

156
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,839
- I'm gonna say something to them.
- Thank you.

157
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,965
We all have our assignments
for the weekend.

158
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,284
Ted, you're going to stand up to
your neighbors and you to Lily.

159
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,846
Robin, I'm gonna need you
in sort of a crouched position

160
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,453
on the bear-skin rug
at our ski chalet. Ready?

161
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,398
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

162
00:07:58,523 --> 00:07:59,853
Have fun.

163
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,752
You know?

164
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:06,342
With his crazy, well-
thought-out theories

165
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,877
that probably would work.

166
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,957
Marshall, I'm just gonna
say this one more time.

167
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,742
- It's a bad idea.
- I think it could work.

168
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,573
Two more times.
It's a bad idea.

169
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,826
Listen, Barney lays out
some logical points

170
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:21,209
Lily is a reasonable woman.
I think that if I explain it to her,

171
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,584
she'll get it and I'll get my way.

172
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,088
No. She'll get mad,
and you'll get in a huge fight.

173
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,340
- Slap bet?
- Slap bet.

174
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,262
Baby, could you wash your dishes?

175
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:37,641
Lily, I'm glad
that you bring that up.

176
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,230
Can I stay here tonight?

177
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:46,850
I'll make up the sofa, buddy.

178
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,836
The ski bunnies are back!

179
00:08:58,318 --> 00:08:59,121
Hey, guys.

180
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,457
- How was your trip?
- So perfect.

181
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,015
We just spent the whole
weekend cuddling by the fire.

182
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,005
No black diamonds,
but a lot of red hearts.

183
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,007
- Okay, I'm gonna go unpack.
- Hey, you.

184
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:21,911
Man.

185
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:25,316
What the hell has gotten into you two?
When did you become so nauseating?

186
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:29,109
Isn't it great
to finally see her fulfilled

187
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,297
emotionally, spiritually
and sexually?

188
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,990
I dated her for a year.

189
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,160
How was your weekend?

190
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,498
Terrible, and it's all
your fault, okay?

191
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,372
I took your stupid advice!

192
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,618
Baby, could you wash your dishes?

193
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,880
Lily, I'm glad
that you bring that up.

194
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:53,607
And here is why...

195
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,559
So, it's like this, okay?

196
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:10,241
Sure.

197
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:13,195
You want me to go ahead
and wash my dish.

198
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,055
But maybe...

199
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
I want you...

200
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:18,450
to paint the ceiling,

201
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,537
right?

202
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,581
Like, maybe I should say...

203
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:25,678
"I'll wash my dish
if you get up there

204
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,627
"and just...
you paint naked babies on the ceiling."

205
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,679
You know?
It's just like...

206
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:35,590
I don't know what happened.

207
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:36,868
I'm a lawyer.

208
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:39,464
I argue for a living,
but when it comes to Lily,

209
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,932
I just get all... flustered.

210
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,894
How could you not?
I mean, the girl's all eyes and boobs.

211
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,294
What happened to the
"I'm tired after my draining day,

212
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,276
"and I want to use my leftover energy
showering you with love" argument?

213
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,217
I should have written that down.

214
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:57,658
Look, Lily, I...

215
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,158
I make more money than you.

216
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,469
Excuse me?!

217
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:05,695
Dance for me.

218
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:07,988
Dude.

219
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,516
It all made so much sense
when you said it,

220
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,620
but when I said it,
it turned into a fight.

221
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:15,187
And once Lily and I start fighting,
the fight starts...

222
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:17,631
to mutate and multiply.

223
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:20,345
<i>Sure, it started with the dishes,
but then...</i>

224
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,651
So you're saying
that you shouldn't have to wash dishes

225
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,851
because you work harder than me?

226
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,872
That's not what I'm saying...
but it's true.

227
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:31,909
<i>And then all of sudden,
we're fighting about who works harder.</i>

228
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:33,533
I teach kindergarten.

229
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,357
I am molding
the future leaders of tomorrow.

230
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,508
You eat cookies and glue stuff.

231
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,054
<i>And soon more fights spin off.</i>

232
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,927
I can't believe
you'd rather be killed...

233
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,418
<i>Until there're more fights going on
than you can keep track of.</i>

234
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:46,553
If you need to go
in the middle of the night,

235
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:49,528
either turn the bathroom light on
or sit down.

236
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:51,979
My mother does not hate you.

237
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,502
She is neutral about you.

238
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:57,158
I am not scared
of your shining impression.

239
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,260
I just don't need to hear it,
especially at night.

240
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,929
Danny's not here,

241
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,138
Mrs. Torrance.

242
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:06,022
Please don't do that.

243
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,769
Man, Lily fights dirty.

244
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,848
She's small,

245
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:13,651
but vicious like a badger
that your brother's caught

246
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,318
and starved for five days
and then put in your sleeping bag.

247
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,196
I should go home and apologize.

248
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,158
What you need is a surge.

249
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,325
Fight harder.

250
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:25,909
Picture it, Marshall.

251
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,695
Never having to wash another dish
as long as you live,

252
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,975
yet all the dishes are always clean.

253
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,250
Why, this would take all the anxiety
out of snacking.

254
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,837
No more holding open your shirt

255
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,910
to form a makeshift bowl
for your salty treats.

256
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:42,096
That world is yours, Marshall.

257
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,849
Reach out, take it,

258
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,225
dip it in some ranch dressing,

259
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:47,507
enjoy.

260
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:51,603
Yes, right.

261
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,824
Barney's stupid ideas are
what got you into this quagmire.

262
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:57,192
There's no exit strategy.
Just wash your stupid dishes.

263
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,512
Those dishes are my manhood!

264
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:01,901
And if I want to leave
my manhood dirty in the sink,

265
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:03,615
caked with ketchup and pasta...

266
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,597
- What are you eating?
- Then damn it, that's my right!

267
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:09,101
I'll wash my manhood
when I'm good and ready!

268
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:12,184
Where was he not sitting?

269
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:15,033
Barnstormer!

270
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:16,158
Ro-Ro!

271
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,427
Now you have adorable nicknames?

272
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,633
Seriously,
what's going on with your two?

273
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,469
Nothing.
We're just happy.

274
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,825
It's like Gandhi said

275
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,847
"A smile don't cost nothing, sugar."

276
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,100
I'm not sure you know who Gandhi is.

277
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,351
So, did you talk to our neighbors?

278
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,772
I did. I went up there
ready to set them straight.

279
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:47,992
They're old?

280
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,270
Really old.

281
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,496
So what did you do?

282
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,397
I didn't have the heart
to tell stop,

283
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:55,083
because, well, good for them.

284
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:58,243
So I just welcomed them to the building,
had a hard candy,

285
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,774
nodded politely at some racist comments
and then left.

286
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,052
<i>Over the next couple of days,
Barney and Robin continued to be happier</i>

287
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:07,503
<i>than ever.</i>

288
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,858
<i>And Marshall and Lily
continued to fight.</i>

289
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,358
I don't care
if the dishes aren't done.

290
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,394
If you care, you do it.

291
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,337
Great.
Then I don't care

292
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:17,844
if you have an orgasm.

293
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,691
If you care, you do it.

294
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,002
I went 18 years
without the touch of a woman.

295
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,279
I can do it again.

296
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,847
You might have to.

297
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,498
<i>And I continued
to hear more bagpiping</i>

298
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:30,570
<i>than a St. Patty's Day parade.</i>

299
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,407
I don't know what to do.

300
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:38,345
Lily and I
have never had a fight this long.

301
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,170
It's like I don't even exist.

302
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,889
On Sunday morning,
she made pancake, Ted.

303
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,420
Pancake and bacon strip.

304
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,469
It's your own fault.

305
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:50,555
You took relationship advice...
from Barney.

306
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:53,600
Well,
maybe Barney has it all figured out.

307
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:56,195
He and Ro-Ro
are the best couple now.

308
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,730
- We have been dethroned.
- You know what?

309
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:02,635
I'm not buying it. All that cutesy,
lovey-dovey crap, that's not them.

310
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,029
And I know for a fact
that Robin hates nicknames.

311
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,032
Thanks, Robbsy-Wobbsy.

312
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,751
I don't do nicknames.

313
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:13,999
Finished with the sports page,
Sherbs?

314
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:15,657
Seriously, stop.

315
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:19,042
Robin, it's T-Mose.

316
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,802
I don't like them on you either.

317
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:24,532
Well, she obviously likes them now.

318
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,058
And, come on,

319
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,885
somebody had to put an end
to T-Mose.

320
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:31,805
T-Mose was awesome.

321
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,224
I'm thinking of bringing it back.

322
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,492
Bagpiping sounds different today.

323
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,165
It's all echo-y.

324
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,381
They're in the bathroom.

325
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,526
I think they're bagpiping
on the shower chair.

326
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:47,081
<i>And just like that,
I realized exactly</i>

327
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,447
<i>how to get
the real scoop on Barney and Robin.</i>

328
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,575
How are Marshall and Lily?

329
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,659
I worry about those two,
I really do.

330
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,412
You and your big, giant heart.

331
00:15:56,562 --> 00:15:58,205
Enough.
The jig is up.

332
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,418
Whatever do you mean?

333
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,595
Who's this guy?

334
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,846
We'll get to that.

335
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,993
You see, I knew something was wrong.
You two were too happy,

336
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:09,456
too shiny, too nickname-y.

337
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,719
Didn't add up.

338
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:12,657
You two never fight?

339
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:13,782
Horse apples.

340
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:16,104
You fight all...

341
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:17,229
the...

342
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:18,201
time.

343
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:20,729
How would you know that?

344
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,062
Phil told me.

345
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:23,815
Who the hell is Phil?

346
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:25,820
Your downstairs neighbor.

347
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:28,048
I'm Phil.

348
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,404
12-B.

349
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,209
And he's heard...

350
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,590
everything.

351
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:37,912
So Phil tells me

352
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,105
that Ro-Ro and the Barnstormer
have been fighting...

353
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,470
a lot.

354
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:43,895
Care to explain?

355
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:50,720
Everything was going great.

356
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,145
Our no-fighting techniques
were working perfectly

357
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,847
until we went on that ski trip
last weekend.

358
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:59,798
So I showed Marshall
that Lily's argument was bananas,

359
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:02,218
and now he'll never have to wash
another dish.

360
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:03,343
High two.

361
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,190
That's terrible advice.

362
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:07,567
You agree with Lily?

363
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:09,258
You...

364
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,534
<i>We're about to get in a fight,
and I can't run away.</i>

365
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:19,471
<i>I can't take my clothes off.
It's freezing up here.</i>

366
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:20,872
<i>I get hypothermia.</i>

367
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,283
<i>Maybe I can jump it?</i>

368
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,792
<i>Maybe just my pants?</i>

369
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,962
This no-fighting thing is over.

370
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:30,799
I think so.

371
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,179
- How could you possibly agree with her?
- I can't believe that you made Lily... 

372
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,307
And it didn't end there.
We've been fighting ever since.

373
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:42,531
All those fights we kept not having...
they all came back around.

374
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:44,968
- The bag of panties.
- The tie Robin murdered.

375
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:47,373
The tiny camera
I found in the headboard.

376
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,344
That's
how a quarterback stays sharp.

377
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,531
Monday morning, he sits on a bag of ice
and studies the game tape.

378
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,748
- Barney, for the millionth time...
- You don't get to be as good as I am...

379
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,996
I knew it! I knew you guys
were acting too cute and perfect!

380
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,234
Look, we were just sick
of everyone pointing out

381
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,780
how crappy at relationships
we both are.

382
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:10,548
It was sort of nice
to be the perfect couple for a minute.

383
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,965
I knew you were lying.

384
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,260
You got to wake up pretty early
to slip one by the T-Mose.

385
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,429
Stop it.

386
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,560
Dinner's ready.

387
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,718
Did you make any for me?

388
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:26,111
No, but it's your favorite.

389
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:37,532
We need your advice.

390
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,744
<i>So Barney and Robin told them
all about their fighting.</i>

391
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,735
<i>And let's just say,
that in comparison,</i>

392
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,873
<i>their little dishes spat
seemed pretty tame.</i>

393
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,510
<i>And by the end,</i>

394
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,887
<i>Lily and Marshall both
had the same reaction.</i>

395
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,056
I'll wash my dishes right away
from now until the day I die.

396
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,036
I don't care
when you wash the dishes.

397
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,853
But if it's with cheese-based
like a nice ziti, at least soak it.

398
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,146
Of course, baby.

399
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,030
I love you.

400
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,455
I love you, too.

401
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:12,734
See?

402
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,403
How did you just do that?
How'd you just fix everything?

403
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:19,491
I don't know. I guess sometimes
you just have to set your ego aside.

404
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,673
And remember
that the love that you have

405
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,039
for that other person
is way more important than winning.

406
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:33,055
More important than winning.

407
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,592
Stop, stop it.

408
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,302
Seriously, what's the secret?

409
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,511
Look, the honeymoon period may be over,
but...

410
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:43,206
now you can get into the real stuff.

411
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,789
And honestly,

412
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,643
that's the best part.

413
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,107
Good night.

414
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,531
So what do we do now?

415
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,656
I guess we got to start talking more
and get into the real stuff.

416
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:54,943
Or...

417
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,528
there's a bench in the elevator.

418
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,896
That's better.

419
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:00,323
So what
if we're not the best couple?

420
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:02,695
Totally.
It's not a competition.

421
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,970
We win!

422
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:05,843
Best couple in the world!

423
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:10,365
Guess what?

424
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,210
These glasses...

425
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,689
are plastic.

426
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:15,715
So we can just throw them away.

427
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,232
That means
no dirty dishes in the sink.

428
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:20,782
You're dirty.

429
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,221
Maybe I should leave you
in the sink.

430
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,812
<i>And once
that first argument got worked out,</i>

431
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,310
<i>all those other arguments,</i>

432
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,047
<i>well,</i>

433
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:32,799
<i>they got better, too.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
