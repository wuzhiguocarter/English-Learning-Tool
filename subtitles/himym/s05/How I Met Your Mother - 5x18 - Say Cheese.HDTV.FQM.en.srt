1
00:00:00,827 --> 00:00:03,295
<i>Lily has always
been one of those people</i>

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:05,397
<i>who loves their birthday.
Loves it.</i>

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:09,668
It's my birthday!

4
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:16,208
<i>So it's a good thing
she married Marshall.</i>

5
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:20,612
It's still my birthday!

6
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:23,182
<i>Because he loves
planning birthdays.</i>

7
00:00:23,183 --> 00:00:26,018
<i>Feliz cumpleaÃ±os, baby.</i>

8
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,420
The theme of this today's
birthday breakfast

9
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:30,355
in bed is...

10
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,157
"Spanish Interlude"

11
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:33,892
âª âª

12
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:35,527
Ooh!

13
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:37,428
And...

14
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,098
How on Earth did we end up

15
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:42,201
in the lyrical rolling hills
of Northern Spain?

16
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:43,469
Yay!

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,238
Baby, tonight is going
to be so much fun.

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,372
Just the five of us,

19
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,408
black-tie dinner,
and Ted is picking up

20
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,777
your favorite cognac pumpkin
cheesecake from Edgar's.

21
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:52,744
Yay!

22
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:53,912
Okay, I am off

23
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:56,515
to run your super secret
birthday errand.

24
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:57,716
Yay!

25
00:00:57,717 --> 00:01:00,652
And I'm taking
this guy with me

26
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:02,621
because I don't like the way
he's looking at you.

27
00:01:02,622 --> 00:01:04,522
Yay.

28
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,460
A new camera!

29
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:11,130
Oh, thank you, Marshall.
I love it!

30
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,498
Well, little bonus:

31
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,434
I took some naked pictures
of myself before I wrapped it.

32
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:16,735
Put a bow on it.

33
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:18,270
There wasn't a bow on it.

34
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,973
Wrong "it."

35
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:22,307
Thank you, honey.
I'm going to get

36
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:24,610
some great shots of our
little group with this.

37
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:27,146
<i>Now, kids, you've seen
your Aunt Lily's</i>

38
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:29,715
<i>photo albums:
leather bound,</i>

39
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:31,550
<i>acid free paper,</i>

40
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,819
adorable handwritten captions.

41
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,889
<i>And most importantly,
the group shot.</i>

42
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,323
<i>Cute photo, right, kids?</i>

43
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:39,958
<i>But what you don't see
is what happened</i>

44
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,294
<i>ten seconds
before this picture was taken.</i>

45
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:44,830
Okay, I want to get
the perfect group shot.

46
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,431
Marshall, sit between
Barney and Robin.

47
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:48,400
Why?

48
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,169
Oh, you know,
uh, light,

49
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,104
color, balance, aperture...

50
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:53,572
You're just saying
camera words.

51
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,307
Wait- you don't want
Barney and me

52
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,176
to look like a couple
in this picture,

53
00:01:57,177 --> 00:01:58,577
do you?
Of course I don't!

54
00:01:58,578 --> 00:01:59,811
You two aren't going to last!

55
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:01,079
I'm going for timeless here.

56
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,814
How dare you?

57
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:04,082
That is so rude!

58
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,150
It's true.

59
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:06,318
Totally true-
we're running

60
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,219
on fumes here,
but still rude.

61
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:11,690
<i>We hated Lily's group shots.</i>

62
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,561
Okay, maybe I get
a little bossy,

63
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,696
but I just want
to remember those times.

64
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:19,064
Like tonight.

65
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:21,533
I can't imagine
a better birthday than,

66
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:24,403
than being here with just
my four best friends.

67
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:26,471
Yay!

68
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:28,840
And Ted's here now. Yay!
Oh!

69
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:33,946
Happy birthday!

70
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:35,747
This is Amanda.

71
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:38,717
And Amanda... yay.

72
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:55,601
Ted, you were supposed
to bring a cheesecake,

73
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,269
but instead you
brought two grocery bags

74
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,937
and a woman we've
never seen before.

75
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:00,906
Hi. I'm Marshall.
Welcome to our home.

76
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,040
Start talking.

77
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,243
Amanda's going to make
Lily a cake.

78
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:05,310
She's a chef.

79
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,945
We met when I was
at a restaurant

80
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:09,047
last week and I sent
some soup back.

81
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:10,816
Lucky, she's got
such pretty hair

82
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,451
I didn't mind eating
a little bit of it.

83
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:14,353
They call me
"The Shedder" at work.

84
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:18,290
I'm so glad you're
making my birthday cake!

85
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,058
<i>In honor of Lily's</i>

86
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,627
32nd birthday,
I've got

87
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:24,663
a lot of great games
planned, starting with...

88
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,798
"Lil-ial Pursuit."

89
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,134
Okay, who's
got number one?

90
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:30,302
I do.

91
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:31,536
Of course you do.

92
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:33,705
Okay, Amanda
goes first.

93
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,440
32 seconds on the clock

94
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,811
to answer as many questions
as possible. And...

95
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:41,613
Go! Question one:

96
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:42,881
What is Lily's favorite color?

97
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:45,784
Well, she's wearing pink,

98
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:47,519
so I'm going
to say pink.

99
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Okay, that's Robin.

100
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,122
Oh, uh...

101
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:51,423
Her...

102
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,892
favorite color is...

103
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:55,793
elbow.

104
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:59,698
I believe Ted was mouthing
the word "yellow."

105
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,067
Which also
would have been wrong.

106
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:09,107
This game is called
"Gilding The Lily."

107
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:10,776
Nice.
Thank you.

108
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:12,010
Okay, you've all
written down

109
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,979
your favorite things
about the birthday girl.

110
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,648
And Lilypad,
you guess who wrote what.

111
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,683
"Lily makes

112
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:18,817
"everyone in her life,

113
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,385
from her friends
to her students..."

114
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,620
Lily's a kindergarten teacher-

115
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:22,988
that's what he means
by "students."

116
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:23,955
"...feel loved.

117
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:25,457
"She makes the best

118
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,692
"oatmeal raisin cookies ever,

119
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,627
<i>can recite every line
from Goonies..."</i>

120
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:31,296
<i>Lily saw Goonies in the theater
right after her parents separated.</i>

121
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:33,465
For a long time after that, she
had real trouble trusting people...

122
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,667
Ted!

123
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,736
"And she's the strongest person
I've ever met.

124
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,172
"I can't imagine
my life without her.

125
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:41,740
I love you, Lily."

126
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,142
Aww... Robin!

127
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:45,744
Of course it was me.

128
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,312
Come on.
Aww, that's so sweet.

129
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:50,115
Okay, Lily,
you try to guess

130
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,084
who wrote this.

131
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,458
"You seem really nice."

132
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,860
Oh...

133
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,428
I'm going
to guess Amanda?

134
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,329
No, that w me.

135
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,565
And I meant every word.

136
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,669
Well, I should get back
to that cake.

137
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,871
Okay, let me know
if you need anything.

138
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,776
All right, quick!
Let's do the group photo!

139
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,211
Everybody gather
around the fireplace.

140
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:21,780
Oh, uh, hang on, I'll, uh,
I'll let Amanda know.

141
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,415
Oh, no, that's okay.
She's busy in the kitchen.

142
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,150
Let's not bother her. Come on.

143
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:26,785
Hey, hang on a second.
You...

144
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,354
You don't want Amanda
in the photo, do you?

145
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:31,123
No, no, it's just, you know,

146
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,925
auto-focus,
shutter speed, zoom...

147
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:36,061
Lily, what's going on?

148
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,462
Who wants a party hat?

149
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:40,098
Hey, look!
Look, I'm a bird!

150
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's all be birds.

151
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,301
Lily, tell me the truth.

152
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,170
No, of course not.
I'm not going to let

153
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:49,374
another one of your dumb skanks
ruin my precious memories.

154
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,427
Lily, what are you
talking about?

155
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:59,863
Ted, you always do this.

156
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:01,899
You bring girls
that we barely know

157
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,500
to all our big group events.

158
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,502
I do not.
Oh, really?

159
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:07,804
Oh, well, let's just
take a little walk

160
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:10,307
down Random Skank Lane.

161
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,176
Or, or we could just
keep on a-strolling down

162
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:14,912
Best Birthday Ever Avenue.

163
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:17,781
Do I get a vote?
Skank Lane! Skank Lane!

164
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:20,517
Hey, hey, guys. I've composed
a song for the evening.

165
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:22,719
Follow along.
The chorus goes like this:

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,888
âª Happy, happy Lily day âª

167
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,189
âª Happy, happy
Lily day... âª

168
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,191
Christmas morning,
four years ago.

169
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:32,996
Our first Christmas together,
just the five of us.

170
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:35,198
Ooh, Ted, here's another
fun little trivia me.

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,901
It's called:
Name That Bitch.

172
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:44,241
It's, it is Sa... San...

173
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:46,343
Wrong. You're
thinking of Santa,

174
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:48,045
'cause it was Christmas.

175
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:50,247
Fun fact- each year,
my mother has Easter tea

176
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:52,148
with her friend Bunny.

177
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,650
Okay, not that fun.

178
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:55,953
I remember her name.

179
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:57,020
It's Sarah.

180
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,523
Close. It's Leilani.

181
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,592
She just had to come
to Christmas because you said,

182
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,760
"Guys, she might be the one."

183
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:05,662
And she's
not the only

184
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,065
"might be the one."

185
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,267
New Year's Eve, 2007:

186
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,636
Barney, Lily, Robin,
Ted, Marshall

187
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:15,038
and "She's the One" Emily.

188
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,207
Robin's Uncle Cecil's funeral:

189
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,243
Marshall, Lily,
Robin, Barney, Ted and...

190
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,346
"this just proves
you find the one

191
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:24,514
when you're not looking" Isabel.

192
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,316
My appenx surgery:

193
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:29,252
Robin, Marshall,
Barney, Lily, Ted, and...

194
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:32,189
Well, this one you admitted
you were just trying to bang.

195
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,391
Respect.
Oh, hey.

196
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:35,826
Remember this yoga instructor

197
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:37,361
you brought
to my birthday last year?

198
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:38,762
âª You. âª

199
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:39,963
Thank you.

200
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:41,264
Thank you.
Oh, my- oh, my God.

201
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:42,933
You guys are not going
to believe who just came in.

202
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,835
Don't look.
Don't look!

203
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:46,169
Why aren't you looking?!

204
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,205
It's Slash
from Guns N' Roses!

205
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,542
Okay, okay, group shot.
Group shot!

206
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:54,511
And we got it.

207
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:58,048
We got a picture
with Slash on my birthday.

208
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:00,117
Awesome, right? Right?

209
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:01,652
We were there.
We know how this ends.

210
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,553
Wrong!

211
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,189
You know what's funny
about this picture?

212
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,858
He was grabbing my ass.
Really?

213
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:09,826
He was grabbing my ass, too.
He was grabbing

214
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,928
my ass, too- how many hands
does that guy have?

215
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:14,064
No wonder he's such
a good guitarist.

216
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:17,100
Actually, I'm sorry dude,
I thought that you were Lily.

217
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,236
Wait a second.
Look at these pictures again.

218
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:21,571
Barney has the same pose
in each shot

219
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:24,174
and these are,
like, years apart.

220
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,480
Ah, yes, about that:

221
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:32,916
I never take a bad picture.

222
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:34,518
Never have, never will.

223
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,487
There has to be
a bad picture of you.

224
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:38,889
Nope, not one.

225
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,090
What about from
elementary school?

226
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,758
Everyone has bad
pictures from school.

227
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,659
Not the Barnacle.

228
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:46,797
<i>I always look</i>

229
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:49,266
drop dead, stone cold amazing.

230
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:52,502
Unlike Marshall, who just looks
dead, stoned and cold.

231
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,137
<i>He was right, kids.</i>

232
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:56,440
<i>Your Uncle Marshall
does a lot of things well,</i>

233
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:59,009
<i>but he does not take
a good picture.</i>

234
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,446
<i>They're not</i>

235
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:04,981
all bad, okay?
Like... here.

236
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:07,050
Here, look at this one.
My eyes are open.

237
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,385
Marshall, no!
Oh, you did

238
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,820
put a bow on it.

239
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:10,987
Chip and dip, Barney?

240
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:13,123
Sure.

241
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:14,124
Aha!

242
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,860
Got it! A bad picture.

243
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,761
Is it though?

244
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:22,666
No! Wait!

245
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,900
You were eating a chip!

246
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,736
Where's the chip?

247
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:29,239
It is physically impossible
for me to take a bad picture.

248
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,475
I don't know why.
Ask God.

249
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,878
Look, Lily,
I'm sorry about Amanda.

250
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,012
I'm just going to say it.

251
00:09:36,013 --> 00:09:37,913
You are being
a birthday brat.

252
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:40,517
You're all bent out
of shape just 'cause

253
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:41,885
you think I ruined
a couple pictures.

254
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,053
Oh, Ted.

255
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:44,621
These girls have ruined

256
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:49,626
so many events,
or are you forgetting Paris?

257
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,061
What happened in Paris?

258
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:54,464
It was junior year and I was
studying abroad in Paris,

259
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:56,199
and I hadn't seen
Marshall for two months.

260
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,701
Two months.

261
00:09:57,702 --> 00:09:59,936
And I had just started
having sex.

262
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:02,139
I wasn't ready to stop
for two months.

263
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,108
And Marshall was coming
to visit over spring break.

264
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:08,445
And at the last minute,
Ted decided to come

265
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:12,849
with the girl he had just
gotten back together with, Karen.

266
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,951
Karen.

267
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:17,120
I am so excited you're here.

268
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:19,122
I'm so excited
to go to Paris.

269
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:21,558
I'm so excited
to have sex again.

270
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,661
<i>But just before the plane
took off...</i>

271
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:27,397
Wait, I want to tell
you something.

272
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:30,801
Really? 'Cause I think I want
to tell you the same thing.

273
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:32,269
Is your thing, I had sex

274
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,237
with my philosophy
professor last night?

275
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:37,407
'Cause that's my thing.

276
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:40,210
<i>And thus began the longest
seven and a half hours</i>

277
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:41,912
<i>of Marshall's life.</i>

278
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:44,414
âª âª

279
00:10:52,223 --> 00:10:54,624
<i>When I picked them up
at the airport...</i>

280
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,393
Ted broke up with me.

281
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,528
I need to sleep
in your room this week.

282
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,429
Marshall can bunk with Ted.

283
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:07,938
Two months!

284
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,273
<i>My balls were bleu! Bleu!</i>

285
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:11,708
This will come

286
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:15,078
as no shock, but the rest
of the trip was terrible.

287
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,055
<i>And all I wanted was</i>

288
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:26,223
a romantic kiss picture

289
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:28,425
in front
of the Eiffel Tower, which

290
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:30,360
I actually did get.

291
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:33,763
<i>It just happened to be between
Karen and Francois,</i>

292
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:36,566
our waiter from the day before.

293
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:37,734
Wow, that's just awful.

294
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:39,436
Just... Ugh!
Just-Just...

295
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:40,637
Oopsies! Hey.

296
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:42,873
I dropped my phone. You mind
picking it up for me?

297
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:44,641
Oh, sure. Smile,
you son of a bitch!

298
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:46,076
Got it!

299
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:48,378
Did you, though?

300
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,482
Wait. How do you do that?!

301
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,117
You weren't even standing up!

302
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:55,385
The camera loves me, Robin.

303
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,586
More than loves me.

304
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:57,787
The camera lusts after me.

305
00:11:57,788 --> 00:12:00,257
The camera wants
to put on some nice lingerie,

306
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:01,625
pop in an Al Green CD,

307
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:03,593
dim the lights
and do all the work

308
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,896
while I just lie there
with my eyes closed.

309
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:08,031
Look, I'm sorry
about Paris

310
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,833
and all the ruined
group shots,

311
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,968
but when you're
single, you got to hope

312
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,004
that each next new
girl is the one.

313
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,272
I mean, Erin.
Emily.

314
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:16,473
Irene.
Or Isabel.

315
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,008
And Sarah.
It's Leilani.

316
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,509
What is wrong with you?

317
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,877
At the time,
yes, I thought

318
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,779
each of these girls
could be the one,

319
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,114
but I got to stay hopeful.

320
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:25,348
I mean, what's
the alternative?

321
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:26,549
Here's the alternative.

322
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,319
How about no more random skanks
at my birthday!

323
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:31,821
Hey, sweetie!

324
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:34,124
Hi. Uh, do you guys
have a cooling rack?

325
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,458
Oh, drawer under the oven.

326
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,594
Can't wait.
You're just the best!

327
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:40,230
Ted, I'm sorry.

328
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,898
I gonna have
to agree with Lily on this.

329
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,366
I mean, these kind
of events

330
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:44,734
are hard for a new person.

331
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,503
That's why
I didn't bring Don tonight.

332
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,438
I mean, when I lived
in Japan,

333
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,940
this guy, for our third date,

334
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,142
brought me
to his brother's wedding.

335
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:55,245
<i>Now, I- a total stranger-</i>

336
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,514
<i>am in that Japanese couple's
wedding picture</i>

337
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,883
<i>for all eternity.</i>

338
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,687
Uh...

339
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:06,389
Yeah, Ted, I think you
should listen to Robin.

340
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,259
Right, right, 'cause...
'cause Robin's your best friend.

341
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,493
Mm.
Exactly.

342
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:11,394
Your best friend
in the whole world.

343
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:12,529
Absolutely.

344
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,798
Careful, Lily. It's a trap.

345
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,633
And before she was your
best friend, what was she?

346
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,168
Oh, that's right.

347
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,403
One of my random skanks.

348
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,538
Hey!

349
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,739
Okay, yes, Ted.

350
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,341
This particular skank... Hey!

351
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:25,642
...happened
to work out,

352
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,243
but she's the
skanky exception,

353
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:28,545
not the skanky rule.

354
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,580
Okay, I'm crying
a little bit. Okay.

355
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:33,950
Hey, guys, that about wraps up
this whole skank conversation.

356
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:36,619
Let's get back
to the birthday song!

357
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,690
Okay, um, Barney,
your part goes like this.

358
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:47,263
âª She's cute âª

359
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:50,800
âª She's cute. âª

360
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,435
Lily, I bring girls
to these events

361
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,070
because you guys
are important to me.

362
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,238
You're my family.

363
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,007
And, oh, hey, Robin.
Hey, Robin, Robin,

364
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,641
your part goes
like this.

365
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:03,480
âª And nice and nice âª

366
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:07,717
âª And also nice! âª

367
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:09,519
Yes. We're a family.

368
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,789
So why can't these
events ever just be us?

369
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,326
<i>Like the time we celebrated
Marshall passing the bar exam.</i>

370
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,727
Hey.
Hey, guys.

371
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:20,397
This is the disgusting,
smelly hippie I'm dating.

372
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:21,698
Hey!

373
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,299
I did not say that!

374
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,168
Well, you might
as well have.

375
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:27,570
Hey, guys.
This is Strawberry.

376
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:28,938
Hey!

377
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,540
Um, should we
order more food?

378
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,442
Oh, no. Uh,
Strawberry's not eating.

379
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,844
I'm a vegetarian.

380
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:37,414
Okay.

381
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:39,682
Well, let's all raise a glass.

382
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:40,850
Mm.

383
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:42,619
For the last three years,

384
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,687
Marshall has been
working so hard,

385
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:46,456
and I am so proud of you.

386
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:48,357
Meat is murder!

387
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,160
Murder!

388
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,630
Okay, I admit it.

389
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,864
Strawberry was a mistake.

390
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:56,332
But how could I have known that
going in?

391
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,003
Her name was Strawberry.

392
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:01,237
Look, if it's such a big deal,

393
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:02,872
Amanda doesn't have to be
in the group photo.

394
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:04,574
But I promise she's not gonna
ruin your birthday.

395
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,775
Just-Just give her a chance.

396
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,043
See, look, guys.

397
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:08,244
We're all friends again!

398
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,380
Now let's work
on those harmonies.

399
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:12,582
âª Happy happy Lily day! âª

400
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,752
âª Happy happy
Lily day... âª

401
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:18,021
All done.

402
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:20,790
I hope you like it.

403
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:28,198
"Happy 42nd birthday, Lori."

404
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:30,834
<i>Kids, you know how</i>

405
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:33,103
<i>I've told you about Lily's
"you're dead to me" look-</i>

406
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,838
<i>that expression
she gets just before</i>

407
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,773
<i>she explodes
in white-hot rage?</i>

408
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:39,142
<i>Well, this wasn't it.</i>

409
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:46,349
<i>But this was Marshall's.</i>

410
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,118
"42nd"?

411
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,586
Does this

412
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:52,055
hot piece of ass look 42 to you?

413
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:56,626
<i>Or! Or does she look
like her name is Lori?!</i>

414
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:59,262
No, Marshall, it's okay.
No, Lily, it's not okay.

415
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:02,198
Ted, get this stranger
out of my house!

416
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,267
I am so sorry.
Out!

417
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:21,718
âª Happy, happy Lily day âª

418
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,254
âª Happy, happy
Lily day. âª

419
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,799
Well... Amanda refused
to come back.

420
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,100
She thinks you guys hate her.

421
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,769
Marshall, you have
to go apologize.

422
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,206
You ruin Lily's birthday
and you want me to apologize?

423
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,809
If anything, you should
apologize to me.

424
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,377
What are you talking about?

425
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,946
Ted, you bring girls
to these intimate events

426
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:49,015
and it makes them think that
things are really serious.

427
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:50,617
And then when you
break up with them,

428
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,185
you know who they turn to?

429
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:55,422
Me. I've been your girlfriend
cleanup crew for yea.

430
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,190
<i>February, 2005.</i>

431
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:59,793
<i>I had just come back
from a marathon study session</i>

432
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:01,594
<i>at the law library.
Hey.</i>

433
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,763
Hey, Natalie,
where's, uh, where's Ted?

434
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:07,634
We broke up... again!

435
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:10,170
Uh-oh.

436
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:12,739
Won't you sit with me
for a little while?

437
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,874
Just sit?

438
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,610
Man, you know what? I've been up
for, like, 36 hours.

439
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:22,681
Just for a few minutes.

440
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,858
And at first,
I was completely sympathetic.

441
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,059
But damn it, Ted,

442
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,228
over the years,
you made me cynical.

443
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,430
You know what? I'm going to
go get us some Rocky Road,

444
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,267
and we're just going to sit here
and talk it out until it makes sense.

445
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,038
I just thought we had
something so special, you know?

446
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,607
Me, too. Yeah.

447
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,277
But, you know, life
goes on, sweetheart.

448
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,581
I don't know how I'm going to put
my life back together after this.

449
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:56,749
Oh, shut up.

450
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:00,253
Well, I'm sorry my search
for true love has been

451
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:02,222
such an inconvenience
to you guys.

452
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:04,624
You know what?
Maybe your precious pictures

453
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,359
would look a lot better
if I wasn't in them.

454
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,995
They'd look a lot better if Marshall
weren't in them. Cheap shot, bro.

455
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,296
Cheap shot.

456
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,165
You know what these
pictures are, Lily?

457
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,633
They're a big, fat lie.

458
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,401
They're posed.
They're touched up.

459
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:17,504
They're what you want our life
to be, not what it is.

460
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,806
That's not true!
Oh, yeah? Okay.

461
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,907
Look at this one.

462
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,642
Halloween,
two years ago.

463
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,110
You and Marshall
got in a huge fight

464
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:25,645
because you didn't want
to dress up as penguins.

465
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,380
No, no-no, it's not just
that she didn't want to.

466
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:30,416
It's that she called
penguins "lame." Penguins.

467
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:31,851
And yet, here you are,

468
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:34,721
smiling like nothing's
wrong- completely phony.

469
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:38,224
Robin's birthday,
three years ago.

470
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:40,059
Robin had a cold
and you made her

471
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,427
change out of her
pajama's for the picture.

472
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:42,462
And then you pinched my cheeks

473
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:44,364
really hard to get
some color in them.

474
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:46,599
Yeah, but you look pretty.

475
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,736
And then, we all ate
chocolate cake in my bed.

476
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:52,171
Actually, that was
a really nice night.

477
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,506
Yeah, it was.

478
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,308
Yeah, I guess it was.

479
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,744
Hey, look at this one.

480
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,712
This is the first picture

481
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:01,381
the three of us
ever took together.

482
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,749
That's right. It was.

483
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,418
Yeah, you remember
how it happened?

484
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:06,819
Okay, ready?

485
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,987
Wait, wait, wait.

486
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:09,188
What pose should we do?

487
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,089
Buddy cop picture?

488
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:14,227
Oh, no, no-no!
What about, um, '80s sitcom

489
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:16,863
about two roommates who never
agree on anything? Mm-hmm.

490
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,966
Nice. Okay,
one, two...

491
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,236
Hi, Marshall.

492
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:24,604
Ready for the movie?

493
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,673
Um, yeah. Just a
second though, okay?

494
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,041
We're about to
make history.

495
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,243
We're about to take our
first ever roommate picture.

496
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:32,745
Yeah. Hey, why don't you
get in the picture, too?

497
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:33,846
Really?

498
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,248
Yeah.

499
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,083
What are you doing, Ted?
What if we break up?

500
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:38,984
What if you don't?

501
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,453
Come on.
Come on.

502
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,226
I forgot all about that.

503
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,963
Marshall and I had just
been dating a few weeks

504
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:53,166
and you invited me
into the picture.

505
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:55,902
I liked you.

506
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,270
We have to get Amanda back.

507
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:58,638
Really?
Ted,

508
00:19:58,639 --> 00:19:59,739
you believed in me.

509
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,541
It's my turn
to believe in you.

510
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,010
For all I know,
she's the one.

511
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:06,212
Thanks, Lil.

512
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:08,548
I think Lori's age
has made her very wise.

513
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:12,685
They say your forties are when you
really get to know yourself. Hmm.

514
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:15,521
<i>So, your Aunt Lily
called Amanda.</i>

515
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:17,523
All right, people,
gather around.

516
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:19,392
Let's make a memory.

517
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:21,361
Okay, Marshall-
Marshall, try this.

518
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:23,796
Keep your eyes closed
until the last second,

519
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,898
and when I say so,
open them. Okay.

520
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:28,201
Hey, Barney, is that
a hole in your suit jacket?

521
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:30,103
What? Where?

522
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,004
Now, Marshall!

523
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,641
<i>Damn it!</i>

524
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:40,459
Ted, name that bitch.

525
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,296
Birth... a?
Bertha?

526
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:45,698
No, it was my birthday.

527
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:48,601
Your brain makes associations
in a very obvious way.

528
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:50,002
All right, people.

529
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:52,405
Gather around.
Let's make a memory.

530
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,508
Hey, Robin, what's in
