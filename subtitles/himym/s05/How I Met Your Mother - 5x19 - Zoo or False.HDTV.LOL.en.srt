1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,249
Kids, you may be wondering

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,680
How many of these stories
I'm telling you are true.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,919
It's a fair question.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,249
After all, there's a fine line

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,120
Between a good story
and a bald-faced lie.

6
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:12,454
I've never met anyone

7
00:00:12,455 --> 00:00:14,454
Who could work that line
better than your Uncle Barney.

8
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:16,784
Heck, he could jump rope with it.

9
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:18,385
I love to travel myself.

10
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:19,294
Really?

11
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,994
Where's the best
place you've visited?

12
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:22,294
Hawaii's nice.

13
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:24,894
A buddy of mine lives in Seattle.

14
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:25,664
That's a good spot.

15
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:27,364
But the best place?

16
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:29,264
I'd have to say the moon.

17
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,303
Hi. Neil Armstrong.

18
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:33,841
No! You did not convince
a girl that you were

19
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:35,672
The first man to walk on the moon!

20
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,922
That happened seven years
before you were born!

21
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:41,132
Ted, baby doll, minor hurdle.

22
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:44,462
Oh, yeah, well, our spaceship
passed through a wormhole

23
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:46,686
Or some gamma Rays or something.

24
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:49,625
I started aging backwards,
blah, blah, blah.

25
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,271
So, you work in a yogurt shop.
That must be wild.

26
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:58,000
Although, I did actually work In
a yogurt store in High School.

27
00:00:58,046 --> 00:00:59,631
And it was indeed...

28
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:02,038
Wild.

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,178
Anyhoo, 20 minutes later,
the eagle landed.

30
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:08,639
We knocked Space boots.

31
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:11,248
Houston, we have a moaner.

32
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:15,518
Other Space-related
double entendres.

33
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,360
Why do you feel the need
to lie all the time?

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,694
I'm not lying!

35
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,318
Guys, we made sweet love.

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,619
I got pictures.

37
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:26,850
I hate my job.

38
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,972
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,120
I thought you just
interviewed the mayor.

40
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,620
Mayor mcwoof.

41
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:33,020
He wears a dog costume and
teaches kids not to litter.

42
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:35,260
At least He's supposed to.

43
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,660
Oh, I don't want to
talk about mayor mcwoof.

44
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:42,078
I want to talk about these amazing
insoles From bon appe-feet!

45
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:44,367
Just look how
shock-absorbent they are!

46
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,973
Prop table! Table's a prop!

47
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,271
We'll be right back.

48
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:52,610
We'll be right back.

49
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,910
Oh. Sorry, Robin.

50
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:56,480
Got bored.

51
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,611
Yeah, I don't blame you.

52
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:04,320
Man, just one decent interview
Would be so nice for a change.

53
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,849
Fine. I'll look at my schedule,
see when I'm available.

54
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,873
But I want a list of
questions ahead of time,

55
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:11,246
And my personal life is off limits.

56
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,814
Ted, you caught seven
peanuts in a row.

57
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,903
It's impressive,
but it's not newsworthy.

58
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:19,303
- You caught seven in a row?
- Seven in a row.

59
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:20,903
But that's not what I'm
talking about that.

60
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:24,213
No. I'm talking about how
I was selected to build

61
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:26,605
A scale model of the
empire state building

62
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,413
For the largest recreation Of the
New York skyline in the world.

63
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:32,653
Is that the thing you were
playing with the other night?

64
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:34,451
I wasn't playing.

65
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,153
I was working.

66
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,323
"it's you."

67
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,593
"it's me."

68
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,593
"I saw you in the street.

69
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,994
Are you Annie?"

70
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:43,801
"yes."

71
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:47,632
Ted, are you acting
out the last scene

72
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,703
Of sleepless in Seattle
with little dolls?

73
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,426
How long have you been out here?

74
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:53,590
Ten seconds.

75
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,543
Yeah. Just the last scene.

76
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,615
Oh, Ted. Again?

77
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:00,549
Ooh. That's the pizza.

78
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:01,839
Baby, do you have any cash?

79
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:05,464
Oh. You know, uh,
I don't... I actually...

80
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:07,354
I don't think that I
should Have to pay.

81
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:11,632
'cause I'm not a fan of pizza.

82
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,501
What?!

83
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:15,670
Marshall, we've driven
halfway across the country

84
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:17,929
For a piece of pizza
literally hundreds of times.

85
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,249
I once caught you eating
pizza in the shower.

86
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,519
Marshall, there's a cartoon
of you on our coupons.

87
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,749
I'm not saying Marshall's
a guy who likes pizza,

88
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,078
But last time he went
in for a physical,

89
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,946
Doctor says, "marshall,
you got to stop eating pizza."

90
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:31,177
Marshall says, "why?" doc says,
"so I can examine you."

91
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,145
But seriously,
we kid because we love.

92
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:34,839
All right, look, the reason

93
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:38,191
That I don't have any
money on me is because...

94
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,257
I got mugged.

95
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,887
You...? What?

96
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:47,361
Can somebody please pay Arthur?
All right? I'm starving!

97
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,172
How's your dad, by the way? Better.

98
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:51,119
Good. Mm. Mm.

99
00:03:51,492 --> 00:04:01,705
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

100
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,862
Oh, my God, you got mugged?!

101
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:06,679
Who mugged you?

102
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,071
Was he wearing a black skull-knit
cap And a five o'clock shadow?

103
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,271
Did he say, "stick 'em up?"

104
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:13,103
Yes, Barney, because
I got mugged in 1947

105
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:15,242
At the corner of abbott
and costello. No.

106
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:18,451
I was cutting through central
park on my way home from work...

107
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:20,551
Watch it.

108
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,851
Don't get any closer.

109
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:25,722
It's cool. It's cool.

110
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:30,691
It was... Completely terrifying.

111
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:34,261
It was... Completely terrifying.

112
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,201
What are you doing?

113
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:35,890
I'm rehearsing.

114
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:37,213
I'm gonna pretend this
happened to me later

115
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,601
To try and get some sympathy sex.

116
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:40,571
Barney, that won't work.

117
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:41,981
Will it?

118
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,213
Big time. I'll allow it.

119
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:47,493
I can't believe Someone pointed
a gun at my marshmallow.

120
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:48,861
Now, I'm shaking.

121
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:50,830
I-I don't think I'm going
to be able to sleep tonight.

122
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,410
Oh! Here, sweetie. I have something
that will help you sleep.

123
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,289
Just stick this under your pillow.

124
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:58,671
You'll sleep like a freakin' baby.

125
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,171
Robin, put that away.

126
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:01,563
It's not going to hurt anyone.

127
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:03,920
The safety's... on.

128
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:05,748
Okay, you know what?

129
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:07,681
Let's all just relax.

130
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,299
We don't need a gun.

131
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:12,439
I'd just like to forget
this ever happened

132
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,821
And try to move on with my life.

133
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,999
Just like to forget
this ever happened

134
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,914
And try to move on with my life.

135
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:18,912
This is great stuff.

136
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:20,261
I think I'm gonna
add tears, though.

137
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:24,231
Listen, baby, I know that it's scary,
but look at me.

138
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,402
I'm fine, okay?

139
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,701
Can we just put this behind us?

140
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:29,551
Oh, that's gold, but I'm going

141
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:30,971
To switch it to "
put me behind you."

142
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,860
Look, baby, you don't
have to worry about me.

143
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:38,611
I mean, yes, I'm a little scared,
but I'm a new yorker.

144
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:40,511
I'm not gonna let this change me.

145
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:41,979
I've changed!

146
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,433
I'm a gun person now.

147
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,151
Clip! Yeah,
maybe we should just take

148
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:51,062
A break for a little bit...
I said, "clip."

149
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,761
You want to get a gun?
Not a scary one.

150
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,031
Just a cute, little,
pink beretta that matches

151
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,071
These adorable strappy
sandals I just bought.

152
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:02,032
By the way,
our new credit card works.

153
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,690
You don't need a gun.

154
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,374
Every statistic in the world
points to the fact that

155
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:09,381
It's safer not to have a gun
in the home than to have one,

156
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,111
Especially in our home.

157
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,581
You know how I'm always
accidentally injuring you.

158
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,212
Pretty easy, right?

159
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,201
Hurry up, baby.
The party's about to start.

160
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:33,102
Boo!

161
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,001
Oh, my God, Lily!

162
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:38,201
I thought you were
going as a sexy cat!

163
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:41,441
I changed my mind.

164
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,711
And now you want to bring
a gun into that equation?

165
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:47,085
I know, you're right,
but every time I close my eyes,

166
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,721
I picture that guy
pointing a gun at you.

167
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:52,206
And you're my whole world,
Marshall.

168
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,051
If something ever happened to you,
I would just...

169
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:55,321
I would just... Okay.

170
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:58,191
Okay... No, I know. I know.

171
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:00,261
Okay, look, I've got
to admit something.

172
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:04,108
That mugging didn't happen exactly
the way that I said it did.

173
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:07,631
Aha! So he was wearing a black,
skull-knit cap.

174
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:11,702
Told... Ja! No, he wasn't
wearing A black, skull-knit cap.

175
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:14,542
He wasn't wearing anything.

176
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:19,451
Wait, so... Watch it.

177
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:21,511
Don't get any closer.

178
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:24,081
It's... It's cool.

179
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:25,982
It's cool.

180
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,621
He naked-muggered you?

181
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:30,121
I'm not going to ask where
he was keeping the gun.

182
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:32,222
Are we sure it was a gun?

183
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,361
Okay, no, guys.

184
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:38,462
I was, I was walking home from work...
Through central park,

185
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:41,002
And I stopped at the zoo.

186
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:46,171
Watch it. Don't get any closer.

187
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:48,342
Oh, it's cool. It's cool.

188
00:07:54,882 --> 00:08:02,791
You're telling us... That you
got mugged... By a monkey.

189
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,781
I got mugged by a monkey.

190
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:16,749
You got mugged by a monkey?

191
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,787
Yep, I got mugged by a monkey.

192
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:21,243
I was embarrassed,
so I made up the other story.

193
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:23,460
But the point is, Lily,
you don't need a gun.

194
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,035
Oh, forget about the gun.
We're on this now.

195
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,325
Whoa, monkeys are
mugging people now?

196
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,778
It really is a jungle out there.

197
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,571
Oh, my God! That
monkey has our address.

198
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,801
What if he's in a gang?

199
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,461
I hope he doesn't do a swing-by.

200
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:40,530
Why didn't you just ask the
zookeeper to get your wallet back?

201
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:42,630
'cause I saw what the
monkey was doing with it,

202
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:44,301
And I didn't really
want it after that.

203
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,753
Hey, guys. What's up?

204
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:51,117
Oh, some new information has come
to light on Marshall's mugging.

205
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh, really? Did they catch the guy?

206
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:54,471
Well, he's behind bars.

207
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,140
Well, where did they find him?

208
00:08:57,141 --> 00:09:00,710
Oh, I'm guessing naked in a tree,
throwing his own feces.

209
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,150
Oh, I've seen that guy.

210
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:03,420
See, that's why I take cabs.

211
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,381
You know how they
caught him, right?

212
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:09,190
There was a tail on him.
There was a tail on him!

213
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:12,630
Okay... What is going on?

214
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,945
All right, Robin,
here's what happened.

215
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,161
No-no-no-no! Let me tell it.
It's my story.

216
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:22,171
You see, young Marshall Was
at the zoo eating a banana...

217
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,810
No, I wasn't eating a banana!

218
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:27,040
If you're gonna tell it,
tell it right.

219
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,021
Oh, you're right.

220
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,140
The banana was on the ground.

221
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,806
There was no...
There was no banana.

222
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:48,365
Marshall, I apologize... truly.

223
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,101
Robin, here's what happened.

224
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,370
Oh, God.

225
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,977
Oh, God, don't shoot.

226
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:57,440
There was no banana! Oh, come on.

227
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:00,910
Barney, I know, Marshall
didn't get mugged by a monkey.

228
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:03,410
Marshall?

229
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:05,341
That part he got right.

230
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:07,310
Guys!

231
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:09,680
This is not an
uncommon thing, okay?

232
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:12,950
In Thailand, in China,
in Costa Rica,

233
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,920
People get mugged by
monkeys all the time.

234
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:16,160
Monkeys are gatherers.

235
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:17,865
Because of their
intersocial dynamics,

236
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,290
Having a predisposition
towards stealing

237
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,061
Gives one a genetic advantage.

238
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:24,869
You were mugged by a monkey!

239
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:26,900
Maybe he was just curious.

240
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,601
Were you wearing a yellow hat?

241
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:32,004
Marshall, in all seriousness,
this is a great story.

242
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:33,670
I mean, can I interview
you about it on my show?

243
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,402
What?! He gets to be on your show?

244
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,710
What about my model?

245
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:39,410
No one wants to see a guy come
on my show and play with dolls.

246
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,711
Okay, first of all,
that is not what it is.

247
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:42,950
And second of all,

248
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:45,181
You just had a guy on your
show playing with dolls.

249
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,090
So, your dolls are favored to win

250
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,060
At the rhinebeck collector
awards next month.

251
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,120
Only if they behave themselves.

252
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,890
Last year, I found
one of them cavorting

253
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:55,230
With a g.I. Joe.

254
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,230
It's not funny.

255
00:10:57,231 --> 00:10:58,600
What were you thinking?

256
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:00,431
What if you'd gotten pregnant?

257
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,840
And you invited him back
for a follow-up interview.

258
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,770
Only because the FBI asked us

259
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:07,840
To keep him occupied while
they search his house.

260
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,361
Come on, Marshall. I need the story.
It's got everything.

261
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:16,301
Crime, monkeys, no stupid model
of the empire state building

262
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,761
That takes up my entire living room

263
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:19,851
And makes the whole
place smell like glue.

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,660
Come on. Do this for me...
As a friend?

265
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:26,247
It'd be fun to see you on tv. Yeah.

266
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:31,030
Okay... Can you promise
to present it in a way

267
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:32,951
That doesn't make a
joke out of the fact

268
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,422
That I got mugged by a monkey?

269
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,170
You got mugged by a monkey.

270
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:41,871
Oh, my God.

271
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:43,565
I just got mugged. What?

272
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,591
Is what I was saying to this
girl at the bar earlier...

273
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:49,380
It was completely terrifying.

274
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:50,914
I just want to forget

275
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:53,690
This ever happened and try
to move on with my life.

276
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:55,520
Oh, you poor thing.

277
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:56,920
Neil?

278
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:59,690
Neil. Neil. I... I... Neil!

279
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:03,460
Lady, my name's not Neil.
It's bar... Gah-gah!

280
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,961
Why are you calling him Neil?

281
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,500
Because that's his name.

282
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:07,930
He's Neil Armstrong.

283
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:10,070
The cyclist? I thought

284
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,901
You were supposed to be
on a shuttle mission?

285
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,740
I thought you just got mugged.

286
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:17,310
Okay, I can do this.

287
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:21,280
Uh, uh, you see,
I was on my way to the launch pad

288
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:24,121
When I was mugged.

289
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:29,051
And the mugger took
my space shuttle keys.

290
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:31,360
Nailed it.
Who's up for a three-way?

291
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,760
I am.

292
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:34,460
Me, too.

293
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,300
And it was the best three-way ever.

294
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,038
Strange, 'cause you look

295
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,330
Like you just had two vodka
tonics thrown in your face.

296
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,570
And you have lime in your hair.

297
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,001
I do?

298
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:47,929
The story's better with my ending.

299
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,530
Just... Okay?

300
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:53,710
So, there we are, zero gravity.

301
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:56,020
The three of us wearing
nothing but space helmets...

302
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,120
Marshall!

303
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:58,871
You won't believe it.

304
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,120
I pitched the monkey mugger story
To my producer and he loves it!

305
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:04,761
Oh... Wow. Yeah!

306
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,110
Really? Cool. Yeah!

307
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,161
I mean, who's ever heard of a
guy getting mugged by a monkey?

308
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:11,400
No one except for the
good people of Thailand,

309
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:14,300
China, Costa Rica,
and plenty of other countries

310
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:16,638
Where monkey crime is an
extremely common nuisance.

311
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:17,981
Well, the best part is,
he said that

312
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:19,556
It might get picked
up to go national.

313
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:23,202
Guys, this monkey mugger
story could make me famous.

314
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:26,704
Me, too.

315
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:30,336
Guys, this is bad.
I-I can't, I can't do this.

316
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,326
So, it'll be a little
embarrassing... so what?

317
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,860
It's not that. Guys...

318
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:39,139
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

319
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:45,458
So, you weren't mugged by a monkey?

320
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:46,600
No, I wasn't.

321
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,843
So what you're saying is

322
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:52,438
The monkey tricked you into
giving him your wallet?

323
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,710
No, that's not what I'm saying.

324
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,007
So you mugged the monkey?

325
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,105
Guys, there was no monkey!

326
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:59,521
It was a human being with a gun.

327
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:02,790
Are you sure it wasn't one monkey

328
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,923
Standing on another
monkey's shoulders,

329
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:06,420
Wearing a men's trench coat?

330
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,656
Be about the right height.

331
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,471
No! I... I just made that story up

332
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,737
So that Lily wouldn't get a gun.

333
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:13,067
The truth is that
it never happened.

334
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,646
I don't buy it. What?

335
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,168
You heard me. I think you
were mugged by a monkey.

336
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,900
You just don't want
to go on Robin's show

337
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,965
'cause you're afraid it'll make you

338
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,778
Look like a big joke.
Well, won't it?

339
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,940
The biggest, 'cause it's so funny.

340
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,305
Well, it never happened, okay?

341
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,730
And I can lie to you guys about
it because you're my best friends.

342
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,026
I am, but go on.

343
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:35,251
But I can't lie about
it on national tv.

344
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,290
Ted, you've known him the longest.

345
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,591
Is he telling the truth?

346
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,893
Ted, don't...

347
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:51,802
I can't tell.

348
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:55,208
He smells good.

349
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:58,301
But I just can't tell.

350
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:03,110
Well, I'm still saying it happened.

351
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,320
Maybe. But, Marshall,
if you didn't get mugged by a monkey,

352
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:09,320
You can't let Robin
report it on her show.

353
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:10,650
I mean, this could
hurt her credibility.

354
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:11,355
Oh, please! Journalists
lie all the time.

355
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,890
I'm sorry, but I will believe

356
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:17,955
That Jack Palance is
dead when I see the body.

357
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,100
Okay, this may come as
a shock to you, Barney,

358
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:21,730
But people don't
like to be lied to.

359
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:25,200
Wrong! They don't like finding
out they've been lied to.

360
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:27,400
"because a lie is
just a great story

361
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,140
That someone ruined
with the truth."

362
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:30,310
Barney Stinson.

363
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:34,040
Case in point, what that
girl Sarah did to me!

364
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,910
I think you mean
what you did to her.

365
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:38,550
No, I mean what she did to me.

366
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:41,520
The truth is, I'm afraid
the three-way story

367
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:43,690
Didn't go exactly the
way I said it did.

368
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,191
Nailed it.
Who's up for a three-way?

369
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:50,190
Lisa, wait.

370
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:52,091
Yes, Neil?

371
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:54,601
Oh, you're Lisa? Sarah, wait.

372
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:57,578
Look.

373
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,251
I'm not Neil Armstrong.

374
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,201
I'm sorry I lied.

375
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:06,710
Well, I guess I wasn't completely
honest with you, either.

376
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,980
I mean, I said that I was 28,

377
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:10,680
But the truth is
that I'm really 31.

378
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:13,020
And if we're being
completely honest,

379
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:17,491
I went to the doctor the other
day and found out... 31!

380
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,155
I was happy, very happy,

381
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:24,631
Thinking that I had nailed a
28-year-old with some sun damage.

382
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:27,230
People want the lie.

383
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:30,100
Marshall, they need the lie,
which is why,

384
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:32,900
As far as I'm concerned,
you were mugged by a monkey.

385
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:35,603
Just as sure as I
had that three-way.

386
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:39,180
I am the greatest in the world!

387
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,440
Bar... Barney!

388
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:42,710
Is that the three-way belt?

389
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,751
You know it. Props!

390
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,827
Man, I slept so great last night.

391
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,920
Can you believe I
almost bought a gun?

392
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,691
I'm so glad you got
mugged by a monkey.

393
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,200
Okay... You guys got me.

394
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,585
I was just nervous.

395
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:03,406
I, I got mugged by a monkey.

396
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,858
Yes! I knew it.

397
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:06,640
Wait a minute. Now I'm thinking

398
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,070
You really weren't
mugged by a monkey.

399
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,025
Come on, Ted. Why would he
make something like that up?

400
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:12,330
Yeah, come on, Ted.

401
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,441
Come here.

402
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,217
Okay, seriously,
what is that cologne?

403
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:24,388
It's intoxicating.

404
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,221
So, late the following night,

405
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,370
We all went to the
set of Robin's show.

406
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,930
Okay, Marshall, now,
don't be nervous.

407
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,123
What we're going to do is
we're going to sit you...

408
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,139
What the hell is this?

409
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:36,178
I don't know. Looks like
something covered by a sheet.

410
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:37,711
Guess if you want to find out,

411
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:39,419
You're going to have
to do a story on it.

412
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:40,951
You're going to be
covered by a sheet

413
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:43,070
If you don't get your
stupid model out of here.

414
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:45,621
Dude, what are you doing?

415
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:48,680
I don't think Marshall's
going to lie on tv.

416
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,431
And when he backs out,
I want to be there

417
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,211
For my friend, Robin, with a story.

418
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,922
Or rather, 102 stories,

419
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:58,958
Because that's how tall a certain
iconic New York landmark is.

420
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,326
Now, I want to buy a gun.

421
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,083
Whoa, the monkey's here.
Yeah, surprise.

422
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:05,344
We thought it would help the story

423
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:07,360
To bring him here so you
could face your attacker.

424
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,557
Yeah. Because of this incident,

425
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,525
We will be sending Captain
Bobo to a wildlife sanctuary.

426
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:14,540
Oh, I bet he'll like it there.

427
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,584
No, ma'am.

428
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,444
You see, we'll be splitting
him up from his mate, Milly.

429
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:21,241
They've been together
for a long time.

430
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,050
His mate's name is Milly?

431
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,372
And then, the interview began.

432
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:30,020
Marshall, in your own words,
Describe what happened.

433
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,451
Well, I would, I...

434
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,190
I would love to tell you
what happened, Robin.

435
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:38,230
But I'm just, I'm so curious

436
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:40,630
As to what is going on
underneath that sheet.

437
00:18:40,631 --> 00:18:42,298
Well, we're not here
to talk about that.

438
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,232
We're here to talk about
your mugging. Right.

439
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:46,348
Well, people get mugged in
New York City all the time,

440
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,051
Robin, but how often
do you get to see

441
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,638
Whatever's under that sheet?

442
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,715
Mike, can we get a shot of that?

443
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:53,680
We'll be right back. We're clear.

444
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:55,110
What the hell are you doing?

445
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,716
Robin, I... I wasn't really
mugged by a monkey, okay?

446
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,480
I just made up that story so
that Lily wouldn't buy a gun.

447
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,248
So you weren't mugged by a monkey?

448
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:03,284
No, what are you
talking about, baby?

449
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,701
Of course I was mugged by a monkey.

450
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:05,990
Great, tell it to America.

451
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:06,941
We're back in five.

452
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,006
No-no-no, not back in five.

453
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,069
I wasn't mugged by a monkey.

454
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,741
Okay, that's it.
I'm getting a gun. No-no-no!

455
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,630
Don't get a gun.
I was mugged by a monkey.

456
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,141
Well, then Bobo here is going away.

457
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:15,762
Wasn't! I wasn't
mugged by a monkey!

458
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:17,544
Ted, do you have any idea if
Marshall was mugged by a monkey?

459
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,413
None whatsoever.

460
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:21,501
Just tell me, were you or were
you not mugged by Captain Bobo?

461
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:23,421
Yeah, baby, just tell
us what really happened.

462
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,040
Yeah, Marshall,
just us tell the truth.

463
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,980
And that's when Marshall realized

464
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:32,820
There was only one
thing he could say.

465
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,027
All right!

466
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:36,290
Here's the truth.

467
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,091
I...

468
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,360
Am going back to bed.

469
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:43,990
And that was it.

470
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:46,882
We never found out what really
happened to Uncle Marshall's wallet.

471
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,502
But we do know this.

472
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:52,968
Aunt Lily never got a gun,
Robin's credibility remained unimpeached,

473
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,745
And Bobo and Milly lived
out their days together

474
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,340
In the Central Park Zoo.

475
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,940
Damn it.

476
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,505
All right, Ted, mic up.

477
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,050
Mic'd up and made up.

478
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:05,980
Red leather, yellow leather.

479
00:20:05,981 --> 00:20:08,320
Well, that wasn't very satisfying.

480
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:09,750
When I tell everyone
at work this story,

481
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm saying he was
mugged by a monkey.

482
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:12,841
And I'm going to keep the
banana on a string thing.

483
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:13,941
That was working.

484
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,990
Barney, enough with the lies.

485
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,511
You can't just tack on a new ending

486
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:19,560
Because you're not satisfied
with how a story wraps up.

487
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:22,061
Oh, really?

488
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,530
Well, mark my words, Mosby.

489
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:28,340
Someday you'll be telling this story,
you'll see it my way.

490
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,710
Doubtful.

491
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:31,932
And then, kids, you'll never
believe what happened.

492
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,211
The monkey got loose!

493
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,510
He's got one of my dolls!

494
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:38,908
Bobo, come here, Bobo.

495
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:40,556
Bobo... Whow whow whow...

496
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:42,791
He's climbing the building!

497
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:46,707
Bobo, come here.

498
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:49,591
I'll get him.

499
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:55,400
Is this really happening?

500
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,201
Sure is, Ted.
