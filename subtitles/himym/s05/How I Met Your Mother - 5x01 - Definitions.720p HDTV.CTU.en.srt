00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:10,325
<i>Kids, on my first day
as a college professor,</i>

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,054
<i>there were two things I didn't know
that I wish did.</i>

3
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,433
<i>The first thing was that your
mother was in that classroom.</i>

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,700
The second thing?

5
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,817
<i>Well, to explain that we have to go
back to the beginning of the summer,</i>

6
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:29,112
<i>when, after a year of wrestling
with their feelings for each other,</i>

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,480
<i>Barney and Robin finally, well...</i>

8
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,680
Volume. Use your indoor "whoo."

9
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:37,605
Sorry.

10
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:39,500
It's jt they kissed!

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,172
They're finally a couple.

12
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:42,500
Oh, my God, you guys!

13
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,668
This is our first double date!

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,919
First of millions!
What if our kids get married?!

15
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:49,144
I love this!

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,218
Lily, listen.

17
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:54,269
Barney's awesome.

18
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:56,789
Robin's more than just awe-"some."

19
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:58,534
She's awe-"quite a bit."

20
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,609
She's awe-"a whole darn lot."

21
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,562
Wait, what are you saying?

22
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:07,108
We're just not feeling it right now.
But we'll totally still be friends.

23
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:10,737
Is it something I did?

24
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,695
God, no.
Lily, it's not you. It's us.

25
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:17,493
It's us. You understand, right?

26
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,530
Sure, of course.

27
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,373
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

28
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:27,274
We were gonna take
cooking lessons together

29
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,089
and we were gonna go
on camping trips together

30
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,632
and then we were gonna sit around
telling funny stories

31
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:36,929
about our cooking lessons
and our camping trips.

32
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:38,748
I know.

33
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:45,316
So... has the boat sailed
on sex tonight or...

34
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,259
<i>After that, the summer
went by way too fast.</i>

35
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,838
<i>Until all of a sudden,
it was the Friday before</i>

36
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:54,718
<i>my first day as a college professor.</i>

37
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:56,991
What's this?

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,629
It's just a little something
that we got for you

39
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:03,623
that used to belong to my
favorite professor of all time.

40
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:08,169
A fedora.

41
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:14,744
I'm Indiana Jones!

42
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,975
That, my friend,
is the Dominator 8000,

43
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,641
the best bullwhip on the market,
according to my whip guy.

44
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,092
Yeah, I have a whip guy.

45
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,974
You know what we should do?
We should...

46
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,732
Finish our drinks,
go out in the alley, and whip stuff.

47
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,360
God... you just get me.

48
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:36,712
- I should get going. I got a date.
- You're still seeing that guy?

49
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,826
Even better, seeing him naked.
What!

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,339
I should go, too. I hooked up
with this Chinese girl last night,

51
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:46,243
and I don't know, it's weird.
I already feel like seconds.

52
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:51,174
You got first whip!

53
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:52,433
All right.

54
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:53,966
Hey, dummy.

55
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,494
What did tell you
about smoking in here?

56
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:59,659
Make him whip the habit!
I'so excited about this whip!

57
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:01,134
I got whip fever!

58
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,308
Just whip him, Ted!
Don't even aim! Just whip him!

59
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:06,847
- I'm so sorry.
- It's just the whip's not a toy.

60
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:09,313
There's such a thing
as common sense, you know.

61
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:12,838
- You can whip me if you want.
- I will, some other time.

{\pos(192,210)}So, how long has this been going on?

68
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:38,217
All summer.

69
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,845
I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

70
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,514
{\pos(192,230)}You guys are
boyfriend and girlfriend.

71
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:47,437
Girlfriend?

72
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,062
{\pos(192,210)}Slow your roll there, Lilypad.

73
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,690
You've been together all summer.
I dot get it.

74
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:57,403
{\pos(192,210)}It's like this. After we kissed,
we sat down to have the talk.

75
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,357
{\pos(192,180)}We should figure out what this is.

76
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,732
Yes, we should.

77
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:02,909
Or.

78
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:04,487
Or...

79
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:09,441
{\pos(192,205)}Okay, now,
we have to figure this out.

80
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:10,899
{\pos(192,205)}Yes, we do.

81
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:12,752
Or. Or...

82
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,594
{\pos(192,210)}We kept trying to have the talk
and then we realized we hate the talk.

83
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,262
Yeah, the talk sucks.

84
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,130
{\pos(192,210)}You have to, like, talk.

85
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:28,885
{\pos(192,210)}And be all, "I don't know.
It's not that I don't like you.

86
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,663
{\pos(192,210)}"It's just that I haven't had
a girlfriend in a really long time.

87
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,531
{\pos(192,210)}I hope it doesn't make you mad."

88
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:35,650
- Who needs it?
- You needs it.

89
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,208
{\pos(192,210)}Guys, you can't just keep hooking up

90
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,947
{\pos(192,210)}and not at least try and figure out
what you mean to each other.

91
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,298
{\pos(192,210)}We knew you would say that.
That's why we kept it a secret.

92
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:48,073
{\pos(192,210)}Well, that and the fact
that elaborate lies really turn us on.

93
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:54,005
{\pos(192,210)}You need tdefine the relationship.
You ne to have the talk.

94
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,930
{\pos(192,210)}Or.

95
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,329
{\pos(192,210)}Or...

96
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,801
I know what you're all thinking.

97
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:05,429
{\pos(192,185)}"Who's this cool
peer of mine up in front the class?"

98
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:09,431
{\pos(192,210)}I know the board says
"Professor Mosby," but to you

99
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:11,532
I'm Ted.

100
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,363
Question. Awesome. Hit it.

101
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:20,861
Here's my question, "Ted,"
who the hell do you think you are?

102
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,284
We're supposed to learn from you?
You failed as an architect.

103
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:29,704
And if you're a professor,
where's your hat and your whip?

104
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,498
- They're at home. I...
- And where are your pants?

105
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:38,749
Oh, God.

106
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,328
It was awful. I was teaching...

107
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,594
Ted, now's not a good time.
Where do you keep your condoms?

108
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,347
I am freaking out.
I don't think I can do this.

109
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:52,444
Okay, look, mistake number 1
was taking that girl's question.

110
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:55,563
You don't take questions
on the first day. It shows weakness.

111
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,191
Mistake number 2
was you should've hit that.

112
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,198
Dude, your pants were already off,
you had a classroom full of people

113
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:05,245
to cheer you on, and you can't
knock her up 'cause it's a dream.

114
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,657
Class dismissed.

115
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,873
Mistake N3, dude, where was the hat?

116
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:11,370
Cause if you're not going
to wear it, I'm taking it back.

117
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:15,031
I think what Barney's saying
is that definitions are important.

118
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:16,959
You're their teacher,
not their friend.

119
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,085
Exactly.

120
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,713
If people don't know their place,
nobody's happy.

121
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:21,784
Amen.

122
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:24,884
- You have to make things clear.
- Run tell that.

123
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,094
Define the relationship.

124
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,719
Yes! No!

125
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,389
Lily, private convo time.

126
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,187
Can't you just let us be happy?

127
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,530
You're notappy.

128
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,066
You just think you're happy
because you feel happy.

129
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:42,985
- And that's not happy
- Of course not.

130
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,112
You and Robin need to have the talk.

131
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,989
Why? Give me one good reason.

132
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,738
- I'll give you 20...
- You can't even think of one.

133
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:50,993
Headlights. Deer.

134
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,412
Lily, for the last time,

135
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,180
things with me and Robin are
as good as they can possibly be.

136
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,810
Look, Brad's here.

137
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,296
I've got two tickets to the
Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night.

138
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,799
I know you're a hockey fan,
so I was tnking...

139
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,304
What do I have to do?
Put a gun to your head?

140
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:15,208
- Buy you a six pack?
- Come on, Brad, that's...

141
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,894
There's really six of them.

142
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:21,357
- But, I can't.
- Why not? You have a boyfriend?

143
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,610
No. No, no boyfriend.

144
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,228
Great! It's a date.

145
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,702
I just thought of a reason.

146
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:43,379
<i>The next night, Robin and Brad
went to a hockey game.</i>

147
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,591
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet all night.

148
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:51,166
{\pos(192,210)}Damn it, Hordichuk!
You miss another gimme like that,

149
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,091
I'm gonna come down there and
put a slapper right up your beerhole!

150
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,016
Come on!

151
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:56,726
{\pos(192,210)}Not really.

152
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,813
{\pos(192,210)}The truth is, I feel
kind of weird being out with you.

153
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:02,116
{\pos(192,210)}Oh, man.

154
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,681
{\pos(192,210)}- Is this the talk?
- What?

155
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:07,153
{\pos(192,210)}No, this is good.
Let's get it all out of the way.

156
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,614
Robin, I'm looking
for something serious.

157
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,324
No, Brad, no, it's...

158
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,882
But before we go any further,

159
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:15,561
you should know something
about my stuff below the belt.

160
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,330
I was born a little different.

161
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:18,694
God, no...

162
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,897
Brad, no...

163
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,252
- This is about me and Barney.
- You and Barn...

164
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:27,322
- So you guys are...
- Well, we don't know what we are.

165
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:31,260
I mean, my heart says "leap into it."
My brain says "it's a bad idea."

166
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,262
Sounds like you guys
need to have the talk.

167
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,097
We're not gonna have the talk!

168
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,995
Would you just have the talk, okay?
It's a five-minute conversation,

169
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,217
and then you get
to have sex afterwards.

170
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:42,897
It's great! Back me up, Ted.

171
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,900
- I don't think the talk is necessary.
- What?!

172
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,235
Thank you, Ted.

173
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,570
Because Robin is already
his girlfriend.

174
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:50,729
What?!

175
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,449
MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...

176
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:56,369
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend?

177
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,538
Simple, the rules for girls are
the same as the rules for gremlins.

178
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,667
- "Gremlins"?
- Gremlins. Rule number 1.

179
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,465
Never get them wet.

180
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,035
{\pos(192,210)}In otherords, don't let her
take a shower at your place.

181
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,203
Number 2.
Keep them away from sunlight.

182
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:12,184
{\pos(192,210)}i.e. Don't ever see them
during the day.

183
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,179
And rule number 3,
never feed them after midnight.

184
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,697
{\pos(192,210)}Meaning she doesn't sleep over
and you don't have breakfast with her

185
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,725
ever.

186
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,103
What about brunch?
Is brunch cool?

187
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:26,137
No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.

188
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,385
New topic. How do I pick a tie?

189
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:32,822
<i>Simple. Remember
in the movie Predator...</i>

190
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:36,374
I've done all three
of those things with Robin.

191
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:38,577
Is she my girlfriend?

192
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,916
Just once, I wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.

193
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,984
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
time to pucker up</i>

194
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:50,491
<i>for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!</i>

195
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,286
Okay, how about this?
If you kiss me,

196
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:59,393
and you feel bad about it,
you're meant to be with Barney.

197
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,118
Why not? Lay it on me.

198
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,876
Brad, we can't fight
like this all night!

199
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,773
We both got some good shots in.
Let's call a truce!

200
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,191
It's okay, dude.

201
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:20,286
I shouldn't go kissing
some other guy's girlfriend.

202
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:21,972
Girlfriend?

203
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:24,419
- Hey, come on.
- That's putting it a bit strongly.

204
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:26,381
A bit strongly.
She's not my girlfriend.

205
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,604
A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?

206
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,254
Okay, seriously.

207
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,973
We're at the point
of physical violence.

208
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,539
Now, will you please have the talk?

209
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,967
Because of that?

210
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:39,761
Come on. That's my thing.

211
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:41,636
I'm always punching guys.

212
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:44,310
Girls... I'll punch a baby.
I don't care.

213
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,689
<i>Finally, my first class had arrived.</i>

214
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,146
<i>For real this time.</i>

215
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,246
<i>I knew I had to make
a strong impression.</i>

216
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:54,543
<i>I had thought of everything.
Except...</i>

217
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:57,361
<i>Wait. Does professor
have one "F" or two?</i>

218
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:59,344
<i>Oh, my God...
Oh, my God!</i>

219
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:00,469
<i>Professor.</i>

220
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:03,704
<i>Pro-fess-or.
They're all staring at me.</i>

221
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,196
<i>Professor.
I don't know.</i>

222
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,721
<i>Just do something!</i>

223
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:10,156
<i>Two "F's".</i>

224
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,130
<i>That looks right.
I think that's right.</i>

225
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,940
Hey, sorry I went little
too far last night.

226
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,293
We've been over this.
Unless I say "flugelhorn"

227
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:34,837
you haven't gone too far.

228
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,488
No, I meant punching Brad.

229
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,754
Right. Look,
don't even worry about it. It's...

230
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,750
God.

231
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,480
The doorknob's broken off.

232
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:45,871
We're locked in here.
Did, did you do this?

233
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,916
Flugelhorn. Did you do this?

234
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:56,382
- Ted, are you out there?
- Ted's not here, Robin.

235
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,649
- Lily, let us out of here.
- I'd be glad to.

236
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,428
Just as soon as you
and Barney have the talk.

237
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,311
Lily! Come on. Let us out!

238
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,938
No. Sit down,

239
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:15,233
{\pos(192,210)}define the relationship, write down
that definition on a piece of paper,

240
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:16,985
{\pos(192,210)}slip it under the door,

241
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,113
{\pos(192,210)}and if I like what I read,
you can go.

242
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,282
{\pos(192,210)}- We are not having the talk!
- Then you'll die in there.

243
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,655
{\pos(192,210)}You're gonna lock us in here?
Well, guess what?

244
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,480
Maybe we'll spend
the whole day having sex!

245
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,168
Well, guess what?

246
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:32,167
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.

247
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:33,856
Hey, guys.

248
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:38,799
<i>I still hadn't decided what kind of
professor I wanted to be...</i>

249
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,312
<i>authoritative or cool guy.</i>

250
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:44,648
<i>I thought I would decide
in the moment. And I did.</i>

251
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:45,934
<i>About 20 times.</i>

252
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,209
Good morning.

253
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:49,231
'Sup, dudes?

254
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,500
Silence!

255
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:56,321
This is Architecture 101.
I am Professor Mosby.

256
00:12:57,813 --> 00:12:59,513
But you can call me Ted.

257
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,791
Professor Mosby.

258
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,270
T-Dawg.

259
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,760
Do not call me T-Dawg.

260
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:13,667
Never take questions on the first day.
It shows weakness.

261
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,255
Also, don't look

262
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:17,897
right here.

263
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:21,611
Okay, good luck. Byesies.

264
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:25,554
<i>This was it, my crossroads moment.</i>

265
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,585
<i>What kind of professor
was I gonna be</i>

266
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,010
<i>I had to decide.</i>

267
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,971
Please save all your questions
until the end of the lecture.

268
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,096
Thank you!

269
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:35,799
Now...

270
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,853
<i>Professor Mosby had arrived.</i>

271
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:40,275
<i>Of course, if I had taken
that girl's question...</i>

272
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,302
<i>who, by the way, was not your mom.</i>

273
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:43,870
<i>Your mom was sitting...</i>

274
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:45,809
<i>Wait, let me finish this real quick.</i>

275
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:47,701
<i>Here's what
that girl would have said.</i>

276
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:51,070
I'm sorry to bother you,
Professor Mosby, but this

277
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,845
isn't Architecture 101.

278
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,977
This is Economics 305.

279
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:56,752
You're in the wrong classroom.

280
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,534
<i>Yes, I was in the wrong classroom.</i>

281
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:02,809
<i>And thus began the most humiliating
seven minutes of my life.</i>

282
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,873
Here's your think-about-it
for the day.

283
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:07,334
Every single person in this room...

284
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,556
is already an architect.

285
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,724
Architect?

286
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:19,404
"We're just hanging out."

287
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,956
Just hanging out?

288
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:23,403
Not good enough.

289
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,738
Not good enough!

290
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:28,141
Can anyone here

291
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,200
tell me

292
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:32,371
what this class is really all about?

293
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:33,864
Economics?

294
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,034
Don't laugh. He's not...

295
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,859
He's not entirely wrong.

296
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,286
An architect must be economical

297
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000
in his use of space,

298
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:45,491
so...

299
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:47,193
well done.

300
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:49,049
Looks like someone's

301
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:50,251
building

302
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,993
towards an A.

303
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,547
"We're seeing
where things are going."

304
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,914
I'll tell you where things
aren't doing...

305
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:02,545
out of that bedroom.

306
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,945
- Not good enough.
- Not good enough!

307
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:08,461
You...

308
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,972
Why do you want to be an architect?

309
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:13,120
I don't want to be an architect.

310
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:18,093
Yes, exactly.
It's not something you want to be.

311
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,960
It's something you need to be.

312
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,106
You don't have a choice, right?
None of you has a choice

313
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:25,679
No questions!

314
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,223
"We're Barnman and Robin."

315
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,792
Come on, you got to admit,
that's kind of fun, Lily.

316
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:35,717
Not...

317
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:37,144
good enough.

318
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,765
Not good enough!

319
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:41,398
So if any of you

320
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,816
have even the slightest inclination

321
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,987
to do anything with your life
other than become an archite,

322
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,508
you're wasting my time and yours.

323
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,492
There's the door... You can go.

324
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,954
I'm serious. Get out, now.

325
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,878
Wait...
Don't... all leave!

326
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:05,776
Architecture's fun! Look!
I brought a hacky sack!

327
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,215
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

328
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:10,786
My name is Professor Calzonetti.
This is Economics 305.

329
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:12,861
You may return to your seats.

330
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,642
Sorry, sir.
This is... Architecture 101.

331
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:19,461
Who invited their dad, right?

332
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,818
Young man, for the last 28 years,

333
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:24,417
Economics 305
has been taught right here

334
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,693
in building 14, room 7.

335
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:30,496
Buddy, I'm sure
200 architecture students

336
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:32,751
and their professor
all got the room wrong.

337
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:35,077
T-Dawg,
you're in the wrong room, bro.

338
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:41,447
Kids, out of my way!

339
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:43,502
Sorry. Coming through.

340
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,750
Excuse me. Coming through.

341
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,307
20 minutes late on your first day?

342
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,394
- That's rough.
- But here's the funny thing.

343
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:03,263
<i>By that point,
I didn't have time to think about</i>

344
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:06,325
<i>what kind of teacher I was
going to be. I just got up there and</i>

345
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,943
<i>talked about architecture.</i>

346
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:11,029
- And it was kind of great.
- That's awesome, Ted.

347
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,031
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Thanks.

348
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,699
<i>- Nice job, Ted.
- Hey, Ted, door five!</i>

349
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,620
<i>- Were you there?
- I got you, buddy.</i>

350
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,552
They still haven't had the talk?

351
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,316
I think I know
how to speed things up

352
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,507
Not cool!

353
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:33,866
Pancakes,

354
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:35,512
fresh bacon.

355
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:37,276
It is so yummy.

356
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:41,101
Dude, I'm starving. Let's...

357
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,936
Let's just have the stupid talk.

358
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,312
- Come on.
- Fine.

359
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:48,608
But how do these things even work?
What do we say?

360
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,507
<i>Where do you see
this relationship going?</i>

361
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,118
My God, that sounds so cheesy.

362
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,186
- I know, right?
- Totally.

363
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:04,706
But... Where do you see
this relationship going?

364
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,627
I don't know.

365
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,540
I mean,
it's not like I don't like you.

366
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:13,330
I just haven't had a girlfriend
for a long time.

367
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:16,464
- I hope that doesn't make you mad.
- Mad?

368
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:19,097
I feel the same way.
I suck at relationships.

369
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,200
I mean, except with Ted.

370
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:23,870
He really got it right.

371
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:25,895
I know it's a cliché, but...

372
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,357
he really ruined me for other men.

373
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,815
<i>Of course, I wasn't in the room
for this conversation,</i>

374
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,428
<i>but I have to imagine
Robin said something like that.</i>

375
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,656
Maybe we should go back
to being just friends.

376
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:37,991
Maybe.

377
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:40,388
But...

378
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,757
I don't want to stop having sex.

379
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:44,282
Good. Me, neither.

380
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:47,777
Friends isn't gonna work.

381
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,407
We're not good at being friends.

382
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:52,117
We're not good at being in a
relationship. What are we good at?

383
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:54,359
- I know something we're good at.
- I don't know.

384
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:57,021
If we're gonna do it again,
I'm gonna need some Gatorade...

385
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,110
Not that.

386
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:00,005
Lying. Think about it.

387
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,385
We spent the whole summer lying
about being just friends. Why not just

388
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,601
keep lying?

389
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:12,812
Really?

390
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,366
Really. We sat down.
We had the talk.

391
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:19,497
- Barney's my boyfriend now.
- And Robin's my girlfriend.

392
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:22,386
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.

393
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,792
We're both
afraid of commitment but...

394
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,368
the fact is, we also
can't live without each other.

395
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,634
And if the alternative
is not being together,

396
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,125
then it's worth taking
this risk 'cause...

397
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:34,294
she's awesome.

398
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,091
And he's awesome.

399
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,748
He looks nice in a suit.

400
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,554
She can handle her Scotch.

401
00:19:41,095 --> 00:19:42,222
He's my boyfriend.

402
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:44,224
And she's my girlfriend.

403
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,042
Good enough!

404
00:19:57,548 --> 00:19:58,615
She bought it.

405
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,090
Hook, line, and sinker.
We are good.

406
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,325
Totally.

407
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,739
So, you want to get some breakfast?

408
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:07,205
You know, brunch actually
does sound kind of good.

409
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,083
Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.

410
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,174
- Flugelhorn?
- Yeah, that felt wrong.

411
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,162
You do realize
they were lying, right?

412
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:31,063
They don't realize
they weren't lying.

413
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,350
Hello.

414
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:46,236
Hello. Good evening.

415
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:47,766
Hello. Don't get up.

416
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:49,571
Didn't we meet on a yacht?

417
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,624
Hello.

418
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:54,292
What?

419
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:59,132
Did I not tell you guys
that it was Tuxedo Night?

420
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:01,671
Doesn't feel very good, does it?

421
