1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:01,533
<i>Kids, your uncle Barney had been called</i>

2
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:03,234
<i>a lot of names over the years.</i>

3
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:05,101
Jerk!

4
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:07,101
Bastard!

5
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:08,834
Barack Obama Jr.?!

6
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,500
Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,101
And yes... we can.

8
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:14,301
<i>But there's one name none of us</i>

9
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:15,900
<i>ever expected
to hear him called.</i>

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,167
Boyfriend.
Barney Stinson is my boyfriend.

11
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,800
I've said it, like,
a hundred times

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,900
it still sounds
weird to say.

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,800
Well, anything sounds weird
if you say it a hundred times.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,201
Bowl.

15
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,667
Bowl.

16
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:31,468
Bowl.

17
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:33,500
But other than that, things are good?
Bowl.

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,934
Bowl.
I don't know.

19
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,001
I think Barney's been single for too long.
Bowl.

20
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,301
Like, the other night, I wake up at 4:00 a.m.--
Bowl.

21
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,934
(thud, Robin gasps)

22
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,101
Barney, are you awake?

23
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:46,767
Barney?

24
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,600
Barney.

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,368
This is not
a one-night stand.

26
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:52,134
We're dating.
Come back to bed.

27
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,700
Bowl.
That's happened three times.

28
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,900
Bowl.
And it's not just that, it's other things.

29
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,167
Hey. What's wrong?

30
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,368
(heavy sigh)
It was just one thing after another

31
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,267
at work today,
and then... (sniffling)

32
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,201
I found out my aunt's
in the hospital.

33
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,667
I'm just, I'm feeling
so overwhelmed and it's just...

34
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,867
Shh, shh, shh.

35
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,001
What you need to do is talk
through this stuff.

36
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,500
Oh,  thanks.

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
And then, once you're
off the phone with Lily,

38
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,201
I'll be down in the bar
ready to have sex.

39
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:24,767
Mm-kay?

40
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,034
Bowl.

41
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:29,401
Look, I'm not
the touchy-feely-est

42
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:31,034
person in the world, but...

43
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,734
a little more effort
would be nice.

44
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,201
Bowl. Bowl.
I understand.

45
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:36,967
Bowl.
I guess, in a lot of ways,
Barney doesn't stack up.

46
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,834
Bowl. Bowl.
I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends.

47
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:43,900
(at various pitches):
Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.

48
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,867
No, that's not it.
Bowl.

49
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:46,967
I don't know.

50
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,067
Maybe he just
doesn't have it in him.

51
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,468
(continues saying
"bowl")

52
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:52,301
Maybe is whole thing's
a big mistake.

53
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,468
Bowl?

54
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:55,633
She really said that?

55
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:57,001
And she meant it.

56
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,167
Trust me. I dated

57
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,434
Robin for a year-- if you
don't want to lose her,

58
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:01,700
you gotta try
a little harder.

59
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,667
Be more attentive

60
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,533
to where she is emotionally.

61
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,434
You know, just be present.

62
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:08,034
Yes, totally.
Yeah.

63
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:09,567
Only thing,
and this is just me--

64
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:10,800
Mm-hmm.

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,500
I like my testicles
attached to my body,

66
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,734
rather than rolling around

67
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,234
next to some eyeliner
in Robin's purse.

68
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,234
Stinson out!

69
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:19,700
<i>But then
a funny thing happened.</i>

70
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,201
<i>Over the next couple weeks,
Barney was thoughtful,</i>

71
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,834
<i>considerate...</i>

72
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,134
<i>sweet.</i>

73
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,934
<i>In short,
the perfect boyfriend.</i>

74
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,834
<i>Which, to Robin,
meant only one thing.</i>

75
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,600
He's cheating on me.
What?!

76
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,967
Why else would
he buy me flowers?

77
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,401
He's gettin' some
on the side.

78
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,700
Oh, come on, Robin.

79
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,967
Barney's not the type of guy
who would... Go on.

80
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,167
Plus, he keeps saying
he's working late.

81
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,667
But when I call his office,
they say he left hours ago.

82
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,034
Well, that doesn't
prove anything.

83
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:45,368
Yes. Proof. Go word.

84
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:47,034
I'm glad you
brought that up.

85
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,067
Barney's briefcase.

86
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,468
He forgot it
here this morning.

87
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:52,633
And what do you plan
on doing with it?

88
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,900
We, we-- you and I--

89
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,533
are going to open it up
and look for evidence.

90
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,267
Ted probably has a sledgehammer
around here somewhere.

91
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:00,368
No! Stop!

92
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:02,134
Stop! Eye contact.

93
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,368
Listen to me.

94
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:05,533
Robin Scherbatsky
is many things:

95
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,134
friend, confidant,

96
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:09,368
occasional guest star
in some confusing dreams

97
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,867
that remind me a woman's
sexuality is a moving target.

98
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:15,533
But she is no crazy,
jealous stalker-bitch.

99
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,301
Let go.

100
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,567
Hey, I've been down
in the basement

101
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,101
storage area going through
all the stuff that

102
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,500
Lily and I left behind when
we moved out. I'm  Robin.

103
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,101
We should've cleared it out
for you much sooner.

104
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:26,533
There's a basement storage area?

105
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:27,767
Oh, you're not upset.
Good.

106
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,334
Baby,
guess what I found.

107
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,434
Oh, that's great, honey.

108
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:39,500
What the hell is that?

109
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,167
Marshall got it in college.

110
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,934
He used it as a
nightstand for years.

111
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:47,368
Until we found out that Lily
was allergic to barrel resin

112
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,700
Barrel resin?
Just go with it.

113
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,667
So you need a hand
throwing it out?

114
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,034
No, I'm not...

115
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,267
I'm not just going
to throw her out, okay?

116
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,034
Mabel's like family.

117
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:59,334
So, um, what are you going
to do with Mabel?

118
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:01,800
I want to give her away,
um, to a lucky new owner.

119
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,834
Do you know anyone?

120
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah, hmm, let me think.

121
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,734
Do I know any rodeo clowns?

122
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:08,734
Oh, that's weird, I do.

123
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,567
But even Lenny wouldn't
go near that mess.

124
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,567
Well, he's not going
to have the chance,

125
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,001
because I am putting old Mabel

126
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,734
in the Bermuda Triangle.

127
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,301
<i>"The Bermuda Triangle"
was the name we'd given</i>

128
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,067
<i>years earlier to the curb right
in front of our building.</i>

129
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,434
<i>Whenever we wanted
to give something away,</i>

130
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:27,001
<i>we'd put it right there.</i>

131
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,734
<i>It was uncanny.</i>

132
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,734
This is so exciting.

133
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,700
Right now there's some
out there who has no idea

134
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,067
that tonight they're
going home with just...

135
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,767
just the best barrel.

136
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,368
Well, let's just hope
they're not allergic

137
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,134
to barrel sin
like Lily here.

138
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:47,834
Be cool, baby. Damn!

139
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,067
See you, sweetie.
Good luck.

140
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,001
Bye, babe.

141
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,734
(sighing)
Now, can we please

142
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,301
get out of here?
Yeah. I'll grab my coat.

143
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,600
Oops.

144
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,934
A college notebook?!

145
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,934
Oh, my God,
he's cheating on me

146
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,001
with some college girl.

147
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,134
I knew there was a skank

148
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:09,034
but I thought
she'd at least be dumb.

149
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,734
"Birthday: July 23.

150
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,700
"Favorite hockey team:
the Vancouver Canucks.

151
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,533
Age: 29, but tells
people that she's 26."

152
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,001
Oh, my God,
these are notes

153
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,134
about me.

154
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,633
Or some 29-year-old
version of me.

155
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,401
I hope I'm not too late!

156
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:28,301
I want to see the look of joy
on the new owner's face!

157
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:35,401
She's still there!

158
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,667
Okay Mabel, let's find
you a new home.

159
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,401
Here comes a guy!

160
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,767
And he... he just walked,
walked right on by it.

161
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:47,633
He's probably rushing home to
get a handcart or something.

162
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,301
Yeah!
Hey, better hurry up, pal.

163
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,600
(chuckles)

164
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,633
What are you guys doing

165
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,134
with Barney's
secret Robin notebook?

166
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,334
Let me rephrase that.

167
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:02,267
Did you two ladies
lose some weight?

168
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,167
What do you know
about this, Marshall?

169
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,234
Why would Barney

170
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,500
have a notebook full
of information about me?

171
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,234
Well...

172
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,567
<i>The truth was...</i>

173
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,734
<i>Barney was taking a
night school class taught...</i>

174
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:15,234
<i>by me.</i>

175
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,201
Welcome to Robin 101.

176
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:24,134
<font color="#ffff00">Sync and correction by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

177
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,234
Why is Ted teaching
a class about me?

178
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:39,900
It all started
a few weeks ago.

179
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,101
...rather than rolling around

180
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,867
next to some eyeliner
in Robin's purse.

181
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,234
Stinson out!

182
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,700
Stinson back in.

183
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,201
Say, hypothetically,
did want to change who I am

184
00:06:56,201 --> 00:07:00,134
to become a better boyfriend
to Robin, which I do not!

185
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:03,201
What kind of changes
are we talking about?

186
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,734
Why, I mean,
there's just so much

187
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,167
you need to know about her.

188
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:07,368
Okay, for starters,

189
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:11,267
don't ever cry in front  her.

190
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:13,101
Okay.

191
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,600
And whatever you do,

192
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,767
don't cry in front of her
four times.

193
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,301
ROBIN:
Hey, guys.

194
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,633
What you talking about?

195
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,267
Fantasy football.
Fantasy football.

196
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,368
They realized
they couldn't talk about

197
00:07:25,368 --> 00:07:26,734
this stuff
at the bar, and

198
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,401
since you live with Ted,

199
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,767
they had to find someplace safe.

200
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,234
So... Ted's classroom.

201
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,667
"How To Date Robin Scherbatsky."

202
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,900
Lesson one.

203
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,167
Now, even though she puts up
a tough exterior,

204
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,468
what Robin really wants,
deep down...

205
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm bored.

206
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,101
You said you wanted my help.

207
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,401
Can we draw boobs
on the chalkboard?

208
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:46,500
We did that ready.

209
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
No, like, really big boobs.

210
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,800
No. Look, I need this, too.

211
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
I've only been
a professor a few weeks.

212
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,633
Being up here, it's,
it's good practice for me.

213
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,800
Can we have class outside?

214
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
No! What Robin really
wants deep down...

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,334
(cell phone chimes)

216
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,867
Barney!
What?

217
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm tweeting about you.

218
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,734
You should be flattered.

219
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,734
How do you spell
blah-blah-blah-- "H's" or no?

220
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:10,700
Wow, you were just,

221
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,667
like, the worst student
in the world, weren't you?

222
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,567
They said I had
A-D... something.

223
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,434
Can we have class outside?

224
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:19,434
Barney, I'm only gonna
say this once,

225
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,401
so listen up.

226
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,234
I love you and I love Robin.

227
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:25,767
And I want to make this work.

228
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,900
So if you give me
a few weeks of attention,

229
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,434
I could give you
a lifetime of happiness.

230
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:32,001
Can you do that for me?

231
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,900
<i>Do you think I should get
Sports Illustrated</i>

232
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,201
for 70% off the cover price?

233
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,434
Can we have class outside?

234
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,368
I got to find a way
to reach this kid.

235
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,334
"Class number two."

236
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,101
"Top Ten Robin Scherbatsky

237
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,834
Facial Expressions
And Their Meaning."

238
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,034
Now, notice the vacant eyes,

239
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,934
the pale, queasy expression,
suggesting nausea.

240
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:53,967
What do these mean?

241
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,834
You guys just had sex?
Oh!

242
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,834
Wasn't me.

243
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,700
Dude! I worked really hard
on these slides, okay?

244
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,533
Can we just...
Okay.

245
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,533
This look is hunger.

246
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,401
If you ever see Robin
looking like this,

247
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,900
get some food in her quick,

248
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,334
Or one of two things
will happen.

249
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:14,500
One: weird, out-of-context
laughter

250
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:19,600
Or two: spontaneously falling
to sleep in strange places.

251
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:25,700
But the most important facial
expression of all?

252
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,800
That's a building.

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,567
Oh... (chuckles)

254
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,034
That's for my class.

255
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:33,700
The Flatiron Building.

256
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,101
Fun story about it.

257
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:37,067
It was designed by Chicago's
Daniel Burnham

258
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:40,633
in the beaux arts style;
this architectural gem

259
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:41,867
Right.

260
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:45,067
The most important facial
expression of all.

261
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,667
Whoa...

262
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,567
Flared nostril ridges.

263
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,900
Wide, unblinking eyes.

264
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,101
If you ever,

265
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:01,500
<i>ever see this
face, Barney,</i>

266
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,234
run.

267
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,934
<i>And don't take
a picture of it.</i>

268
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,934
She will punch you.

269
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,734
And you will cry...

270
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,167
for the third time...

271
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:19,267
that night.

272
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:22,401
Which brings us
to an important point:

273
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:24,401
defusing the bomb.

274
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:26,700
"Defusing the bomb"?

275
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,167
What does that even mean?

276
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,900
"Three Topics
To Distract Robin

277
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,134
From Being Mad At You."

278
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:33,401
"Distract" me? Oh, that
is so condescending.

279
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,267
These guys are really
starting to piss me off!

280
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,201
"Immediately switch the conversation 
To one of the following,

281
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,034
"unless you want

282
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:42,434
Robin to start
throwing her shoes."

283
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:44,900
One.

284
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,334
"Vancouver Canucks
2004 Division Title."

285
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,267
What?!

286
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:50,500
That's not distracting.

287
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,034
That's just talking
about the story

288
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:53,533
Of a scrappy little
underdog team

289
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,934
that prevailed despite
very shaky goal ending

290
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,600
and, frankly, the declining
skills of Trevor Linden.

291
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,401
Two: "Proper Gun Cleaning
and Maintenance."

292
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:07,234
You have to clean your gun

293
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,334
My uncle had
a filthy old shotgun,

294
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,134
blew both his thumbs off
trying to shoot a beaver.

295
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:12,900
You want to distract someone,

296
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,468
make them watch my uncle
try to eat corn on the cob.

297
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,134
Three: "Emperor Penguins."

298
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,167
Did you know
that before intercourse,

299
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,767
the male and female emperor
penguins bow to each other?

300
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,101
Mr. Penguin.

301
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,267
Mrs. Penguin.

302
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:33,301
Oh, God, silly penguins,
acting all fancy.

303
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,134
(both laughing)

304
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,700
What were we talking about?

305
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,834
MARSHALL: Uh-oh.
Looks like we got a taker.

306
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, come on, dude.

307
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,034
You know you want to

308
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:45,401
A guy like you,
beard, no mustache.

309
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:48,600
You're exactly the kind of guy
who could use a sweet barrel.

310
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,134
Do it.

311
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:53,734
No. No.
That's not a fire hydrant!

312
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,767
What...
For shame, Sir. For shame!

313
00:11:56,767 --> 00:12:00,867
I bet you couldn't even grow
a mustache if you wanted to.

314
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,167
Neither can you, sweetie.

315
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,067
Well, he doesn't
know that, baby! God!

316
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:08,434
Ted's only teaching Barney
horrible things about me.

317
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:11,167
I don't know.
Check this out.

318
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,700
This is actually
kind of sweet.

319
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,434
Now, we all know
Robin's not

320
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,267
what you'd call
"touchy-feely."

321
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:20,967
She doesn't say, "I love
you," like a normal person.

322
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:22,567
Instead, she'll laugh,
shake her head,

323
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:27,234
give you a little smile
and say, "You're an idiot."

324
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,867
"You're an idiot"?

325
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,334
Yup.

326
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,600
If she tells you you're an
idiot, you're a lucky man.

327
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,633
And if she does say

328
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:34,934
"I love you,"

329
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:37,201
she's already broken up
with you in her mind.

330
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:40,434
I think 's nice
that Ted knows you that well.

331
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,434
Ah, well, too bad it's
next to a page entitled...

332
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:46,001
"Robin Scherbatsky's
Surprising Erogenous Zones."

333
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:50,334
Right knee-- ticklish.

334
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,267
Left knee...

335
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,468
Does lefty like that?

336
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:56,434
(moaning)

337
00:12:56,434 --> 00:13:00,900
Oh, yeah...
lefty like that.

338
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,101
I can't believe I'm taking
sexual advice from Ted Mosby.

339
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,533
That's like taking
fashion advice from...

340
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,334
well, Ted Mosby.

341
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,900
Oh, here's a good one.

342
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,800
"Top Five Things Never
to Do Around Robin."

343
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,834
(snorts)

344
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:19,267
Three: "Never, ever

00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,434
play the 'Guess Who' game
with her."

346
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,867
What do you mean?

347
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,167
Guess who?
(screams)

348
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:29,900
It's me! It's me! It's me!

349
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,001
Number four: "Unless you want to
see it 80 times a day,

350
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:36,834

never show Robin a YouTube clip

351
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:39,134
of an animal playing
a musical instrument."

352
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:42,734
Barney!

353
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,267
Do you have a problem
with this class?

354
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:47,734
Yeah, it's boring as hell
and I'm not learning anything.

355
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,500
Uh, well, maybe the problem
is your attitude.

356
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,301
You're not listening
to a word I say.

357
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:54,201
Uh-huh. Uh, can you
hear this, Professor?

358
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,834
Or should I turn it up for you?

359
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:00,468
It may not have been
a thumbs-up, kids.

360
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:02,533
Oh, you think you're
not learning anything, huh?

361
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,734
Okay.

362
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:06,867
Pop quiz.

363
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,334
What... (grunts)

364
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,767
When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind
of chocolate should you get her?

365
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,167
Trick question.
Get her butterscotch.

366
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,334
Correct! Why?

367
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,600
Butterscotch is
to Canadian women

368
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
what chocolate is
to American women.

369
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Correct!

370
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,734
What is Robin's dream job?

371
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:19,867
To become the most successful

372
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:21,201
female TV journalist of all time.

373
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:23,867
Correct! And if she achieves
that, will she truly be happy?

374
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:26,800
No! Robin's deep-seated need
for attention can  traced back

375
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,234
to her father's
emotional distance,

376
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,101
and no amount of success
will ever make up

377
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,800
for what she truly needs, 
which is six simple words

378
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,267
from her Dad: "Robin,
I'm proud of you, eh?"

379
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:36,101
Yes!

380
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,468
(both panting)

381
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:40,600
But I guess you're right.

382
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,301
You haven't learned anything.

383
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:46,067
Sorry to have wasted your time.

384
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,401
"Oh, Captain! My Captain!"

385
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,934
<i>How good was
Dead Poet's Society?</i>

386
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,533
I know, right?
The end? Tears.

387
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,767
Okay, can I just say that
my deepest need in life

388
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:09,500
not to have my father to
say, "I am proud of you, eh?"

389
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,734
(sobbing):
I'm not crying.

390
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:11,967
Oh, sweetie.

391
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:14,067
Can I get you
some butterscotch?

392
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,567
Oh, stop it.

393
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,934
(sighs)

394
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:20,967
Wait a second.

395
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,567
It says here that the class
meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.

396
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,334
So?
That's right now.

397
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:30,401
Now, as you can see,
well over 50% of the blankets

398
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,434
have been dragged
onto her side.

399
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:33,600
Make no mistake.

400
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,101
Robin Scherbatsky
is a classic, textbook...

401
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:42,234
cover hog.

402
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,633
Any questions?

403
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,667
Yeah, I have one.

404
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,934
Yes, Robin?

405
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,167
(both gasp)

406
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:55,900
Flared nostril ridges.

407
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,967
Wide, unblinking eyes.

408
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,800
Uh-oh.
I got this.

409
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,934
So, emperor penguins--
crazy, huh?

410
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,101
What the hell
do you two think you're doing?

411
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:12,533
Marshall, did you sells out?

412
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:15,201
I said good-bye to
a very dear friend today.

413
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:17,134
Dude, it's a barrel!

414
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:19,134
Aw!
You're giving Mabel away?

415
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:21,067
I have so many questions.

416
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,267
Why would you do this?

417
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:23,867
What were you thinking?

418
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,700
Who the hell is that guy?

419
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,067
Oh, that's Shin-Ya.

420
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,533
He's sort of been
auditing the class.

421
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,867
"Auditing"?

422
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:33,401
Well, tried to explain
to him it wasn't a real class,

423
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:35,034
but I don't think he speaks
much English.

424
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:38,067
On the bright side, he came in
handy standing in for you

425
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,800
during
the role-playing exercises.

426
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Wait.
You did role-playing exercises

427
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,234
where I was played by Shin-Ya?

428
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:48,834
(speaking Chinese)

429
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,834
You know,
I can't believe you, Ted.

430
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,267
You actually think you're
some kind of an expert on me?

431
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,533
<i>Hey! He is an expert.
He's a great teacher!</i>

432
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,633
(sneezing):
Kiss ass.

433
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,567
You know, half the stuff

434
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,600
in this notebook
is patently wrong.

435
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,301
Uh, really?
Name one wrong thing.

436
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:04,468
"Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising
Erogenous Zones"?

437
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,800
Let me clear something up
for you, Ted.

438
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,167
Does lefty like that?

439
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:14,500
Oh. Yeah...

440
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,633
Oh, uh, no.

441
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,934
Um, the right one's
ticklish, I guess.

442
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:23,001
But the left one, yeah,
I'm glad you're back there.

443
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:28,401
Because that is just some
sweet, sweet lovin'.

444
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,900
Noted.

445
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,201
That was a lie?

446
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,468
We had just started dating.
I was being nice.

447
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,500
(laughing)
And you.

448
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,767
You know,

449
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,334
I got it into my head
this week

450
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,633
that you were
cheating on me.

451
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,633
I even broke open your briefcase 
to look for evidence.

452
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,967
That is a huge violation
of my privacy!

453
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,301
Go on.

454
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,134
You know, in a way,
I was right.

455
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,468
You cheated.

456
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:54,368
You can't get some crib
sheet on dating me.

457
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,401
That's not how it works.
If we didn't figure out

458
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:59,567
how to be with each other
in a real, honest way,

459
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:02,167
I don't see the point
of even trying.

460
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,434
(stammers)
(sig)

461
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,867
(speaking Chinese)

462
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,301
What do you want?

463
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:19,667
Look.

464
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,734
All that stuff I told Barney...

465
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,201
It was personal
between you and me.

466
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,934
I'm really sorry.

467
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:29,368
I guess I'm impressed
by how much you remembered.

468
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,067
It's funny.

469
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,633
When you date someone, it's like
you're taking one long course

470
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:38,134
in who that person is and
then, when you break up,

471
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:40,767
all that stuff
becomes useless.

472
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,334
It's the emotional equivalent
of an English degree.

473
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,834
I guess I just liked the idea

474
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,334
of putting all my Robin
Scherbatsky knowledge

475
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,500
to good use, you know?

476
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,401
Well, since you know me
pretty well...

477
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:56,267
am I fooling myself
with this whole Barney thing?

478
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,867
I don't know.

479
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,500
I will say this, though.

480
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,134
I've seen Barney work
Very hard to get women.

481
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:07,034
I've seen him work very
hard to get rid of women.

482
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,167
I've never seen him work
this hard to keep one around.

483
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:13,867
I was going to
give him an A.

484
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:16,967
Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind
of screwed up the curve.

485
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,633
Hey.

486
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,034
Before you say anything,

487
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:25,533
I am done with this
stupid Robin 101, okay?

488
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,533
Here, I'll get rid
of the notebook.

489
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,401
But there's...

490
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:37,167
there's something that
I did want to say to you.

491
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:41,567
Robin, I have been
with a lot of women--

492
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:45,234
blondes, brunettes, redheads;

493
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:49,267
big boobs, small
boobs, medium boobs;

494
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:53,134
some boobs that were big,
but kind of in a bad way.

495
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,334
The point is--

496
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:57,600
boobs that pointed
in opposite direc--

497
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,900
...I'm really scared that
you're going to dump me

498
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,101
and that's why I did
this and I'm sorry.

499
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:13,434
You're an idiot.

500
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:19,533
You know...
Hmm?

501
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:23,667
That notebook, um, does contain
a lot of personal info,

502
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,368
and I think it has
my home address.

503
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:28,434
Hmm. And your
work address.

504
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,401
Whoa.

505
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,368
MARSHALL:
Hey, guys! If you don't want

506
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,101
the barrel,
can you sit somewhere else?

507
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,102
You're scaring away potential takers.

508
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,567
Designed
by Chicago's Daniel Burnham

509
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,501
in the beaux arts style,

510
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:48,734
this architectural gem was
the first of its kind...

511
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:50,467
Uh, Professor Mosby?
Yes, Susan?

512
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:53,100
That's a woman drinking beer
on the toilet.

513
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,701
Right.

514
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,534
That-That...

515
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:59,501
was Daniel Burnham's wife.

516
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,300
She was a troubled,
troubled woman.

517
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,434
We are moving on.
