00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:04,378
<i>I remember one time we all gathered
at my apartment to watch the Super Bowl.</i>

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:06,380
<i>Well, not all of us.</i>

3
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:09,508
<i>Welcome back
to Super Bowl XLIV in Miami.</i>

4
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:11,672
<i>Get a load of that guy.</i>

5
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:14,279
<i>You think that's his real number?</i>

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,452
- Well, that explains where Barney is.
- Dibs on his wings.

7
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,547
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,822
www.sous-titres.eu

9
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:33,407
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

10
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,743
Does anyone know
who won the Super Bowl?

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,833
- You were there. It was the...
- I won,

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,402
because I am now
in possession of a magic phone

13
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:42,833
that always rings.

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,580
And do you know who's always
usually on the other end?

15
00:00:45,705 --> 00:00:46,579
A chick.

16
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:48,981
So how many chicks
do I have calling me now?

17
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:50,187
Infinity.

18
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:53,657
- You guys remember Ranjit.
- Hello.

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,116
Ranjit, good to see you.

20
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:57,504
I've enlisted Ranjit's services
as my personal driver

21
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,194
because for the next week,
I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women,

22
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:03,396
and I don't want to take the subway,
'cause you know, germs.

23
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,279
You're actually gonna hook up
with these girls that call you?

24
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,758
Indubitably.

25
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:10,611
I'm meeting the first one here.
Keep your eyes peeled for a red sweater.

26
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:13,209
Based on her texts, she's dirty,

27
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,648
dyslexic, and wants to 96 me.

28
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:18,035
Semicolon, end parentheses.

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,372
This ought to be good. I can only
imagine the quality of girl that...

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,749
You are the guy from the Super Bowl.

31
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:26,791
Magic phone, guys, magic phone.

32
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,382
- Hey, guys, hey, Ranjit.
- How's it going?

33
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:35,156
- That beer looks a little flat.
- It's Scotch.

34
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,233
Something troubling you, kiddo?

35
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:42,184
<i>Don was Aunt Robin's co-host
on her morning show.</i>

36
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:45,437
<i>Now, even though her show
was on so early that no one watched,</i>

37
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:47,606
<i>Aunt Robin was a consummate
professional,</i>

38
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:49,451
<i>but Don was not.</i>

39
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:52,646
<i>But that morning,
Don had gone too far.</i>

40
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:56,455
Now, that's what I call having
a "woof" over your head.

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,376
Why is Ulee's Gold
in every crossword?

42
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,239
It's me? Sorry, sorry.

43
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:08,867
Next Sunday is Valentine's Day,

44
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:11,377
and one lucky patient
will be receiving

45
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:14,352
a very special chocolate heart,
a human heart.

46
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:17,501
That reminds me.
I've been meaning to ask you.

47
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,805
Do you have any,
Valentine's Day plans?

48
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,591
He asked you out?

49
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,984
- He asked me out.
- That's crazy.

50
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,812
And they use "Ulee"
'cause of the vowels.

51
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,148
What did you say?

52
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,359
We were on the air,
I was on the spot, so I said okay.

53
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:37,606
Robin, you are going to marry
this guy so freaking hard.

54
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:39,033
Right in the butt.

55
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,827
What?! No, I hate Don,

56
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,331
and now I can't cancel because I said
I would go out with him on the air.

57
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,449
What would your viewer think?

58
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:51,188
You said you'd go out with him
on Valentine's? I thought we had plans.

59
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:54,317
Getting drunk
and cleaning the apartment was a plan?

60
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:55,867
I did not

61
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,768
say it was a good plan.

62
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,096
Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now,

63
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:03,599
and it is getting interesting.

64
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,189
Look at these texts. Read this one.

65
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,593
Now, look at this one.

66
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:11,013
Does she text
her mother with those fingers?

67
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:13,441
Now, look at this one.
Or this one,

68
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:14,850
or this one.

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,936
Buddy, how about you do this?

70
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:20,658
Go nail that girl,
then read your texts.

71
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,082
I can't do that.

72
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,284
I just can't hook up with a girl

73
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,477
if there is a hotter girl out there

74
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:28,749
with whom up can be hooked.

75
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,168
Isn't there always a hotter girl?

76
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,283
I know.

77
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,838
Isn't it wonderful?

78
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,564
Go for Barney.
Cut to the chase, what's your cup size?

79
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:38,634
Hi, Mom.

80
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,348
There's always a hotter girl.
Isn't that the problem in a nutshell?

81
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,856
There's too many options,
you got Internet dating, you got bars...

82
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,844
Holding up your phone number
on national TV.

83
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,338
I never had that problem.

84
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,611
When I was 18,
I had an arranged marriage,

85
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,547
and I love my wife
more and more every day.

86
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:05,710
It is true. It's, it's very rare
that two people just meet

87
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:08,497
and fall madly in love,
like Robin and Don.

88
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,762
We're not even, like,
going out for dinner.

89
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,649
We're just hanging out at his place.

90
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,380
It's not like that. It's just us
and a bunch of other people.

91
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:22,344
Wait, Robin, what exactly did
Don say when he asked you out?

92
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,063
I'm having some friends 
for a little party. You should

93
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:26,582
come by if you want.

94
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:35,274
Robin, Don didn't ask you out.

95
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,694
- Of course he asked me out.
- No, he didn't.

96
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:39,987
Yes, he did.

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,821
He did.

98
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,198
He did, he did!

99
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,533
Well, dog my cats.

100
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:48,787
I think I know what's going on here.

101
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:51,332
Did you want Don to ask you out?

102
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
What?!

103
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,077
No, I hate Don.

104
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:57,571
I can't stop thinking
about how much I hate him.

105
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:00,516
It's like, it's like all the time.
I just want to attack him

106
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:04,018
and rip his stupid clothes off,
just spank him with his little paddle

107
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:05,843
until his bum's all red.

108
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,097
Shut up!

109
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:13,563
See? That right there
is what free will gets you...

110
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,204
Constant, ego-shattering
uncertainty.

111
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:18,901
I'm done with that.
I want what Ranjit has.

112
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:22,368
I've spent my entire adult life
looking for the perfect woman,

113
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,989
and I'm spending Valentine's Day
scrubbing the toilet.

114
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:28,345
I need someone else
to find me that woman.

115
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,784
Arranged marriage me.

116
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:38,007
Or this one or this one or this one.

117
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:45,627
You want us
to arrange your marriage?

118
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,301
Absolutely.
There's two sides to dating, right?

119
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,024
Picking and getting picked.

120
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,957
Getting picked I'm good at.

121
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:53,811
Ladies love Teddy West Side.

122
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:59,900
You're waiting for me to comment
on your self-assigned nickname.

123
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:02,658
Here's my comment.

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,327
- I love it.
- Really?

125
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:06,462
Teddy West Side, continue.

126
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,282
It's the picking I suck at.
I pick the wrong girls.

127
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:12,469
But you're the best pickers I know.
You picked each other.

128
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,615
With a slight assist
from the Wesleyan Housing Department.

129
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,090
And a healthy splash
of Drakkar Noir.

130
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,438
Get out there, find me a girl.
We'll double-date on Valentine's Day.

131
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:24,715
If I like her, I will marry her...

132
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,150
if she's cool with it,
and she will be...

133
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,155
Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.

134
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:31,645
I love that blazer

135
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:33,976
almost as much as Robin loves Don.

136
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:35,941
I do not love Don.

137
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,799
Neurologically speaking,

138
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:40,194
the part of the human brain
that makes you hate people

139
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,377
is located right next
to the part of the brain

140
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,985
that makes you want to jump them.

141
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:47,614
The two responses are so similar,
it's hard to tell them apart.

142
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,998
You know what it's like?
I have to get a book.

143
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,206
Give me 30 seconds!

144
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,841
This is fun.

145
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,477
Look at this picture.
It's a rabbit.

146
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:57,202
You can look at it for hours

147
00:06:57,327 --> 00:07:00,045
and be absolutely sure
it's a rabbit,

148
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,672
but then one day you look at it
and you realize... wait a second...

149
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:05,712
it's a duck.

150
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,135
A rabbit, a duck.

151
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,347
Isn't this fun?

152
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,596
<i>It sure was.</i>

153
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,387
Relationships are like that.

154
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,436
When you first met Don,
you hated him.

155
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,578
You thought, "This guy is a duck",

156
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:21,904
but one of these days,
you're going to realize,

157
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,814
"This is actually something I love.

158
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,191
"He's a rabbit."

159
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,258
You got it backwards there.

160
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,768
The duck is the thing you love,

161
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:32,350
the rabbit is the thing you hate.

162
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:35,204
I gotta agree;
ducks up, rabbits down.

163
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,521
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ducks are...

165
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:42,260
Rabbits are adorable!
Ducks are, like...

166
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:44,762
Have you ever been
in a fight with a duck?

167
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,381
I mean, ducks are jerks!

168
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,539
<i>This led to one of the most
intense arguments</i>

169
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,159
<i>our group has ever had.</i>

170
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,056
Duck is delicious!
Rabbit is all gamey!

171
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:55,766
We're not talking about flavor!

172
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:56,849
Flavor counts!

173
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,813
Who carries around a duck's foot
for good luck! Anyone!

174
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,717
You wrap yourself
in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair!

175
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:09,420
I'll wrap myself in one
stuffed with duck feathers!

176
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,697
Who's cozier?

177
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,699
But who's cozier?!

178
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,661
Hold on! I have to get another book!

179
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,284
Why don't we take a rabbit, a duck,

180
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,676
stick 'em in a cardboard box,
and let them fight it out?!

181
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,261
Because it's illegal, Ted!

182
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,220
Only if we bet on it, Marshall!

183
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:36,975
Fine!

184
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,268
I concede!

185
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:41,483
You win!

186
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,019
Say it.

187
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,478
You have to say it.

188
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:48,281
Ducks good...

189
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:53,472
rabbits are bad.

190
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,803
Thank you. And Don is...

191
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,306
And always will be... a rabbit.

192
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,522
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

193
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:05,147
Think about it. Don?

194
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:06,761
Donald?

195
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:08,284
Donald...

196
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:09,756
Duck?

197
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:12,317
And what, I wonder,

198
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:15,373
does Donald Duck never wear?

199
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,764
- Pants.
- Pants.

200
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,642
Don's a duck.

201
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,131
- Can I say "lawyered"?
- I'll allow it.

202
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,101
<i>Yes, kids, sometimes
there's a fine line</i>

203
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,570
<i>between love and hate.
Case in point:</i>

204
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:34,406
There is no place
I would rather be...

205
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,867
and no one I'd rather be with.

206
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,064
I should get that.

207
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,169
Go for Barney.

208
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,839
I'm sort of in the middle of someone...
something right now, and I...

209
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:53,842
You're a hot lady bullfighter?

210
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,116
You gotta go.

211
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,883
MacLaren's Pub.

212
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,724
There is no place I would rather be

213
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,992
and no one I would rather be...

214
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:16,475
Would you excuse me for one moment?

215
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:18,535
Go for Barney.

216
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,162
You're a gold medalist
Japanese figure skater?

217
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,997
<i>Adios, muchacha!</i>

218
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,647
No place I'd rather be,
no one I'd rather...

219
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,272
For Pete's sake!

220
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,343
You're a hot chick?

221
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:38,057
<i>Sayonara!</i>

222
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,964
I realize that you're very busy,

223
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,980
so I'll just get straight
to the point.

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Shakah!

225
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,593
And that's my bad leg.

226
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:04,931
Very bad.

227
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:10,243
Are you okay?

228
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:13,411
Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

229
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,806
Go for Barney.

230
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:20,564
<i>Barney had been sure
that phone was something he loved,</i>

231
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,993
<i>but now,
he realized it wasn't that at all.</i>

232
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:25,168
It was something else entirely.

233
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,617
I'm free.

234
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:40,307
Now this feels right.

235
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,919
There is no place I would rather be.

236
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,254
And no one I would rather be...

237
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,542
What's wrong?

238
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,878
Did you hear that?

239
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,463
Hear what?

240
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,533
Go for Barney.

241
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:32,232
D cups?
Really?

242
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:35,176
<i>Finally Valentine's Day arrived,</i>

243
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:38,056
<i>the deadline for Marshall and Lily
to find me a wife.</i>

244
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:40,926
<i>An important job they had,
well, forgotten to do.</i>

245
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:42,969
Aren't we go
on a double date with Ted.

246
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,975
Ted?
No, he's not seeing anyone.

247
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,140
Remember he asked us to find a...

248
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,171
Want to get married?

249
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:58,249
I don't know what kind of architect!
Houses, buildings, that kind of crap.

250
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,279
Want to marry my friend Ted?

251
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,402
What, you can be choosy?

252
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:08,117
You're in a bar on Valentine's Day!

253
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:09,955
Just real quick...

254
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,779
You want to marry my friend Ted?

255
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,338
Man, Ted's right.
It's tough out there.

256
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,680
This is stupid.
You know what? We forgot about this.

257
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,260
I'm sure Ted did, also.

258
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,160
<i>Here comes the groom,</i>

259
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,057
<i>in his favorite blazer,</i>

260
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,455
<i>gonna meet my wife and I...</i>

261
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,579
Blazer, Tazer.

262
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:34,155
Gazer, Ta... Bazer?

263
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,631
Before you go meet your future wife,

264
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:40,068
why don't you come
to Don's party with me?

265
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,362
You're wearing this?

266
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:43,739
Why?

267
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,007
He's a duck.

268
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,075
That dude be straight duckin'.

269
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,289
<i>And I think that I'll amaze her. </i>

270
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,372
Nailed it!

271
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:54,992
<i>So we went to Don's party.</i>

272
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:57,843
I don't want to crowd you
on your little date here,

273
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,922
- so if things start to get hot...
- They're not gonna get hot...

274
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,623
I'm just saying, if they do,

275
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,680
I'll just say,
"Well, I got a dinner rez", and then...

276
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,263
It's the best part.
I've been working on this for a while.

277
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,516
I'll duck out.

278
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,015
It's not gonna happen.

279
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,269
But do that.

280
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:23,630
Well, I got a dinner rez.

281
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,034
Don, what the hell are you doing?

282
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,161
It's something called The Naked Man.

283
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,469
I read about it on some guy's blog.

284
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:34,889
I'm so stupid.

285
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:36,750
Why did I think
it would work on you?

286
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,277
 'cause I would never...

287
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:42,640
Could, like... standards,
so, you know.

288
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,257
I thought this was a party.

289
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:47,719
I said that to get you to come.
I didn't think you'd bring a date.

290
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,680
Ted's not my date.
He's a friend.

291
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,682
You think
I'm some kind of playboy now.

292
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:58,400
You could say that.

293
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,816
So he's a rabbit.

294
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,501
At least you know for sure.

295
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,326
This may hurt a little.

296
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:07,739
I'm recycling
your old Architecture Weekly Magazines.

297
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,699
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning.

298
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,437
You go on your date.

299
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,078
Happy Valentine's Day.

300
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:20,126
You're here.

301
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,588
I've been thinking.
Maybe we should call this off.

302
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:25,761
- We got her.
- What?

303
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,389
We got her.
It's crazy.

304
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:30,303
We were searching all week,
and then, a couple hours ago...

305
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:31,429
Trudy?

306
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,556
Married.

307
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,452
- Blah, blah?
- Committed.

308
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:36,201
- Relationship?
- Bellevue.

309
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:38,019
Natalie?

310
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:40,230
Ted's her least favorite person
in the world.

311
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,482
Well, she's not getting any younger.

312
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,485
Get rid of it!

313
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,737
- What?
- This phone is cursed.

314
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,333
Cursed, I tell you!

315
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,201
I try to ignore it,
but it just never stops ringing!

316
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,974
It's ruining my life!

317
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:55,370
I should get that.

318
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,326
Please!

319
00:15:57,451 --> 00:15:59,452
Let me answer it.
It could be an emergency.

320
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,877
She could be trapped in a giant bra!

321
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,417
Let it go... to voice mail.

322
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,808
We have to find a wife.
We're being too choosy.

323
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,810
It doesn't matter who it is.

324
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,357
It's a phone girl?

325
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,515
I know, but no.

326
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,065
Then we met her, and Ted,

327
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,640
she's a world-class violinist,
she's a gourmet cook, and...

328
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,472
she can quote
every line from Caddyshack.

329
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:42,244
"And what brings you
to this nape of the woods?"

330
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:43,661
"Neck of the wape?"

331
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:44,878
Why are you here?

332
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:48,536
<i>So we all had dinner.</i>

333
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:51,635
<i>And kids, Lily ans Marshall's hard work
had paid off,</i>

334
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,551
because that girl was terrific.

335
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:54,554
In fact...

336
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:57,606
But Natalia, tell Ted the problem.

337
00:16:58,286 --> 00:16:59,559
Tell him!

338
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,773
Unfortunately, I'm going to have
to leave the country soon

339
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,836
because my visa is about to expire.

340
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,636
She needs to get married!

341
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,309
Federal law expressly dictates
that a foreign national

342
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:14,643
can't maintain residency for longer
than six months without a work visa.

343
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,813
<i>But when it came down...</i>

344
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,204
And you, sir?
The rabbit or the duck?

345
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,410
What?

346
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,567
It's a prix-fixe menu,
we're out of steak, fish and chicken.

347
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,316
So, rabbit or duck?

348
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,386
Rabbit.
Sorry, guys.

349
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,517
I got to go.

350
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,450
Why would Ted order rabbit
if he was gonna run out?

351
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,690
I need it back!
Where's the phone?

352
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:44,903
I met you already.

353
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:46,189
Where's the phone?

354
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:47,607
It's hidden.

355
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,628
Where?

356
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:50,318
<i>Where had Lily hidden the phone?</i>

357
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,821
To answer that question,
we have to back up a little bit.

358
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,597
You go on your date.

359
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,366
Happy Valentine's Day.

360
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:08,486
It's Barney's phone.

361
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:10,350
I wonder how it got in there.

362
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,467
Come on.
Big date.

363
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:18,289
What's the harm?

364
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:22,058
<i>And just like that, I was hooked.</i>

365
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,603
Terrific, I will see you there.
I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer.

366
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:29,264
I think you'll know the blazer
when you see it.

367
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:30,757
I gotta go.

368
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:32,569
You're here.

369
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,287
So... rabbit or duck?

370
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,829
Rabbit.
Sorry, guys.

371
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,047
I gotta go.

372
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:50,587
Sorry, babe.
I gotta take this.

373
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,297
Barney's phone.

374
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,466
- Teddy West Side speaking.
- It's my phone!

375
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,135
I am taking it back!
And I'm taking your cool nickname, too!

376
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,901
Barney West Side speaking.

377
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:01,253
I love it so much!
It just keeps ringing.

378
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:02,578
Give it to me.

379
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:14,631
Being single sucks.

380
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:16,400
It turns you into a crazy person.

381
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:17,525
I know.

382
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,700
So much running around and freaking out,
and for what?

383
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:24,149
It's all so you can find someone
you can sit on a couch

384
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:26,262
and put off cleaning
the bathroom with.

385
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,959
The joke's on the rest of the world,
because we can do that on our own.

386
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:31,753
Exactly.

387
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,795
Exactly.

388
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,143
- I have to apologize...
- Just save it. Let's do the news.

389
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:51,087
No, listen.

390
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,969
After you left the other night,
I was embarrassed.

391
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,362
Not because I was naked.
I'm actually okay with my body.

392
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,404
Clearly.

393
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,596
I got married in college.

394
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,377
I just got divorced three months ago.
I have no idea how to be single.

395
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,277
But that's not why
I was embarrassed.

396
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:12,581
I was embarrassed about my behavior
right here at Channel...

397
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,091
It starts with a one.

398
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,108
12.

399
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:20,476
I mean, just look at your mug.

400
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:21,594
Right.

401
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,690
Well, no. You look at this mug.

402
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,408
You are a tremendous news anchor.

403
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,685
And you deserve a co-anchor
who gives a crap.

404
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,219
And from here on out,

405
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:32,897
that's gonna be me.

406
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:35,233
I'll believe that when I see it.

407
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,812
You'll see it right now.

408
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:39,237
I'll go get you coffee.

409
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,743
You're wearing pants.

410
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,136
Well, look at that.

411
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:53,467
Duck.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
