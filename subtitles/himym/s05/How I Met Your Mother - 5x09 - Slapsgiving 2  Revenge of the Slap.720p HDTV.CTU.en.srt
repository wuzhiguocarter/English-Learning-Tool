<i>NARRATOR:
In November 2009,</i>

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,367
<i>Uncle Marshall
and Aunt Lily hosted</i>

3
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:05,500
<i>the first Thanksgiving
at their very own apartment.</i>

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,367
<i>And Marshall had found
the perfect turkey.</i>

5
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:11,634
Oh, baby, it is beautiful.

6
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:14,300
It's 22 pounds.
It's organic.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,234
You remember my bald
Uncle Heinrek?

8
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,333
It looks exactly like his head.

9
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,901
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,433
My turkey...

11
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,300
My turkey!

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,934
<i>So, when we showed up
for the big day,</i>

13
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:28,101
<i>Marshall was pretty bummed out.</i>

14
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:30,134
Well, we got the turkey.
MARSHALL: No.

15
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:32,067
You didn't. You got the pathetic
replacement turkey.

16
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,967
Damn it, you know,
why didn't I just listen

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,134
to the prerecorded voice
of former Mayor Ed Koch

18
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,600
reminding me
to take my belongings?

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,400
No, Marshall,
you don't understand.

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,767
Robin and I went to the Port
Authority Lost and Found,

21
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,667
and there,
sitting in their fridge...

22
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,101
ROBIN: Marshall Eriksen...

23
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,901
is this your turkey?
Yes!

24
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,567
That's my turkey!

25
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,234
Oh, come here,
you handsome little bastard!

26
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:55,734
Okay, I'm going to go put this in the oven.
Okay.

27
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:58,367
Oh, my God! You guys are
the best friends ever!

28
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:01,201
It was totally
a team effort.

29
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:03,667
I'm so ha...

30
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,634
Guys, I don't know
what to say.

31
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:07,201
I mean, it's Thanksgiving,
but "thanks"

32
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,534
just doesn't seem like enough.

33
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,367
Come on, buddy, you would've
done the same thing for us.

34
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:11,368
Yeah, I would, and you know why?

35
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:12,967
Because I love you guys.

36
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,167
And I'm gonna show you
just how much.

37
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,067
Ted Mosby,
Robin Scherbatsky,

38
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,668
I bequeath unto you

39
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:21,933
the fourth slap.

40
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:22,900
(both gasp)

41
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,000
Wait, what?

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,100
<i>Kids, you remember</i>

43
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
<i>Barney and Marshall'
"Slap Bet."</i>

44
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,234
<i>When Barney lost, Marshall won
the right to slap Barney</i>

45
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:31,634
<i>five times as hard as he could.</i>

46
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,367
<i>So far, he'd used three
of those five slaps.</i>

47
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,867
(Barney grunts)

48
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:37,867
<i>With the third
being doled out exactly</i>

49
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:41,167
<i>two years earlier
on Thanksgiving Day 2007.</i>

50
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,401
<i>A day that history came to know</i>

51
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,933
<i>as "Slapsgiving."</i>

52
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,100
Are you saying...

53
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,601
...what we think
you're saying?

54
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,200
Probably not.

55
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:51,267
Unless you think I'm saying

56
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,833
"Slapsgiving Two:
Revenge Of The Slap,"

57
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,934
in which case, yes, that's
exactly what I'm saying!

58
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:59,433
(Ted and Robin cheer)
No way! Uh-uh.

59
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:00,967
Slaps aren't transferable.

60
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,700
Lily is the Slap Bet
Commissioner.  Lil?

61
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,767
Slaps are transferable.

62
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,634
No!
Transferable!

63
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,134
Wait, Marshall,
you realize you'll only have

64
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,300
one left after this.

65
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,367
Are you sure you want
to spend this slap today?

66
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:15,034
Life is short.
I figured, Slap-e Diem.

67
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,834
Okay, rule number one: the slap 
must occur before sundown,

68
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,834
so as not to interfere
with Lily's meal.

69
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,333
Damn straight.
Two, you guys have to decide

70
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,901
amongst yourselves
who gets to do it.

71
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:23,901
Three...

72
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,467
we're going to tie
Barney to this

73
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,034
chair, which shall
henceforth be referred to as

74
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,001
The Slapping Throne. Sound fair?
Totally.

75
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,767
ROBIN: Amazing.
Absolutely not!

76
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,201
<i>It was all set to be the best
Thanksgiving ever.</i>

77
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,067
<i>Until...
(doorbell rings)</i>

78
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,801
Are we expecting somebody else?

79
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,534
<i>It was someone Lily hadn't
seen or spoken to</i>

80
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,700
<i>in three years.</i>

81
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,534
Dad.

83
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,301
<i>Now, Lily and her dad, Mickey,</i>

84
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:02,501
<i>had always had
a tough relationship.</i>

85
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,833
<i>Mickey's dream was to invent</i>

86
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,768
<i>the next great
American board game.</i>

87
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,734
<i>But his ideas
were always a little off.</i>

88
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,534
Daddy?
Yeah?

89
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,668
You missed
my ballet recital.

90
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:13,167
Yes, sweetie, but, look!

91
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:16,267
I just put the finishing touches
on my new, hit board game,

92
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,768
"Tijuana Slumlord."

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,267
Daddy?
Uh-huh?

94
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,268
You missed my gymnastics meet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

95
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,134
<i>But this is the one!</i>

96
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,134
"Car Battery:
How Long Can You Hold On?"

97
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,067
(chuckling)

98
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:33,867
Here, Princess.

99
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,134
Grab these.

100
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,168
Daddy?
Mm-hmm.

101
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,634
I had a nightmare.

102
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,934
Aw, sweetie.

103
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:44,901
Here, come play
Daddy's new game:

104
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:47,300
"There's A Clown Demon
Under The Bed!"

105
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,700
(screaming)

106
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,867
<i>Her whole life, Mickey
disappointed Lily.</i>

107
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:54,467
<i>And she always put up with it,
until one day in 2006</i>

108
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,667
<i>when Lily went to visit her
grandparents.</i>

109
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,134
So, Rita, are you
excited about the, uh,

110
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,333
the big move to Florida?

111
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,534
Actually, dear,
slight change of plans.

112
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:03,801
We're staying here
for the time being.

113
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,433
We had a slight
financial hiccup.

114
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,500
MICKEY:
Ma!

115
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,333
The straw to my juice box broke!

116
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,901
Ma, chop, chop!

117
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,034
Oh, hey, guys.

118
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:19,867
What a pleasant surprise.

119
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,034
Dad, what happened

120
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:22,567
to your apartment?

121
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,833
Oh, well, I had a little
falling out with my roommate.

122
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,900
What happened?

123
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,267
He wanted me to pay rent.

124
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,134
Got kind of ugly.
Dad!

125
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,334
You should be paying rent,

126
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:32,501
not living
in your parents' basement.

127
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,200
Hey, it's not my first choice.

128
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,034
Having the old farts
right upstairs

129
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,501
is crimpin' my style a bit.

130
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,767
Clearly, they're not
getting the whole

131
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,534
"sock on the doorknob" thing.

132
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:42,667
Oh, they caught you with a girl?

133
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,268
In a way.

134
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,867
Bye, sweetheart.
I'm off to work.

135
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,400
Work? You're retired.

136
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,101
Now that I have
extra mouth to feed,

137
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,867
I had to go back
to the steel mill.

138
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,001
Rita?

139
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,234
Where's my truss?

140
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:58,500
So, not only did you stop them
From moving to Florida,

141
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,234
but now you forced Grandpa
to go back to work?

142
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,235
Just until I get Aldrin games Unlimted

143
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,767
off the ground
with my new sensation:

144
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,901
"Dog Fight Promoter."

145
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,700
<i>And then Lily gave her dad
a look that Marshall</i>

146
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,567
<i>had only seen
a few times before.</i>

147
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:17,001
<i>A look we all prayed never
to be on the receiving end of:</i>

148
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,300
<i>her "You're Dead To Me" look.</i>

149
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,767
<i>Which brings us back
to Thanksgiving of 2009.</i>

150
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:28,168
Hey, Princess.

151
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,300
I brought "Diseases!"

152
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,301
What is he doing here?

153
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,267
I don't know,
but maybe we should,

154
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,501
uh, let him in and find out.

155
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,867
No, I don't want to see him!

156
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,167
Get rid of him!

157
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,534
Hey, Mickey.

158
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:50,501
Just hang tight, okay?

159
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,568
We'll, well work this out.

160
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,733
Take your time, amigo.

161
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,967
I'm okays long
as I have "Diseases!"

162
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:56,501
The fun's infectious.

163
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,834
(both laughing)

164
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,633
God, I hope Lily's okay.

165
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,967
Me, too.
She doesn't talk about it much,

166
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,267
but this thing with her dad
causes her a lot of pain.

167
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:12,667
Just tell me which one of you's
gonna slap me!

168
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,633
What?
I'm dying over here!

169
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,968
Ted reaches for a chip,
I flinch!

170
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:18,467
Robin fixes her hair, I flinch!

171
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,300
I'm doing so much flinching.
It's bad for my skin.

172
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,034
I'm getting crow's feet.
Crow's feet!

173
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,534
Lily, come on.
It's been

174
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,567
three years, okay?
That's long enough.

175
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:32,034
Having him in my life causes me
nothing but stress.

176
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:35,035
It's just easier for him to be dead to me.

177
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:37,034
Okay, Lily, look.

178
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,734
I supported you when
our neighbor, Mr. Sias,

179
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,100
was "dead to you."

180
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,068
Hey!
That's our newspaper.

181
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:46,601
You'll get it back
in 15 minutes.

182
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:49,867
Make it 20.
I had a steak last night.

183
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,601
And I was fine when your

184
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:01,034
bridesmaid, Whitney,
was "dead to you."

185
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,567
Oh, Lily!

186
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,367
You look so amazing!

187
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,734
That dress is gorgeous!

188
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,167
Oh, thanks, guys.

189
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,601
Mm, I... I'm just
not a fan of strapless.

190
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,467
I even understood when

191
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:22,200
Mr. Park from the bodega
downstairs was "dead to you."

192
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,634
One coffee, please.

193
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,068
Oh, but only if you have decaf.

194
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,634
I don't want to be up all night.

195
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:28,867
Dollar fifty.

196
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,233
Coffee, regular.

197
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,233
Dollar fifty.

198
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,500
Excuse me.

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,367
Are you sure mine was decaf?

200
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,867
You just used the same pot.

201
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:44,568
Oh, I lie to him. Okay?

202
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:50,501
Oh, okay.

203
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:53,101
You son of a bitch.

204
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,667
That was not decaf!

205
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,301
(glass breaking)

206
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,167
I supported you

207
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,501
with all of those random people,
but this is your father.

208
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,401
Okay, can't we at least just
give him some turkey?

209
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:13,867
No.
Come on, Lily.

210
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,901
Please, I can't ask the guy
to leave on Thanksgiving.

211
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,767
Oh, you don't have to ask.

212
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,434
Just tell him that it's really
important that he be here.

213
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,200
And before you know it, he'll be
at a board game convention

214
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,801
in Toledo, giving your braces
money to some guy

215
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,667
claiming to be Milton Bradley.

216
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,534
He was just out trying
to provide for the family.

217
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:35,600
No. No, that's what my mom did
by working two jobs.

218
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,401
Marshall, that man

219
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:41,834
broke my heart every single day
for 20 years.

220
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:46,534
Well, then we'll just give him
some dark meat.

221
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,900
No, seriously, Robin,

222
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,134
you should get the slap.

223
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,733
I mean, you're a great slapper.

224
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:52,700
In fact, I want

225
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,900
to study slapping
under your tutelage.

226
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,867
I want to be your slap-prentice.

227
00:08:58,034 --> 00:08:59,834
Don't sell yourself
short there, Teddy.

228
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,201
You're a slapping rock star.

229
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,468
Your name should be
Eric Slapton.

230
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:05,267
Okay, okay, guys,
this is torture.

231
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,434
Just put me in the chair...

232
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,967
Slapping Throne.
And get it over with!

233
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,134
Ok, he's all yours.
No-no-no-no. It's you, I insist.

234
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,968
Okay, I'll do it.
Great.

235
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:13,601
Wait, what?

236
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:15,601
I'm just saying, I'll slap him.

237
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,001
What, so that's just, like,

238
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:18,200
the end of the discussion?

239
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,068
Well, you said I could slap him.

240
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:23,900
Uh, I was just being nice.

241
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,967
If anyone's gonna slap him,
it's gonna be me.

242
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,900
No, it's not.

243
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,167
This is interesting.

244
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,034
Lily, he's family, okay?

245
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,733
And I'm sorry, but you just
don't cut off family.

246
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,134
Oh, well, that's easy for you
to say when you come

247
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:45,633
from the most ridiculously close
family in the world.

248
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,401
We are not ridiculously close.

249
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,800
Really?
Yeah.

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,267
What about the Eriksen Family
Dinner every single Sunday?

251
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,568
Everything looks delicious,
Mother Eriksen.

252
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:55,434
Thank you,
Papa Bear.

253
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:59,800
Marshall, would you
like to say grace?

254
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,167
(on monitor):
Well, I would be

255
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,568
happy to, Mother.

256
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,201
Everyone, please join hands.

257
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:11,900
Dear Lord...

258
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,834
I'm sorry, but that's weird.

259
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,867
A family should be that close.

260
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,967
And I want our future family
to be that close.

261
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,101
And that includes your dad.

262
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,134
I can't believe
you're taking his side.

263
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,334
Lily...
Let me

264
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:25,434
be clear on this:
that man will never

265
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:28,568
cross the threshold
into this home, ever!

266
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:31,600
It's just gonna be, like,
five more minutes.

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,468
Hopefully soon, amigo.

268
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:36,101
I'm fighting a losing battle
with hemorrhoids here.

269
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:37,967
Oh, that's one of the diseases?

270
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:40,334
No.

271
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,000
Ted, there is an hour
before the sun sets,

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,633
at which point, neither one
of us gets to slap Barney.

273
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:50,401
So just let me have it.
I'm the one who had

274
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,134
the idea to call the Port
Authority Lost and Found.

275
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,634
Ooh, that's a good point.
Rebuttal?

276
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,300
I'm the one who slipped
the guy a 20!

277
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,667
Oh, philosophical
conundrum.

278
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,133
Idea versus execution.
Please discuss at length.

279
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,167
I carried that huge turkey
all the way up here.

280
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:03,568
I paid the cab fare.

281
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,934
Well, you slept
with one of my best friends!

282
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,001
What?! You, you said

283
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,667
you were okay with that.
Well, I'm not!

284
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,601
Well, why didn't you
say something at the time?

285
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,233
Because I'm still in love
with you!

286
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,634
Do you really want to slap
Barney so bad

287
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,901
that you would lie
about being in love with me?

288
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,601
I rely want to slap him, okay?

289
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,100
Yes, your dad has made some
mistakes in the past,

290
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,767
but he's a different
person now.

291
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,134
He's moved out of your
grandparents' house.

292
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:31,301
He's got a job.

293
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,000
He's paying off his IRS debts.

294
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,367
Wait, how do you know all that?

295
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:37,800
Like, body language.

296
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,834
Okay, well, yeah,
we met for a drink last week.

297
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,334
I mis her a ton.

298
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,334
Little princess.

299
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,700
She ever talk about me?

300
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,767
Yeah. Yeah, like, all the time.

301
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:54,967
Um, she tells this one really
sweet story about...

302
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,400
So never, huh?
No, not a word.

303
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,801
But...

304
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,467
it doesn't have to be that way.

305
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,367
We can, we can fix this, right?

306
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,734
(scoffs)

307
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:06,634
You know, I always thought
it'd get fixed at the wedding.

308
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,300
I even wrote a toast.

309
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,701
But then, no invite.

310
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,300
Hell, I haven't even seen a wedding photo.

311
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,068
<i>MARSHALL:
And then, right before my eyes,</i>

312
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:22,400
<i>your father
broke down crying.</i>

313
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,701
(sobbing)

314
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,834
That's it!
You're coming to Thanksgiving!

315
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:30,534
You invited him?!

316
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,867
The guy was, like, blabbering.

317
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,900
What was I going to do?
And then, some jerk

318
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,600
at the next table
called him a sissy,

319
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,501
which I thought
was totally uncalled-for.

320
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,600
I can't believe you.

321
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Marshall, what gives you
the right to do that?

322
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,034
You and I are married.

323
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:45,167
And that means
he's my family, too.

324
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:54,368
Mickey, come on in.

325
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,201
(timer ticking)
Ted, you better roll quickly.

326
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,034
Your gall bladder's
about to burst.

327
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,900
You know, Mickey, it's been,
like, half an hour.

328
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,434
I think we should
go look for Lily.

329
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:14,968
Eh, she just needs
some time to cool down.

330
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:15,801
Let's finish the game.

331
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:16,868
Yeah, play
another round.

332
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:18,267
Best of seven!

333
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:19,367
Damn it, Robin!

334
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,701
I've known Barney the longest.

335
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,034
I get to slap him.

336
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,167
That slap is mine, Mosby.

337
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,934
I've never slapped Barney...

338
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,634
above the waist.

339
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:29,434
Look, I've wanted to slap Barney
since the moment

340
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,968
I met him! You don't think
that I want

341
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:33,133
to slap Barney? I've waited...
Wait, wait a minute. Wait a mute!

342
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,968
This slap was supposed to be
a wonderful thing, a gift,

343
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:39,800
and look, it's turned us
against each other.

344
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,501
My God, you're right.

345
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:47,034
This once pure fruit has turned
into a poison slapple.

346
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,468
You know what?
Seriously, you take it.

347
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:50,600
Are you sure?

348
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,367
Slapsolutely.

349
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:54,234
I really think

350
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,633
that we should
go look for Lily.

351
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:59,568
Ted? Gall bladder
about to pop.

352
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,700
Okay, it's decided.

353
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,767
Barney, come on. Get in the Throne.
Hmm?

354
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,600
Are you...
Yep. Come on.

355
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,034
Well, you, um...

356
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,900
Uh, well, I guess that is

357
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,900
the best decision, Robin.
I mean...

358
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,501
men are stronger than women.

359
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,733
D-Don't listen to him.

360
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,501
Okay, it's been decided.
Okay.

361
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,667
And that's what you've always
wanted, isn't it, Robin?

362
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,633
A strong man
to take care of you?

363
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:23,800
I mean, sure. Growing up,
you were a scrapper,

364
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
Playing hockey with the boys,

365
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,867
skinning your knees
on the ice.

366
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,334
But what you couldn't
tell your teammates--

367
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:33,167
what you couldn't
even tell yourself--

368
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,200
was that all you really wanted

369
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,767
was that pretty white dress

370
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,934
in that pretty white chapel.

371
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:43,935
And at the end of the centre aisle, 

372
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:47,035
strewn with pretty white flowers,

373
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:48,935
a man

374
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:51,202
to do all your slapping for you.

375
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:52,701
Let me at him!
Robin! Come on!

376
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,634
Hold on!
(dings)

377
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,268
Oh!

378
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,268
Oh, my God.

379
00:14:57,268 --> 00:14:58,235
What just happened?

380
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:00,701
Sorry, Ted.
Gallbladder burst.

381
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,768
You move back
three spaces.

382
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:05,002
You come in here,

383
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,902
and you watch your daughter
leave and you don't even care.

384
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,668
And now you've destroyed
Thanksgiving dinner!

385
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,602
Lily-Lily worked
all day on this!

386
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,535
Relax. It's not real bile.

387
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:17,134
It's just lead-based
paint from China.

388
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,234
And horse bile.

389
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,735
<i>And at that moment,
Marshall gave Mickey a look</i>

390
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:25,335
<i>none of us has ever
seen him give anyone.</i>

391
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:26,635
What's this? What's he doing?

392
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,368
Did you swallow
some of that paint?

393
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,468
This is my "you're dead to me" look.

394
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,602
Oh. Oh.
Okay.

395
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:34,335
Yeah, you know,
Lily's is so much better...

396
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:36,201
Get out of my house!

397
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,502
Hey.

398
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,068
Mr. Park's, huh?

399
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,601
This is the last place
I expected to find you.

400
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:47,202
Marshall
Lily, I'm sorry.

401
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:49,668
But just hear me out.

402
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:52,668
I used to think that
family was-was a right.

403
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:56,435
But it's not. It's a privilege,
and it has to be earned.

404
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,701
I kicked your dad out.

405
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:58,901
And I promise,

406
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:02,202
baby, I will... I will never
make you see him again.

407
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,701
Oh, what?

408
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,168
Baby, what-what happened?

409
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,935
(tearfully): Marshall, I came in
here because it was cold

410
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,569
and this was the only
place that was open.

411
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,634
I wasn't even gonna look
Mr. Park in the eye.

412
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:16,001
And then I found out...

413
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,701
Mr. Park died.

414
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,734
Oh, my God.

415
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,768
He really is dead to me.

416
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:25,001
And if I feel this bad

417
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,901
about never making up
with Mr. Park,

418
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:31,202
a guy who meant literally nothing to me

419
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:34,801
(sobbing)

420
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:37,102
We got to go get my dad.

421
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,435
Okay.

422
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:40,402
<i>NARRATOR:
So that's how</i>

423
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:42,335
<i>on Thanksgiving 2009,</i>

424
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,801
<i>your Aunt Lily
performed a miracle.</i>

425
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,734
<i>She brought a man

426
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:50,268
Everyone.

427
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:52,035
Before we get started, Barney,

428
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:55,135
Were going to need you
on The Slapping Throne.

429
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:58,135
Slap Bet Commissioner,

430
00:16:58,135 --> 00:17:00,202
surely tying me
to a chair is a breach...

431
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Less yappin', more slappin'.

432
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:03,202
(groans)

433
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:05,368
Ted, Robin. It's two
minutes until sundown.

434
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,035
Have you guys decided
which one of you

435
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:10,068
is going to get to slap
Barney right in his face?

436
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:12,801
It's gonna be Ted.

437
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,601
What? Why me?

438
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,234
Last year, you got left at the altar.

439
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,935
You lost your job.

440
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:22,535
But you've come
such a long way since then.

441
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,802
I'm so proud of you, Ted.

442
00:17:25,802 --> 00:17:29,902
You deserve to slap someone
in his face as hard as you can.

443
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:31,702
Thanks.

444
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,368
This is the worst.

445
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,635
(clears throat)

446
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:39,635
(breathing deeply)

447
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,401
Mama!

448
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,168
No, Robin. Look...

449
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:45,935
You just went through
your own breakup, and...

450
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:48,569
while I know you and Barney
left it on good terms,

451
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,569
isn't there some part of you,

452
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,368
deep down, that wants to slap him

453
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,701
right in his face?

454
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:56,202
There is.

455
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:57,302
I know there is.

456
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:59,268
This is basically hell on Earth.

457
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,135
Oh...
All right.

458
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,835
(humming, grunting)
Oh...

459
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,202
TED:
You got this.

460
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:09,569
It hurts!

461
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,868
No. I can't do it.

462
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:13,601
I can't take this from you, Ted.

463
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:15,001
Nor I, you.

464
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,268
Oh, thank God.

465
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:17,901
So, I'd like to
make a gesture.

466
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,368
Mickey?

467
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,102
Oh, no way!

468
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,801
I'm glad you and Lily are
trying to work things out.

469
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:27,668
So, to welcome you to our little family,

470
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:30,668
I'd like to offer you this slap.

471
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:31,635
Really?

472
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:35,668
Well, I feel a little weird

473
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:39,635
I-I just met Barney,

474
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,335
But how often
do you get a chance

475
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,969
to slap someone right in his face?

476
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,501
(groaning)

477
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:51,134
Soft!

478
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:53,602
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

479
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:55,335
Oh, thank God.

480
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,502
Lily

481
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,535
I know I haven't been
much of a father to you.

482
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,235
You are kidding me.

483
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:04,735
So for all the ballet
recitals that I missed

484
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:08,069
for all the art shows that
I should've been at...

485
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,101
...for the wedding gift

486
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:13,002
that I never got a
chance to give to you...

487
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:14,802
Princess...

488
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:17,902
I give this slap to you.

489
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,702
Oh, Daddy!

490
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:20,868
No.

491
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,101
No, no, no, no.

492
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:23,468
She is the Slap Bet Commissioner.

493
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:25,234
She's supposed to remain impartial!

494
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:28,702
Slap Bet Commissioner
says it's okay.

495
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,902
This is not good.

496
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,069
Okay.

497
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,134
Please, please, please.
Let me...

498
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:34,335
Shh, shh, shh.
Let me...

499
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:37,134
Just close your eyes.
It'll be over soon.

500
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,401
Running through a meadow.

501
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:42,569
I can't do it.

502
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:44,502
Why can't I do it?

503
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:47,168
Because this slap

504
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:49,535
has done exactly what I hoped.

505
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:51,302
It's brought us all
closer together.

506
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:53,701
And it's caused us to recognize

507
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,035
both the frailty

508
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:58,535
and the greatness
in ourselves

509
00:19:58,535 --> 00:19:59,901
and each other.

510
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:01,569
Oh, give me a break.

511
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:04,968
And that is why...

512
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:09,102
there will be no slap today.

513
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:10,968
(gasps)

514
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,701
Oh, my God!

515
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:16,802
This is the best Thanksgiving...

516
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,668
That's four!

517
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:20,169
