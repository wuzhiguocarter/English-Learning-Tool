00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:03,958
<i>aways of dealing with nerves.</i>

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,801
It'll just be a few more
minutes, Mr. Stinson.

3
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,803
<i>Some people chew their nails.</i>

4
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:10,805
<i>Some people tap their feet.</i>

5
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:13,007
<i>And some people imagine
they're being interviewed</i>

6
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:15,376
<i>by renowned sportscaster
Jim Nantz.</i>

7
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:16,638
Hello, friends.

8
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:20,178
Every sport has had an icon
who transcends the game.

9
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,581
Boxing had Ali,
basketball had Jordan,

10
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:25,612
and the sport of sleeping
with random hotties

11
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:28,278
has my next guest,
Mr. Barney Stinson.

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,744
Barney, welcome.
Thanks, Jim.

13
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:31,178
Great to be back
on the show.

14
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,310
Good to have
you with us.

15
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:33,442
And, you know,
the stats,

16
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:34,909
they really speak
for themselves.

17
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,447
Over 200 women spanning
six continents,

18
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:38,852
17 nationalities,

19
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:42,454
74 sexual positions
and not a single fatty.

20
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:43,655
It's impressive.

21
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:46,194
Hey, uh, with all
these accomplishments, though,

22
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:48,730
there's one laurel
that's always eluded you.

23
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,300
Which brings us to last week.

24
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,701
What was the story there?

25
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:52,802
Buckle up, Jimbo,

26
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,839
this one's a doozy.

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,408
<i>It all started when I decided</i>

28
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,277
<i>to set myself
a little challenge.</i>

29
00:00:58,278 --> 00:01:00,379
Oh, my God.
Whoa.

30
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,748
He's calling his shot.

31
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,850
Whatever girl I'm
pointing to right now,

32
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,787
that's who I'm going
home with tonight.

33
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:07,188
And...

34
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:11,493
Play ball!

35
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:14,964
Hey.
Hey.

36
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,000
How'd the date
with Dale go?

37
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:20,137
You know, sometimes, that guy
with the horn-rimmed glasses

38
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:22,139
and the Smurfs T-shirt
is just being ironic.

39
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,673
Sometimes,

40
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,809
he is a dork
with a lazy eye

41
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,079
and a love-hate relationship
with Gargamel.

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,047
Robin, just because
a guy talks a lot

43
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,048
about a fictional character
on a first date

44
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,951
doesn't mean he's not
husband material.

45
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,085
Sasquatch isn't fictional.

46
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:37,720
That was quick.

47
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:43,591
So, night one was
pretty routine.

48
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:47,027
Jim, there is nothing routine
about the way I get down.

49
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:48,428
Respect.

50
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:50,196
Take us to night two.

51
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,897
See that hottie over there
nursing a Black Russian?

52
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:54,866
She's about to chase that
with a white American.

53
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,300
Up top!

54
00:01:57,837 --> 00:01:59,171
You know...

55
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:01,473
if you're not careful,
you're going to lose me.

56
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,877
You guys,
what should I say

57
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:06,512
when Dale calls
for a second date?

58
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:07,646
How do you know
he's going to call?

59
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:10,049
(laughs)

60
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,751
You're cute, Marshall.

61
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:15,755
But I think Mama knows
when a dude's digging the show.

62
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:18,692
I mean, he couldn't keep
his good eye off me.

63
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:19,760
TED:
Well, let him down easy.

64
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,262
People are fragile.

65
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:23,731
And sometimes, without
even meaning to,

66
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:26,734
you might rip someone's
beating heart out

67
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:29,370
and stomp on it in a
room full of 26 people

68
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,539
and a teacher's
assistant.

69
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,709
How did school
go today, Ted?

70
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,277
Something bad happened.

71
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:37,846
It was the first class
of the new semester...

72
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,614
Jamie Adamic.

73
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,383
Hi.

74
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:42,885
Brian Glow-atz.

75
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:44,487
Glau-atz?

76
00:02:44,488 --> 00:02:46,388
Hi.

77
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,726
Well done.

78
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,727
Adding a fake name
to the sign-up sheet.

79
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:53,696
That's, uh... that's
real original, guys.

80
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:55,265
You know, I'd expect

81
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:58,401
inspired minds such as yours
to be a little more mature,

82
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:00,169
and frankly, more creative.

83
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,370
I mean, seriously.

84
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:04,373
What kind of a fake name
is Cook Pu?

85
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:06,375
Here. (laughs) Come on, guys.

86
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,276
It's got to at least sound real.

87
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:10,245
Cook Pu?

88
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:11,813
Here.

89
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:13,147
Whatever happened
to the classics?

90
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:14,115
Right, you know?

91
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:15,383
Seymour Butts.

92
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:16,384
Hugh Gerection.

93
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:19,087
Those were fake names,
but Cook Pu?

94
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:20,589
(crying):
Here.

95
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,257
Cook Pu!

96
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,693
She's back here, bro.

97
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:28,263
(laughing)

98
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:29,965
All right, come on,
let me have it.

99
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,633
Bring on all the
Cook Pu jokes.

100
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,735
Oh, we're not going
to make jokes, Ted.

101
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:36,571
I mean, that girl must be
really down in the dumps.

102
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:37,872
MARSHALL:
You really...

103
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,507
smeared the Pu name.

104
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,142
You guys finished?

105
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:44,412
Are you asking us if all the Pu
is out of our system?

106
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:46,180
(laughing)

107
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:48,048
LILY:
Wow, back-to-back nights.

108
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,751
Barney is on fire.

109
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:51,852
That girl's lucky.

110
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:54,054
Barney was the best sex
I ever had.

111
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:56,189
He's the best friend
I've ever had.

112
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,858
He's everything I
want Marshall to be.

113
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,627
He's everything
I wish I could be.

114
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:02,563
I'm just assuming that's what
they say when I'm not around.

115
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,531
I buy it. You're awesome.

116
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:06,133
Now, night three.

117
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,701
Paint us a word picture.

118
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:09,904
Jim, I could tell
I was on a roll,

119
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:12,774
so I decided to mix things up
a little bit.

120
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:16,712
I think I'm going to go
small boobs tonight.

121
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,247
You're disgusting.

122
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:20,816
Lily, they're
people, too.

123
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,153
Here's your burgers.
Oh, thank you.

124
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:25,721
Thanks. TED: What,
you're not sharing?

125
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:27,757
You two always share a burger.

126
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:28,925
No, we don't.

127
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:30,660
We're not like weirdos
who share everything.

128
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:32,296
Uh, yeah, you are.
That's exactly what you are.

129
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:33,998
We're perfectly normal!

130
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,499
Guys, what's going on?

131
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,967
You know how Lily and I

132
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,669
have been looking
for new couple friends

133
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,604
ever since we lost
Robin and Barney,

134
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:42,006
and Ted and Stella,

135
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,275
and Ted and Robin,
and Ted and Victoria?

136
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:46,610
Geez, Ted, when are you going
to get your life together?

137
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:48,045
How did we end up here?

138
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,714
We went on a great
double date last night.

139
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:52,082
It... we were cool.

140
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,150
We were casual.

141
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,485
We didn't spaz out.

142
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:57,254
And then, one tiny
little detail came out

143
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,356
and the whole night
was ruined. Ruined!

144
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:00,757
(laughter)
And Joanna's toothbrush

145
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,558
flips off the side
of the sink,

146
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:05,194
hits the ceiling and falls
right into the toilet.

147
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,196
Come on.
That's... That's crazy.

148
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:10,198
Last week, the same thing
happened to our toothbrush.

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,437
<i>Our toothbrush?</i>

150
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:17,971
Yeah.

151
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,607
Like, one toothbrush?

152
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:22,109
That you both use?

153
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,844
Every day?

154
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,380
Is that weird?

155
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:28,449
ALL:
Super weird.

156
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,117
Marshall, four
out of five dentists

157
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:32,353
just threw up
in their mouths.

158
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:34,289
Hey, check it out.

159
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,524
Barney's leaving
with another girl.

160
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,758
LILY:
Wow.

161
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,427
Three girls in
three nights.

162
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,329
That's gross,
even for Barney.

163
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,397
Gross? Are you kidding?

164
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:42,865
He's on his way
to a perfect...

165
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,535
(stammering):
Don't say it!

166
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,603
You'll jinx it.

167
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:47,838
Jinx what?

168
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,840
I was on my way toward...

169
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,211
a perfect week.

170
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,155
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

171
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:08,094
The perfect week.

172
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:11,497
Seven nights, seven girls,
zero rejections.

173
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:12,731
Incredible.

174
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:15,200
I mean, it's really
like the sexual equivalent

175
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,468
of baseball's perfect game,
but even rarer.

176
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,570
Yeah.
Uh, the only player in history

177
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,439
to have ever achieved both

178
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,441
was Mustache Pete Drexell
back in 1896.

179
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:28,144
(crowd cheering,
lively organ music playing)

180
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:29,446
Now, this wasn't
the first time

181
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,281
you'd come close
to a perfect week.

182
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,515
You learned the hard way,
though-

183
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:35,918
one mistake, and it's all over.

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,320
<i>Sometimes,
a teammate makes an error.</i>

185
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,026
<i>Sometimes, one wild pitch...</i>

186
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,796
You, me, the canned food aisle
in the bodega next door.

187
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,864
<i>...leads to a walk.</i>

188
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:52,701
<i>And sometimes,
you just lose focus.</i>

189
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:56,738
<i>And that almost always leads
to a hit.</i>

190
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:59,408
But this week,
you were three for three

191
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,543
with no sign of slowing down.

192
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,345
I could do no wrong.

193
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:06,148
Wish I could say the same
for my friends.

194
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,118
Cook didn't show up
for class today.

195
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,452
I'm sorry.

196
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,187
Cook?

197
00:07:12,188 --> 00:07:15,957
Yeah, Ted, we know, like,
a ton of people named Cook.

198
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,259
Yeah.

199
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:20,128
Cook Pu.

200
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,097
(laughter, phone ringing)

201
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,932
Uh-oh, here we go.

202
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,567
The dreaded Dale call.

203
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,903
Oh. It's my mom.

204
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:31,174
She's going through some pretty
major league health stuff.

205
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:33,009
God, why won't
that guy call?

206
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,410
LILY:
Wait a minute.

207
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,580
You want him to call?

208
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,081
No! Shut up.

209
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,583
Don't you guys
have, like, a...

210
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,818
like, a toothbrush
to share or something?

211
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,421
TED: Yeah. When did you guys
even start doing that anyway?

212
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,456
Like, years ago.

213
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:47,325
You should know.
We lived with you.

214
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:48,459
Uh, yeah,
but you always

215
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,727
kept your toothbrush
in the bedroom.

216
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,064
Also weird, by
the way. LILY: No.

217
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,532
We kept it
in the bathroom.

218
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,601
No, there was only one
toothbrush in the bathroom,

219
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:57,736
and it was mine.

220
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,773
Wait.

221
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:05,744
Are you saying that,
for eight years,

222
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:09,013
all three of you
shared one toothbrush?

223
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:10,182
Oh, my God. TED: Kill me.

224
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:13,318
Kill me!
I love this so much.

225
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,123
So, you're through four nights.

226
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,425
You're over the hump.

227
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,359
Nice, Jim.

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,494
Hey, I try.
I'm no you.

229
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:24,761
(both chuckling)

230
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:28,965
But then came night five,
and with it, trouble.

231
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:32,034
Beer here.

232
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,972
Hey.

233
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:39,074
Hey.

234
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,776
How's, uh... how's Barney
doing tonight?

235
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:41,910
Cool as a cucumber.

236
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:43,511
Just like he's been all week.

237
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:44,612
Yeah? That's hard
to believe.

238
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:45,847
Why?

239
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:48,017
Apparently, this big merger
fell through last week

240
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:49,351
and Barney's
being blamed for it.

241
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:50,619
Oh, that's weird.

242
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,054
He hasn't said
anything.

243
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:53,322
Look, I work
with the guy.

244
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,856
I didn't find out
until this afternoon,

245
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:56,592
when I walked
by his boss's office.

246
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:58,260
...you cost this company,
Stinson?!

247
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:01,030
<i>I'd never seen Barney
look that scared.</i>

248
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:03,866
I... I think he's
going to get fired.

249
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:12,319
I can't believe Barney
might get fired.

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,887
Yeah, they're having
a meeting on Friday

251
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,223
to determine whether or not
he keeps his job.

252
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,325
Poor guy.
He must be freaking out.

253
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:20,362
Yeah, I'm going to go talk
to him. (stammering): No!

254
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:21,663
You can't distract a man

255
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:23,765
in the middle of a...
you-know-what.

256
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:25,366
Oh, come on,
this is his career.

257
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,202
This is much more important
than some stupid perfect...

258
00:09:28,203 --> 00:09:29,303
Ah!

259
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:31,038
O- Okay.

260
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,307
You can lick my hand
as long as you want.

261
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:36,144
I'm not going to let you
ruin his... Ow!

262
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:38,145
Guys, we need
to talk to him.

263
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:39,381
I'll go.

264
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,182
He needs a bro.

265
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,486
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

266
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:45,620
Everything all right?

267
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:47,122
Absolutely. Sure.

268
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:48,523
Top of the world.

269
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:49,691
(sighs)

270
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,159
Who am I kidding?

271
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,560
I need your help.

272
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,595
Anything, buddy.

273
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,863
What is it?

274
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,598
(sighs)

275
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,967
Which one of these girls
looks the dumbest?

276
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,569
All right, kid.

277
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,938
Let's check
the scouting report.

278
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,708
What about the heater?

279
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,415
High and outside?

280
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,719
All right.

281
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,155
I'd go with the slider.

282
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,126
Thanks, Skip.

283
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,862
Yep.

284
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,667
So, what did he say?

285
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:35,268
Hmm? Oh!
Yeah, he's going

286
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,438
to take a swat at the
Hamburglar over there.

287
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,140
You were supposed
to talk

288
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:41,309
to him about
losing his job.

289
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,877
Lily, how is forcing him
to dwell on a problem

290
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,378
he can do nothing about
going to help him?

291
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:46,847
How is ignoring it going
to solve anything?

292
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:47,882
Well, you ignored
good dental hygiene

293
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:49,149
for the better
part of a decade,

294
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,318
and you seem to
be doing just...

295
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:52,086
Cook Pu! (giggling): Cook Pu.

296
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:54,622
Dale call yet?
Why do you got to...

297
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:56,290
Guys, guys, guys, look!

298
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,462
Barney, I'm going to
stop you for a second.

299
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,764
There's something I have to ask.

300
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,332
Have you ever used

301
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,901
performance-enhancing drugs?

302
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,535
No, sir.

303
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,571
I respect the game too much.

304
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:13,442
Although, I can't say
I haven't been offered.

305
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:18,714
Dude, it was pretty awesome.

306
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:20,950
You should try it.

307
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:22,051
I have, I have some more.

308
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:23,385
No, thanks.

309
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:24,887
You sure?

310
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:27,789
All right, suit yourself.

311
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,192
What time is it?

312
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:32,060
It's, uh, 8:00.
8:00?

313
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:41,903
I need to go to the hospital.

314
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,009
I'd never touch the stuff.

315
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,010
You can test me if
you want, Jim Nantz.

316
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,379
Barney, I trust you.

317
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,114
I regret I even asked you
the question.

318
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:53,282
Okay, let's go to night six.

319
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:56,152
Two girls away from perfection.

320
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:58,422
(chattering) Hey! Hey.

321
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:00,690
Dude, what are you doing here?
Get down to the bar!

322
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:02,526
Ted, relax.

323
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,627
I'm already six for six.

324
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,295
Really?
Yeah.

325
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:07,530
I was lunching
at Tavern on the Green,

326
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,933
I started chatting up
this Swedish supermodel.

327
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,467
Next thing you know,
I'm playing a day game

328
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:13,736
in the back of
a horse-drawn carriage.

329
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:16,372
Giddy-what-up?!

330
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:17,940
(neighing)

331
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:20,143
(splutters and stomps)

332
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:21,344
Awesome.

333
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:22,478
What really happened?

334
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,513
I had lunch
at a Staten Island Chili's

335
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:25,781
and banged a drunk hairdresser.

336
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:27,216
Are you happy, Truthy McGee?

337
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:34,723
Barney, we know
you might get fired.

338
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:37,660
Wait, you have to
talk about this.

339
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:40,262
You are just using
meaningless sex

340
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:42,764
to distract yourself from
a really serious issue.

341
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:44,566
It is not meaningless, okay?

342
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:47,669
Number five and I
really connected.

343
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,103
She's going back to school.

344
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:52,974
Or has a kid in school-
something about school!

345
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,577
So, today one of
my students told me

346
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,245
Cook is dropping my class.

347
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:02,149
Oh, my God, Pu dropped out?

348
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,985
She is flushing her
education down the toilet!

349
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:06,220
Any word from Dale?

350
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:08,556
It's only been five days,
he's gonna call!

351
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:09,790
Why do you care anyway?

352
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,925
You said he was a total dork.

353
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,927
Do not talk
about Dale that way, okay?

354
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:15,763
He is twice the man
you will ever be!

355
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:18,866
God forbid, if you can't find
another job, sell your place.

356
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,901
Marshall and I have
an extra room.

357
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:22,937
You can stay there as
long as you need.

358
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:25,039
Make sure you bring
your own toothbrush.

359
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,774
Lily, what are you doing?

360
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:29,477
Talking to my friend who's going
through a really tough time.

361
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:31,178
He's doing fine.

362
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:34,014
Trying to sleep with seven
women in seven nights

363
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:37,450
is not "doing fine"
it's a cry for help.

364
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,151
Barney's whole life
is a cry for help.

365
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,352
But you don't mess with a man

366
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,620
when he's in the middle
of a perf...

367
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,921
What?

368
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,122
Perfect week?

369
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,423
(all gasp)

370
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,492
Oh, perfect week, perfect week,
perfect week!

371
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,461
Grow up!

372
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,030
(hissing)

373
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,365
Unbelievable.

374
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,400
You know, there's two
things you don't do.

375
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,236
One: you don't open an e-mail
from Phil Simms

376
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,637
in front of your kids.

377
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:02,207
And two: you don't jinx a man
going for a perfect week.

378
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,375
I don't know what to tell you.

379
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,543
Lily's always messing with me.

380
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,045
I think she has a thing
for the Barnacle.

381
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,181
You're a keen observer

382
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,417
of the human condition,
Jim Nantz.

383
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,054
I can't believe
you jinxed him.

384
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:15,389
He doesn't stand
a chance out there.

385
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,556
LILY:
Okay, question:

386
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,158
If I ruined everything,

387
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,594
why is Barney totally
hitting it off

388
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:22,663
with Third Martini
Girl over there?

389
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:25,099
Oh, my God!

390
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,067
He's going to do it!
Yeah. See?

391
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:29,303
There is no such
thing as a jinx.

392
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:30,270
(gasps)

393
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,438
Tell me she didn't say,

394
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:33,240
"There's no such thing
as a jinx."

395
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:34,307
Wish I could.

396
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,742
You were about to achieve

397
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,110
something so beautiful!

398
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:38,878
Well, well, thanks to her,

399
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,414
the only thing that could ruin
a surefire hookup

400
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,683
was about to walk
through that door.

401
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:50,056
<i>A member of the 2009</i>

402
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,493
<i>World Champion
New York Yankees.</i>

403
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,436
Lily, I'm getting
my own toothbrush.

404
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,196
Well, I guess that's it.

405
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:11,232
Barney's streak
ends at six.

406
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,467
What?! Why?!

407
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:14,670
Because that guy with the
weird hair just walked in?

408
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:17,239
That's Nick Swisher.

409
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,475
He's a New York Yankee.

410
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:22,545
No normal guy in New York City
can compete with a Yankee.

411
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,580
And it doesn't even have
to be a current Yankee.

412
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:25,715
When I first moved here,

413
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,117
I was on a fourth date
with a girl I really liked,

414
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:29,485
until I got rack-jacked
by Phil Rizzuto.

415
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:30,452
I was there.

416
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,254
Holy cow, that guy
had game. Mm-hmm.

417
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,355
I'm not seeing it.

418
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,590
Okay, let me try to Canada
this up for you, eh?

419
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,758
How would you react

420
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,760
if one of those
Ca-chuck guys

421
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:42,996
with the skates and the
sticks walked in here?

422
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:46,699
Lily, if one of the Vancouver
Canucks walked in here,

423
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,701
my panties would
drop so hard,

424
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:50,803
there'd be a hole in the
floor halfway to China.

425
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,238
That's what it's like
with the Yankees.

426
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,274
Well, Barney's screwed.

427
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,776
It's happening! Look.

428
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,110
Hey! Want to come over

429
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,980
and look at my snow
globe collection?

430
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,248
Snow globe collection?

431
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:03,117
He's throwing junk
out there.

432
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,655
<i>That is Nick Swisher!</i>

433
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:08,956
(all groan)
Good effort.

434
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:11,292
Good game, good game, good game,
good game, good game.

435
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,927
Not good enough.

436
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:16,130
This whole week was a waste.

437
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,868
And tomorrow,
I'm going to get fired.

438
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,005
I'm really sorry, dude.

439
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:28,041
But for what it's worth,
this week wasn't a waste.

440
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:31,311
We were all having
a really horrible week

441
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:33,347
and you took
our minds off it.

442
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:35,583
Yeah, I had my first student
drop my class- it sucked.

443
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,985
I met my soul mate and
he never called me back.

444
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,854
I mean yet. He will.

445
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,957
(voice breaking):
He will.

446
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,959
We scared off
a really great couple

447
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,861
just because we share
a toothbrush.

448
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:48,297
You share a toothbrush?!

449
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,065
Well, them and Ted.

450
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:50,865
Wha...?

451
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,367
Wait a second.

452
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:55,504
When we were dating, you borrowed
that toothbrush all the time.

453
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:57,372
Oh, my God.

454
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,141
<i>NARRATOR: And that's
when Aunt Lily realized</i>

455
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,676
<i>what's great about sports:</i>

456
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:03,845
<i>They take your mind off your
troubles, if only for a moment.</i>

457
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:07,482
<i>And deep down, we all needed
that perfect week.</i>

458
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:12,320
The second she sits down next
to Swisher, it's all over.

459
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:16,490
Wait a minute!

460
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:18,893
MARSHALL:
Aldrin's got a bead on her!

461
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,633
She's running
out of room.

462
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:27,035
She dives, and...

463
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:28,203
(thud)

464
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:30,106
I have no idea where
she's going with this.

465
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,074
Oh, my God, are-are
you okay? Yeah. Oh.

466
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,077
Sorry. I'm such a klutz!

467
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:35,479
Oh, thanks. Ow!

468
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,513
Oh, I...

469
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,881
think I twisted my ankle.

470
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:39,183
Can you get me some ice?

471
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,017
Of course.

472
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,652
Oh, my God,
she did it!

473
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:45,089
I guess- I guess there is
no such thing as a jinx!

474
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,363
Oh, I'll get you
some ice, Lily.

475
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,365
MARSHALL:
Damn it.

476
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,466
Swisher's back
in play!

477
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:56,567
Swisher's back in play!

478
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:57,635
Follow me.

479
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,470
Hey, Nick Swisher!

480
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:01,538
This guy and his wife
share a toothbrush!

481
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,806
So?

482
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:05,809
So, that's weird, right?

483
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,578
Actually, I think
it's kind of sweet.

484
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,781
In a way, aren't we all trying
to find that special someone

485
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,849
to share a toothbrush with?

486
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,718
Excuse me.

487
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,586
Lily, Nick Swisher
thinks we're sweet.

488
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:21,090
Martini?

489
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,425
We're having a beer
with a New York Yankee.

490
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:24,927
How cool is that?

491
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:25,961
It's amazing.

492
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:27,762
I totally follow baseball.

493
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:30,065
Mookie Wilson, is that a thing?

494
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,033
Yeah, baseball, it's amazing.

495
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,636
But I tell you one thing,
it's no hockey.

496
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:39,440
I live right upstairs.

497
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:42,009
What do you say we go back
to my place?

498
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,244
(sultry laughter)

499
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:46,447
Wow, to be honest,
I don't normally do that,

500
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:49,349
but I feel a real
connection here,

501
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,084
seven- Christy.

502
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:57,123
Please.

503
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:00,626
I did it!

504
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:02,528
(all cheering)

505
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:03,529
I did...

506
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,731
(laughing)

507
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:10,035
Amazing!

508
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:12,504
Congratulations on
your perfect week!

509
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:13,704
Thanks, Jim.

510
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:15,373
I couldn't have done it
without my teammates.

511
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:16,707
Hey, on to a new topic.

512
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,509
Do you really think
you might get fired today?

513
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,445
Um, uh, Jim,

514
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:24,547
I- I-I told you I don't want
to talk about that.

515
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:27,616
Barney, I'm a figment
of your imagination,

516
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,619
so apparently you do.

517
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,321
Think about that.

518
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:35,458
What a jerk.
You're a jerk.

519
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:40,730
Mr. Donovan will
see you now.

520
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:44,867
Stinson, we've reached
a decision.

521
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,838
We're keeping you on.

522
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,673
(sighs)

523
00:19:50,674 --> 00:19:53,309
I know this past week
must have been tough on you.

524
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,677
(chuckles)

525
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:57,412
I barely slept.

526
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,513
Here you go, guys.

527
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:01,750
The official hat
of Barney's perfect week.

528
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:02,918
I was going to
do shirts,

529
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,753
but then you have
to guess sizes.

530
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:06,621
And feelings get hurt.
It's a mess.

531
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,156
In commemoration

532
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:12,693
of Barney's induction into
the Hall of Game, this tie,

533
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:15,061
worn on the seventh night
of his perfect week,

534
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:17,030
is hereby retired.

535
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,799
May Barney's heroic
