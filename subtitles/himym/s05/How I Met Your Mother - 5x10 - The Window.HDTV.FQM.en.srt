1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,560
Well, got another one.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,570
Oh, boy.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,670
What's in the box?

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,170
What's in the box?

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,870
What's in the box?!

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,630
What's in the box?!

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,510
Right?

8
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,750
Brad pitt? Seven?

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,890
Nothing?

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,130
Yeah, I'm the jerk.

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,610
What's in the box?

12
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,100
Well, ever since marshall and lily got their own place,

13
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,500
His mom keeps sending them boxes

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,260
Of his old stuff she's trying to get rid of.

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,550
Thanks, mom.

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,130
You really nailed it this time.

17
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,700
I really needed he-man's right arm

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,230
And this old book of mad libs.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,840
"fart went to the fart to fart fartly."

20
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,350
That's nice.

21
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,210
That's good stuff.

22
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,260
That's good.

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,700
Thanks, mom.

24
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,230
Hello.

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,260
Hello?

26
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,440
- Ted mosby? - Yeah.

27
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,670
The window is open.

28
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,760
The what?

29
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,300
The window is open.

30
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,380
The window is open.

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,840
What are you waiting for?

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,020
- I... - Run, ted, run!

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,670
Lily, the window is open.

34
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,310
Make a hole, people.

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,570
Run, ted, run!

36
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,370
- Ted? - Hey.

37
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,480
- Hey. - Maggie.

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,480
I was just, um,

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,780
You know...

40
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,130
How are you?

41
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,400
Um, I'm fine, I guess.

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,480
Actually, no, I'm not fine.

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,120
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,040
I'm so sorry to hear that.

45
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,460
No, it's...

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,180
You want to hang out tonight?

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,620
Sure.

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,710
- It was so fun. You guys liked it. - It was the most...

49
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,840
Please tell me you got in the window.

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,970
I got in the window.

51
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,990
- Yes! - what is going on?

52
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,090
What is the window?

53
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,860
You know how everyone has that guy

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,280
Or girl who, no matter what happens,

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,970
You always remember them being the perfect one for you?

56
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,300
My chaps.

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,920
Lily.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,380
That girl right over there.

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,300
Well, that girl for me was

60
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,000
and still is-- maggie wilks.

61
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,540
We all went to college together.

62
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,360
She was awesome.

63
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,750
Everybody loved her.

64
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,530
I think I know what we're dealing with here.

65
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,000
Tell me when to stop.

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,540
It wasn't that maggie was hot.

67
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,890
She was...

68
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,050
She was the ultimate girl next door.

69
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,100
She was the ultimate girl next door.

70
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,890
Still is.

71
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,170
I mean, every guy who meets maggie

72
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,380
Falls madly in love with her.

73
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,610
And that's the problem.

74
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,660
Since I've known her, she's only been single

75
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,150
For, like, three brief windows of opportunity.

76
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,480
When she moved here and broke up

77
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,760
With her college boyfriend, I waited a month.

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,850
You know, so I wouldn't be the rebound guy.

79
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,360
Well, the rebound guy lasted two years.

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,950
After they broke up, I only waited a week.

81
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,650
I was still too late.

82
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,190
She dated that guy for three years.

83
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,200
The next time, I wasn't messing around.

84
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,180
I was at her door

85
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,530
Not one hour after they broke up.

86
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,980
The only thing she did

87
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,480
Between becoming single

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,770
And the moment I got there

89
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,510
Was go downstairs and check her mail.

90
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,660
I was still too late.

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,790
And she dated that guy for four years.

92
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,080
I wasn't going to let this happen again,

93
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,150
So I begged her neighbor, mrs. Douglas,

94
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,290
To call me the second she and david broke up.

95
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
And now, a very single

96
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,160
And available maggie wilks

97
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,970
Is on her way to this very spot.

98
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,530
I sent a cab with a female driver,

99
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,620
so she'd have no other interaction with a man

100
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,360
until she got to me.

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,410
Where she will still have no interaction with a man.

102
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,500
What up?

103
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,860
I feel good tonight.

104
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,950
Tonight's going to be good.

105
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,990
Oh, hell, yeah!

106
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,450
It's my overalls.

107
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,240
I wore these babies all throughout high school.

108
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
These were my jam.

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
God, you really were a virgin

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,150
Before you met lily, weren't you?

111
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,280
Well, that's unnecessary.

112
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,830
Oh, she's right, baby.

113
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,020
If... If you had worn these things in college,

114
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,630
Even I wouldn't have slept with you.

115
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,590
And, if you recall, I was good to go.

116
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,000
No one, I mean no one.

117
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,490
Could get laid wearing these.

118
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,780
Challenge accepted.

119
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,150
I, barney stinson,

120
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,740
Being of sound mind and amazing body,

121
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,920
Will wear these overalls until I have sex with a woman.

122
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,840
I actually dated that guy.

123
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,770
Okay. Quick game plan.

124
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,340
Maggie shows up, couple minutes of hugs and hi's,

125
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,690
And then everybody's out of here.

126
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,030
This is my one shot.

127
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,170
I am not gonna screw this up.

128
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,930
Who'd you get to cover your class tonight?

129
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,610
- Crap! - oh, my god!

130
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,340
Oh, my goodness.

131
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,450
- Hey, stranger. - Hey.

132
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,270
- Maggie, this is my roommate, robin. - Hey.

133
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,790
- Hey. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.

134
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,170
Um, I totally forgot, I have to teach a class tonight.

135
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,820
Hey! want to come with me

136
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,100
And check out a real live architecture class?

137
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,950
Ooh. Not even a little bit.

138
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,620
Uh, you know, I'll just hang here with marshall.

139
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,780
- It'll be fun. - Fantastic.

140
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,990
Okay. Well, have a seat.

141
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,690
Relax. Yeah.

142
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,250
Yeah, this is casual.

143
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,740
This is all very, very, very casual.

144
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,860
Listen to me. You want me to find the perfect girl

145
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,990
So we can all grow old together?

146
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,290
That is her.

147
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,420
Do not let any guy near her, okay?

148
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,880
That means no waiter takes her order,

149
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,260
No busboy clears her table.

150
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,690
If she bursts into flames,

151
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,010
I want a fire woman putting her out.

152
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,330
I don't think 911 takes requests.

153
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,140
Damn it, marshall!

154
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,180
Whatever you have to do,

155
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,900
Keep maggie wilks single until I get back.

156
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,420
I left my tab open.

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,080
Don't abuse it.

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,450
Target secure?

159
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,910
Target secure.

160
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,370
Oh, my gosh. How weird.

161
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,940
We all walked out of the bathroom at the same time.

162
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,190
Well, let's all walk back to the booth together.

163
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,280
Oh, my. Look at this-- the table where we are sitting.

164
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,200
Back off!

165
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,540
Okay, um, not that I care about this challenge,

166
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,160
But it's cheating to wear overalls over a suit.

167
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,020
No, it's not.

168
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,700
They're not called over t-shirts, robin.

169
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,750
They're not called over shirtless fat guys

170
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,170
Who used to come fix my mom's car

171
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,950
And then hang out with her upstairs for a little while.

172
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,100
No. They're called overalls, okay?

173
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,470
And I can wear them over whatever I want.

174
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,350
He's not saying hello

175
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,280
He's just telling you what he feeds his horses.

176
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,130
Oh, man, I can sit here

177
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,630
and make you-look-like-a-farmer jokes All night.

178
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,370
Challenge accepted.

179
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,140
Good evening.

180
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,870
Tonight, we're gonna have a nice, quick class on bridges.

181
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,220
There are six types of bridges.

182
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,980
Beam, cantilever, arch, suspension, and two others.

183
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,610
You got land on both sides, water in the middle.

184
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,490
See you all next week.

185
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,170
Hey, we get you for the whole hour.

186
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,910
Oh, come on. I mean, who really wants to sit here

187
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,960
And listen to me yap about bridges for an hour?

188
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,330
Really?

189
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,750
I just thought about how awesome ted is again.

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,030
This is a weird drinking game.

191
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,330
Can I buy you a drink?

192
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,090
He's got a big brown jug with three x's on it.

193
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,690
What have I done?

194
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,680
One very important thing to keep in mind

195
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,860
When designing a bridge...

196
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,010
Maggie?

197
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,970
Oh, no.

198
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,500
I mean, yes.

199
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,980
Yes, when you are designing a bridge, always remenber

200
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,950
Make adjustments... ...Go get it energized.

201
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,480
That's good advice for life, too.

202
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,810
So, professor mosby,

203
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,890
Is this maggie someone special?

204
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,780
No. I...

205
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,500
She's just this girl I've been into for a really long time,

206
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,670
And, well, tonight could be

207
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,810
The one chance I have to go out with her, so...

208
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,230
Is she a hottie?

209
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,750
Yes, jamie. She's very attractive.

210
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,450
And if we can just end class right now...

211
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,870
Betty?

212
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,410
Maggie may finally be available,

213
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,470
But what about you, professor mosby?

214
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,960
Are you ready for a serious relationship?

215
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,350
Totally.

216
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,690
I mean, I think so.

217
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,250
Maybe.

218
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,440
I don't know. What do you guys think?

219
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,430
Oh, my gosh. I totally forgot about this.

220
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,310
What is it?

221
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,390
It's a homework assignment

222
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,590
From when I was 15.

223
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,040
Um, write a letter to your 30-year-old self

224
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,930
With a list of goals you hope to achieve.

225
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,270
Dear future me.

226
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,980
First off, you'd better be driving either

227
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,490
A kick-ass camaro or the a-team van.

228
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,400
That's priority numero uno.

229
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,560
And by now your rat tail

230
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,730
Should hang down to your freakin' knees.

231
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
You can still slam-dunk, obviously,

232
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,320
And you've legally changed your name to "vanilla thunder."

233
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,170
Your wife, let me break it down

234
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,300
Blonde, six feet tall,

235
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,770
Has an awesome rack and caters to your every need.

236
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,750
- Sorry, babe. - That's okay.

237
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,450
You just described your mother.

238
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,460
Keep going.

239
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,360
You're still rocking...

240
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,090
You're still rocking the stone-washed overalls,

241
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,190
Because this look is working.

242
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,970
Oh, and most importantly,

243
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,930
You'd better be saving the world.

244
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,450
If you became some lame, corporate sellout,

245
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,900
Just throw yourself off a cliff

246
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,830
Because you suck.

247
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,430
And I licky boom-boom down.

248
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,870
Snow me I'll go blame

249
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,510
A licky boom-boom down...

250
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,300
Yeah, hilarious.

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,660
I became a lame, corporate sellout.

252
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,050
I work for GNB,

253
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,900
The most evil bank in the history of the world.

254
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,320
Oh, come on, vanilla thunder,

255
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,230
Everyone's got to grow up and get a real job.

256
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,230
Yeah, I remember back in college Maggie wanted to be

257
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,520
A marine biologist by day and mentor

258
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,460
Inner-city kids by night.

259
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,650
What did you really end up doing?

260
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,920
Those things.

261
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,080
Baby, where are you going?

262
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,330
I just gotta, I gotta do something at work.

263
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,420
It won't take long.

264
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,060
What's up with Marshall?

265
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,690
Oh, no.

266
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,940
I think he's going to quit his job.

267
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,050
I'm sorry, Maggie. I gotta go stop him.

268
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
Ted, I had to leave the bar, but it's okay.

269
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,280
I left Maggie with Robin.

270
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,340
You left Maggie with Robin?

271
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,670
Relax.

272
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,740
I've got things under control.

273
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,110
You don't understand the situation.

274
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,430
This girl is like a super-powered man magnet.

275
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,420
Oh, Teddy.

276
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,950
I know a little something about man magnets.

277
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,430
You see, your friend may be one of those magnets

278
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,010
That can hold up a picture of your kids on the fridge,

279
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,510
But I'm one of those magnets

280
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,330
That can pick up cars in a junkyard.

281
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,090
- Who's this?  - Robin,

282
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,890
This is Jim, a good friend of mine from work.

283
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,710
Oh, well, hello there.

284
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,460
Nice to meet you.

285
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,570
Oh, boy.

286
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,300
What does being "ready" even mean?

287
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,840
I mean, I thought I was "ready" last year.

288
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,630
I wound up getting left at the altar.

289
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,010
I'll be honest, guys.

290
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,030
I'm a little scared.

291
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,960
Okay, Louis, then Betty.

292
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,170
We're all scared, professor Mosby.

293
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,600
Doesn't being scared let you know

294
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,710
you're on to something important?

295
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,960
Yeah.

296
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,030
I mean, if you're not scared, you're not taking a chance.

297
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,400
And if you're not taking a chance,

298
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,120
Then what the hell are you doing?

299
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,650
Right?

300
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,050
I think you're ready, bro.

301
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,520
Jim, you are so funny.

302
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,550
Funny? I think he's hilarious.

303
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,240
In fact, I laughed so hard,

304
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,930
I think I may have just peed my pants.

305
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,830
I'd better take off.

306
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,970
I'm going to the opening of that photography

307
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,440
Exhibit]  that they were talking by the work

308
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,130
Les chiens erotiques.

309
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,970
- I have an extra ticket if you want to...  - Me?!

310
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,070
I'd love to!

311
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,060
All right, I gotta go.

312
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,340
One last piece of advice.

313
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,140
Make adjustments...

314
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,100
Go get it energized!

315
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,360
Hello?

316
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,960
Ted, change of plans.

317
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,220
You left her with Barney?!

318
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,320
Ted, will you take it easy?

319
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,530
I'm your bro.

320
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,710
You're an animal.

321
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,870
And even though our bro-lationship

322
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,890
Has suffered its setbacks in this area,

323
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,200
I assure you I will be the perfect gentleman.

324
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,890
Oh, thanks.

325
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,330
By the way, I really like those overalls.

326
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,260
You have ten minutes to get down

327
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,420
here or the window's closing.

328
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,100
- Ten minutes? - Yeah.

329
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,040
Because we're bros.

330
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,800
While I was racing through the streets of New York,

331
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,030
Trying to get back to the bar,

332
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,730
Your aunt Robin was doing her best

333
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,200
To keep Jim away from Maggie.

334
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,670
Do you want to go back to the bar

335
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,660
and see if Maggie's still there?

336
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,300
Oh, no way!

337
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,410
I love erotic dog photography.

338
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,580
Did you see the one over there

339
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,250
Of the corgies doing it people style?

340
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,710
I'll get us a taxi.

341
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,650
I just feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.

342
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,610
No! Uh, let's have a glass of wine first.

343
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,760
Oh, man.

344
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,440
Oh, look how filthy I am.

345
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I am just a...

346
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,720
A filthy, filthy girl who would totally

347
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,790
Go to second base with a guy as a favor to a friend.

348
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,510
You like that?

349
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,190
I'm going to call Maggie, see what she's doing.

350
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,990
Oh, god! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

351
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,580
Give it a rest, jeez!

352
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,840
She's hanging out with Ted tonight.

353
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,820
Ted? What about David?

354
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,970
They broke up.

355
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,330
Maggie's single?

356
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,250
That doesn't sound familiar.

357
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,970
Can I help wipe that off?

358
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,160
Please?

359
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,410
I hate Barney.Stinson!

360
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,380
Me, too!

361
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,920
Lily finally got to GNB,

362
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,390
But the place was deserted.

363
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,800
Hey, baby.

364
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,910
I thought you came here to quit your job.

365
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,080
I forgot about the hoop.

366
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,670
Yeah. I-I thought if I could just do one thing

367
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,450
In that letter, I wouldn't feel like such an old sellout,

368
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,060
So I came out here to dunk.

369
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,620
Did it make you feel better?

370
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,710
I barely grazed the bottom of the net,

371
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,150
And now my legs hurt so bad, I can't even fall down.

372
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,620
How could you?!

373
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,250
Ted, I challenged myself

374
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,770
To get laid wearing overalls.

375
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,110
And if you stand in my way, then you're letting Barney win.

376
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,170
And you don't want that. That smug son of a bitch will

377
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,850
Never let us hear the end of it.

378
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,990
Oh, thank god. Maggie...

379
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,930
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Where do you think you're going?

380
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,000
To tell that girl I love her.

381
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,210
- Get in line, bub. - Yeah.

382
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,810
I'm going to have sex with her, then he's

383
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,890
Going to tell her he's in love with her, and then you can do

384
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,190
Whatever you want. Do we agree on the order?

385
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,380
Mister!

386
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,410
You missed just out on the night of your life.

387
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,090
The night of your life.

388
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,820
I've been in love with her for five years.

389
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,770
I've been in love with her for 12 years.

390
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,150
I've been in these overalls for an hour and a half.

391
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,340
Maybe you can't dunk anymore.

392
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,390
But you've achieved

393
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,110
More in your 30 years than that

394
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,930
15-year-old dweeb could ever dream of.

395
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,720
You put yourself

396
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,040
Through Columbia law school.

397
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,890
You had the sense to chop off that stupid rat tail.

398
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,610
And you married a smoking-hot chick

399
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,730
Who looks nothing like your mother.

400
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,300
I think that earns you

401
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,200
An entire foot closer to dunking.

402
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,730
There you go, vanilla thunder.

403
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,560
Step back.

404
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,530
Oh, baby.

405
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,830
How about instead of dunking, we go up to your office,

406
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,480
And you lie very still while I go bananas all over you?

407
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,360
Could we maybe instead just do it right here?

408
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,460
Sure, baby.

409
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,760
- She loves me! - But I chose her! - Guys! Guys!

410
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,680
Guys, we have to figure this out.

411
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,830
We are dealing with a very small window of opportunity here.

412
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,740
Guys, let me assure you, if you let me in there,

413
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,370
That window's gonna open up again in, like, ten minutes.

414
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,590
Wait, where's maggie?

415
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
- She's gone. -What? - I sent her home.

416
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,800
You guys were like vultures fighting over her.

417
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,020
Let her be single for once.

418
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,800
- Jealous bitch! - Robin, how could you?!

419
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,130
No, she's right.

420
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,080
Maggie deserves some time to herself.

421
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,620
Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup,

422
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,760
But that's when we discover who we really are

423
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,750
And... And what we really want.

424
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,590
She deserves that.

425
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,450
And kids, I meant that.

426
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,110
Which is why I'm not proud of what happened next.

427
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,460
It's around the corner. Around the corner.

428
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,270
Hey. Maggie, sorry.

429
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,570
Class ran a little...

430
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,040
Who's this?

431
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,680
This is Adam.

432
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,330
It's so crazy.

433
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,760
We grew up next door to each other.

434
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,570
God, we haven't seen each other since...

435
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,330
- A long time. - Yeah.

436
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,130
And then Maggie Wilks told us

437
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,260
The second-greatest love story I've ever heard.

438
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,060
I just moved to town and I had to look her up.

439
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,440
I guess we've got a lot of catching up to do.

440
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,140
Yeah.

441
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,780
Yeah, of course.

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,770
So, kids, I missed out on the ultimate girl next door

443
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,910
To the guy next door.

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,870
See you next time.

445
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,300
There was no "next time."

446
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,000
Maggie's window never opened again.

447
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,740
Hey! Hey, I got it!

448
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,200
That country bar, giddy-ups!

449
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,770
The overalls have gotta work there.

450
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,460
Wingman me?

451
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,500
I don't want giddy-ups.

452
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,520
I want that.

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,120
I forgot what it feels like to chase the real thing,

454
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,100
But... I think I'm ready again.

455
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,800
Yeah.

456
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,980
Let me tell you where I'm at.

457
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,980
I want to have sex with a girl

458
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,490
So I can take off these overalls.

459
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,720
Come on. Come on!

460
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,150
Ted, you gotta help me!

461
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,780
I gotta get these damn things off!

462
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,030
Hey there.

463
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,270
I just love your overalls.

464
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,380
Dear 60-year-old Marshall.

465
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,470
By now you should be working somewhere

466
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,870
That's making the world a better place,

467
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,840
Or at least trying to.

468
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,280
No pressure, dude. I mean, sir.

469
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,900
Also, if time travel is possible,

470
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Maybe you could give me a little sign

471
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,700
On Tuesday, December 8, at 8:29 P.M.

472
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,320
So, someone sent back these chicken wings,

473
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,430
Because they were too hot. And I'm like,

474
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,340
"Too hot? Are you crazy?"

475
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
So, free wings.

476
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,990
Old man Marshall,

477
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,800
As long as you're still married to Lily,

478
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,390
You're doing just fine.

479
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,970
Sir, this is on us.

480
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,160
Sorry the wings were so hot.

481
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,030
Oh, no, dear. It wasn't that they were too hot.

482
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,790
It's just that I had wings earlier.

483
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,880
Much earlier.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
