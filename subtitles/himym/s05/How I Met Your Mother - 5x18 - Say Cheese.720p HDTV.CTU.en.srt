1
00:00:01,244 --> 00:00:03,712
<i>Lily has always
been one of those people</i>

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,671
<i>who loves their birthday.
Loves it.</i>

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,557
It's my birthday!

4
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:15,723
<i>So it's a good thing
she married Marshall.</i>

5
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:19,617
It's still my birthday!

6
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:23,605
<i>Because he loves planning birthdays.</i>

7
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:26,483
<i>Feliz cumpleaños, baby.</i>

8
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:30,026
The theme of this today's
birthday breakfast in bed is...

9
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:32,559
"Spanish Interlude"

10
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:37,286
And...

11
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,916
How on Earth did we end up

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,624
in the lyrical rolling hills
of Northern Spain?

13
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,628
Baby, tonight is going
to be so much fun.

14
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:49,854
Just the five of us, black-tie dinner,
and Ted is picking up

15
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,259
your favorite cognac pumpkin
cheesecake from Edgar's.

16
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,972
Okay, I am off to run your super secret
birthday errand.

17
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:03,103
And I'm taking this guy with me because
I don't like how he's looking at you.

18
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,152
A new camera!

19
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,612
Thank you, Marshall.
I love it!

20
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,256
Well, little bonus:

21
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,960
I took some naked pictures
of myself before I wrapped it.

22
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,201
Put a bow on it.

23
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:18,853
There wasn't a bow on it.

24
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:20,422
Wrong "it."

25
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,068
Thank you, honey. I'm going to get some
great shots of our little group with.

26
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:30,240
<i>Now, kids, you've seen your Aunt Lily's
photo albums: leather bound,</i>

27
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,966
<i>acid free paper,</i>

28
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:34,472
<i>adorable handwritten captions.</i>

29
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,291
<i>And most importantly,
the group shot.</i>

30
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:38,988
<i>Cute photo, right, kids?</i>

31
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:40,688
<i>What you don't see is what happened</i>

32
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,835
<i>ten seconds
before this picture was taken.</i>

33
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,356
I want to get
the perfect group shot.

34
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,533
Marshall, sit between
Barney and Robin.

35
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:48,658
Why?

36
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,695
You know, light,

37
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,630
color, balance, aperture...

38
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:55,709
You're just saying camera words.
Wait, you don't want Barney and me

39
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:57,699
to look like a couple
in this picture, do you?

40
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:00,213
Of course I don't!
You two aren't going to last!

41
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:03,127
- I'm going for timeless here.
- How dare you?

42
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,666
- That is so rude!
- It's true.

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,705
Totally true, we're running
on fumes here, but still rude.

44
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:12,122
<i>We hated Lily's group shots.</i>

45
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,963
Okay, maybe I get a little bossy,

46
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:18,162
but I just want
to remember those times.

47
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,590
Like tonight.

48
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:22,099
I can't imagine
a better birthday than,

49
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,419
than being here with just
my four best friends.

50
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:28,623
And Ted's here now.

51
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:35,358
Happy birthday!
This is Amanda.

52
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:38,291
And Amanda...

53
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,982
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-,
Jojo13

54
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,226
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

55
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,127
Ted, you were supposed
to bring a cheesecake,

56
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:59,428
but instead you brought two grocery bags
and a woman we've never seen before.

57
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:01,432
Hi. I'm Marshall.
Welcome to our home.

58
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,556
Start talking.

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,892
Amanda's going to make
Lily a cake. She's a chef.

60
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,683
We met when I was at a restaurant
last week and I sent some soup back.

61
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:12,968
Lucky, she's got such pretty hair
I didn't mind eating a little bit of it.

62
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,901
They call me "The Shedder" at work.

63
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm so glad you're
making my birthday cake!

64
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,819
In honor of Lily's 32nd birthday,

65
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:24,856
I've got a lot of great games
planned, starting with...

66
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,122
"Lil-ial Pursuit."

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,650
Okay, who's got number one?

68
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,598
I do.

69
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,861
Of course you do.
Okay, Amanda goes first.

70
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,158
32 seconds on the clock

71
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,852
to answer as many questions
as possible.

72
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,161
And...

73
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:43,388
Go! Question one:
What is Lily's favorite color?

74
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:47,339
Well, she's wearing pink,
so I'm going to say pink.

75
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:49,121
That's Robin.

76
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:51,897
Her...

77
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,384
favorite color is...

78
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,552
elbow.

79
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,988
I believe Ted was mouthing
the word "yellow."

80
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,736
Which also would have been wrong.

81
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,895
This game is called

82
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,581
"Gilding The Lily."

83
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,178
- Nice.
- Thank you.

84
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:14,503
You've all written down your favorite
things about the birthday girl.

85
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,156
And Lilypad,
you guess who wrote what.

86
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,884
"Lily makes everyone in her life,
from her friends to her students..."

87
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:23,470
She's a kindergarten teacher
that's what he means by that.

88
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:27,265
"... feel loved. She makes the best
oatmeal raisin cookies ever,

89
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,184
can recite
every line from Goonies..."

90
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:31,822
She saw Goonies in the theater
right after her parents separated.

91
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:34,549
After that,
she had real trouble trusting people...

92
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:38,276
"She's the strongest person
I've ever met.

93
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:40,778
"I can't imagine
my life without her.

94
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,223
I love you, Lily."

95
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,201
Of course it was me.

96
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:47,828
That's so sweet.

97
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:51,886
Lily, you try to guess
who wrote this.

98
00:04:58,516 --> 00:04:59,907
"You seem really nice."

99
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:03,927
I'm going to guess Amanda.

100
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,413
That was me.

101
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,023
And I meant every word.

102
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,984
Well, I should get back
to that cake.

103
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,228
Let me know if you need anything.

104
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,178
Quick!
Let's do the photo!

105
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:19,860
Everybody around the fireplace.

106
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:22,182
Hang on, I'll let Amanda know.

107
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:25,552
That's okay. She's busy in the kitchen.
Let's not bother her. Come on.

108
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,409
Hang on a second.
You...

109
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,854
You don't want Amanda in the photo.

110
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,327
It's just, you know,
auto-focus, shutter speed, zoom...

111
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,189
Lily, what's going on?

112
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,864
Who wants a party hat?

113
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:40,500
Look, I'm a bird!

114
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,402
Let's all be birds.

115
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:43,967
Tell me the truth.

116
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,123
Of course not. I'm not going
to let another one of your dumb skanks

117
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,048
ruin my precious memories.

118
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,829
Lily, what are you talking about?

119
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:00,265
Ted, you always do this.

120
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,096
You bring girls that we barely know
to all our big group events.

121
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,904
- I do not.
- Really?

122
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:08,409
Well, let's just take a little walk

123
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,709
down Random Skank Lane.

124
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,578
Or, we could just keep on
a-strolling down

125
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:15,206
Best Birthday Ever Avenue.

126
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,293
Do I get a vote?
Skank Lane! Skank Lane!

127
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:21,043
Guys, I've composed a song
for the evening.

128
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,364
Follow along.
The chorus goes like this:

129
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,508
<i>Happy, happy Lily day!</i>

130
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,762
Christmas morning, four years ago.

131
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:32,364
<i>Our first Christmas together,
just the five of us.</i>

132
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:35,787
Here's
another fun little trivia game.

133
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,229
It's called <i>Name That Bitch</i>.

134
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,736
It is San...

135
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,077
Wrong. You're thinking of Santa,
'cause it was Christmas.

136
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,649
Fun fact, each year,
my mother has Easter tea

137
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,369
with her friend Bunny.

138
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,537
Not that fun.

139
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,499
I remember her name.
It's Sarah.

140
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:59,334
Close.
It's Leilani.

141
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,185
She just had to come to Christmas
because you said,

142
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,255
"Guys, she might be the one."

143
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:06,174
And she's not the only

144
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,860
"might be the one."

145
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:10,833
<i>New Year's Eve, 2007.</i>

146
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,134
<i>Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall</i>

147
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,059
<i>and "She's the One" Emily.</i>

148
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,892
<i>Robin's Uncle Cecil's funeral.</i>

149
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:20,717
<i>Marshall, Lily,
Robin, Barney, Ted and...</i>

150
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:24,916
<i>"this just proves you find the one
when you're not looking" Isabel.</i>

151
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,718
<i>My appendix surgery.</i>

152
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:29,493
<i>Robin, Marshall,
Barney, Lily, Ted, and...</i>

153
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,784
<i>Well, this one you admitted
you were just trying to bang.</i>

154
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,020
Respect.

155
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:37,815
Remember this yoga instructor
you brought to my last birthday?

156
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,058
<i>... you!</i>

157
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:40,568
Thanks.

158
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,461
You won't believe who just came in.

159
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,021
Don't look!

160
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:48,717
Why aren't you looking?
It's Slash from Guns N' Roses!

161
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:52,887
Group shot!

162
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,145
And we got it.

163
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,450
We got a picture with Slash
on my birthday.

164
00:07:58,575 --> 00:07:59,825
Awesome, right?

165
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,188
We know how this ends.

166
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:03,606
Wrong!

167
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:07,895
<i>You know what's funny about it?
He was grabbing my ass.</i>

168
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,953
<i>- Really? He was grabbing my ass, too.
- He was grabbing my ass, too.</i>

169
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:12,532
How many hands does he have?

170
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,727
No wonder
he's such a good guitarist.

171
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,495
I'm sorry dude,
I thought that you were Lily.

172
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,789
Wait, look at these pictures again.

173
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,189
<i>Barney has the same pose
in each shot</i>

174
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,514
<i>and these are, like, years apart.</i>

175
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,070
Yes, about that,

176
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:33,318
I never take a bad picture.

177
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:35,096
Never have, never will.

178
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,016
There has to be
a bad picture of you.

179
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:39,291
Not one.

180
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,270
The elementary school?
Everyone has bad pictures from school.

181
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:43,563
Not the Barnacle.

182
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:47,358
<i>I always look</i>

183
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,668
drop dead, stone cold amazing.

184
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,114
Unlike Marshall,
who just looks dead, stoned and cold.

185
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,234
<i>He was right, kids.
Marshall does a lot of things well,</i>

186
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,756
<i>but he does not take a good picture.</i>

187
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,711
They're not all bad, okay?
Like...

188
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:07,452
Here, look at this one.
My eyes are open.

189
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,340
You did put a bow on it.

190
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:11,575
Chip and dip?

191
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:12,743
Sure.

192
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:16,824
Got it!
A bad picture.

193
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:18,973
Is it though?

194
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,463
Wait!
You were eating a chip!

195
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,314
Where's the chip?

196
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:29,809
It is physically impossible for me
to take a bad picture.

197
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,819
I don't know why.
Ask God.

198
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,414
I'm sorry about Amanda.
I'm going to say it.

199
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:38,284
You are being a birthday brat.

200
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:42,372
You're all bent out of shape just 'cause
you think I ruined a couple pictures.

201
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,166
These girls have ruined

202
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:46,876
so many events,

203
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:50,129
or are you forgetting Paris?

204
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:51,589
What happened in Paris?

205
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,778
It was junior year
and I was studying abroad in Paris,

206
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:56,719
and I hadn't seen Marshall
for two months.

207
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:58,103
Two months.

208
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:00,338
And I had just started having sex.

209
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:02,725
I wasn't ready
to stop for two months.

210
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:05,645
And Marshall was coming
to visit over spring break.

211
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,213
And at the last minute,

212
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,146
Ted decided to come

213
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:13,291
with the girl he had just
gotten back together with, Karen.

214
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:14,908
Karen.

215
00:10:15,752 --> 00:10:17,699
I am so excited you're here.

216
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,742
I'm so excited to go to Paris.

217
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:21,741
I'm so excited to have sex again.

218
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,010
But just before
the plane took off...

219
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:26,194
Wait,

220
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:27,959
I want to tell you something.

221
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,050
Really?

222
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,296
'Cause I think I want to tell you
the same thing.

223
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,543
Is your thing, I had sex with
my philosophy professor last night?

224
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:37,010
'Cause that's my thing.

225
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,229
And thus began the longest seven
and a half hours of Marshall's life.

226
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,904
- When I picked them up at the airport.
- Ted broke up with me.

227
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,032
I need to sleep in your room
this week.

228
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:00,700
Marshall can bunk with Ted.

229
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,234
Two months!

230
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,484
My balls were bleu! Bleu!

231
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:13,062
This will come as no shock,

232
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:15,278
but the rest of the trip
was terrible.

233
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:26,746
And all I wanted was
a romantic kiss picture

234
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,492
in front of the Eiffel Tower,

235
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:30,437
which I actually did get.

236
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:34,070
It just happened to be between
Karen and Francois,

237
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,074
our waiter from the day before.

238
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,699
Wow, that's just awful.

239
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:39,602
Just...

240
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,731
Oopsies! I dropped my phone.

241
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:43,594
- You picking it up for me?
- Sure.

242
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:45,161
Smile, you son of a bitch!

243
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:46,290
Got it!

244
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:48,748
Did you, though?

245
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,629
Wait. How do you do that?
You weren't even standing up!

246
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:56,260
The camera loves me, Robin.

247
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,499
More than loves me.
The camera lusts after me.

248
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,897
The camera wants to put
on some nice lingerie,

249
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:02,468
pop in an Al Green CD,

250
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:04,639
dim the lights and do all the work
while I lie

251
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,343
there with my eyes closed.

252
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,601
I'm sorry about Paris and

253
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,308
all the ruined group shots,

254
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:11,808
but when you're single,

255
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,542
you got to hope that each next new girl
is the one.

256
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:17,616
- Erin. Irene. And Sarah.
- Emily. Or Isabel.

257
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,932
It's Leilani.
What is wrong with you?

258
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,382
At the time, yes, I thought each
of these girls could be the one,

259
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,827
but I got to stay hopeful.
What's the alternative?

260
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:27,706
Here's the alternative.
How about

261
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,664
no more random skanks
at my birthday!

262
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:32,375
Hey, sweetie!

263
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,627
Do you guys have a cooling rack?

264
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:37,964
Drawer under the oven.
Can't wait. You're just the best!

265
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,427
Ted, I'm sorry.
I gonna have to agree with Lily on this.

266
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,886
These kind of events

267
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:47,015
are hard for a new person.
That's why I didn't bring Don tonight.

268
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:48,975
When I lived in Japan,

269
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:52,516
this guy, for our third date,
brought me to his brother's wedding.

270
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,785
Now, I a total stranger,

271
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,985
am in that Japanese couple's wedding
picture for all eternity.

272
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:06,993
Yeah, Ted,
I think you should listen to Robin.

273
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:09,787
Right, right, 'cause...
'cause Robin's your best friend.

274
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,107
- Exactly.
- Your best friend in the whole world.

275
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,898
- Absolutely.
- Careful, Lily. It's a trap.

276
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:17,170
And before she was your best friend,
what was she?

277
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,847
Oh, that's right.

278
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,923
One of my random skanks.

279
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:23,183
Yes, Ted.

280
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:24,800
This particular skank...

281
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:28,140
... happened to work out,
but she's the skanky exception,

282
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,933
- not the skanky rule.
- I'm crying a little bit.

283
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,398
Hey, guys, that about wraps up
this whole skank conversation.

284
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,357
Let's get back to the birthday song!

285
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,943
Barney, your part goes like this.

286
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:43,626
She's cute.

287
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:46,333
She's cute.

288
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:48,946
She's cute.

289
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,620
I bring girls
to these events because

290
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:55,750
you guys are important to me.
You're my family.

291
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,643
Your part goes like this.

292
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,952
And nice.

293
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,967
And nice.

294
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:07,178
And also nice!

295
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,071
Yes. We're a family.

296
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:13,210
So why can't these events
ever just be us?

297
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:17,058
Like the time we celebrated
Marshall passing the bar exam.

298
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,231
Hey, guys.

299
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,983
This is the disgusting,
smelly hippie I'm dating.

300
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,861
I did not say that!

301
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,472
You might as well have.

302
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:26,709
Hey, guys.

303
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:28,116
This is Strawberry.

304
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,446
Should we order more food?

305
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,411
No, Strawberry's not eating.

306
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,332
I'm a vegetarian.

307
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,118
Let's all raise a glass.

308
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:43,400
For the last three years,

309
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,486
Marshall has been working so hard,

310
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,959
and I am so proud of you.

311
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,460
Meat is murder!

312
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:53,822
I admit it.

313
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:56,843
Strawberry was a mistake.
How could I have known that going in?

314
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:59,403
Her name was Strawberry.

315
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,177
If it's a big deal, Amanda doesn't have
to be in the photo.

316
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,269
But I promise she's not gonna ruin
your birthday. Just give her a chance.

317
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,599
See, look, guys.
We're all friends again!

318
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:10,550
Now let's work on those harmonies.

319
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,193
Happy happy Lily day!

320
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,160
Happy happy Lily day...

321
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,450
All done.

322
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,450
I hope you like it.

323
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,864
"Happy 42nd birthday,

324
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,094
" Lori."

325
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:33,696
Kids, you know how I've told you about
Lily's "you're dead to me" look.

326
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:37,165
That expression she gets just before
she explodes in white-hot rage?

327
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:38,231
Well,

328
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,720
this wasn't it.

329
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:46,555
But this was Marshall's.

330
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:48,243
"42nd"?

331
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,022
Does this

332
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,485
hot piece of ass look 42 to you?

333
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,348
Or!

334
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:54,485
Or

335
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,157
does she look like her name is Lori?

336
00:15:57,282 --> 00:16:00,032
- No, Marshall, it's okay.
- No, Lily, it's not okay. Ted,

337
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,055
get this stranger out of my house!

338
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,785
I am so sorry.

339
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:04,704
Out!

340
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:22,304
Happy, happy Lily day.

341
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,556
Happy, happy Lily day

342
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:31,239
Well...

343
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,476
Amanda refused to come back.
She thinks you guys hate her.

344
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:36,252
Marshall, you have to go apologize.

345
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:39,023
You ruin Lily's birthday

346
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,730
and you want me to apologize?

347
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:43,259
If anything,
you should apologize to me.

348
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:44,835
What are you talking about?

349
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:47,312
Ted, you bring girls
to these intimate events

350
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,491
it makes them think
that things are serious.

351
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:52,051
And then when you break up with them,
you know who they turn to?

352
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:55,729
Me. I've been
your girlfriend cleanup crew for years.

353
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:57,740
February, 2005.

354
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:01,396
I had just come back from a marathon
study session at the law library.

355
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,230
Hey, Natalie, where's, where's Ted?

356
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,743
We broke up...

357
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:07,770
again!

358
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:13,091
Won't you sit with me for
a little while?

359
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,146
Just sit?

360
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,077
Man, you know what?
I've been up for, like, 36 hours.

361
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,082
Just for a few minutes.

362
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,159
And at first,
I was completely sympathetic.

363
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,460
But damn it, Ted, over the years,
you made me cynical.

364
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,356
You know what?
I'm going to go get us some Rocky Road,

365
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,418
and we're just going to sit here
and talk it out until it makes sense.

366
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:44,594
I just thought
we had something so special,

367
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:45,742
you know?

368
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,027
Me, too. Yeah.

369
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:51,074
But, you know,
life goes on, sweetheart.

370
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,987
I don't know how I'm going
to put my life back together after this.

371
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,733
Oh, shut up.

372
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,737
I'm sorry my search for true love
has been such an inconvenience

373
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,436
to you guys.
You know what?

374
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:06,876
Maybe your precious pictures would look
a lot better if I wasn't in them.

375
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,420
Look better if Marshall
weren't in them. Cheap shot.

376
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:10,838
Cheap shot.

377
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,027
You know what these pictures are, Lily?
They're a big, fat lie.

378
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,115
They're posed.

379
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,970
They're touched up. They're what you
want our life to be, not what it is.

380
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:19,958
- That's not true!
- Oh, yeah?

381
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,142
Look at this one.
Halloween, two years ago.

382
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,103
You got in a fight 'cause
you didn't want to dress up as penguins.

383
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:29,438
It's not just that she didn't want to.
It's that she called penguins "lame."

384
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:30,692
Penguins.

385
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,605
And yet, here you are,
smiling like nothing's wrong,

386
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,196
completely phony.

387
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,764
Robin's birthday, three years ago.

388
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,994
Robin had a cold and you made her change
out of her pajama's for the picture.

389
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,830
And then you pinched my cheeks
to get some color in them.

390
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:46,685
Yeah, but you look pretty.

391
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:50,211
And then,
we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.

392
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,964
- Actually, that was a nice night.
- Yeah, it was.

393
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,632
Yeah, I guess it was.

394
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,987
Hey, look at this one.

395
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,806
This is the first picture the three
of us ever took together.

396
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:03,315
That's right. It was.

397
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:05,692
Yeah, you remember how it happened?

398
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:07,431
Okay, ready?

399
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:08,437
Wait.

400
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,783
What pose should we do?
Buddy cop picture?

401
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,827
What about, '80s sitcom

402
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:17,275
about two roommates
who never agree on anything?

403
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:18,447
Nice.

404
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,685
Okay, one, two...

405
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,079
Hi, Marshall.
Ready for the movie?

406
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,326
Yeah. Just a second though, okay?
We're about to make history.

407
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:30,963
We're about to take
our first ever roommate picture.

408
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:33,170
Why don't you get in the picture,
too?

409
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:34,296
Really?

410
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,402
What you doing, Ted?

411
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,676
- What if we break up?
- What if you don't?

412
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:41,429
Come on.

413
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,596
I forgot all about that.

414
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:50,455
Marshall and I had just been dating
a few weeks

415
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,725
and you invited me into the picture.

416
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,104
I liked you.

417
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,535
- We have to get Amanda back.
- Really?

418
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,055
Ted, you believed in me.

419
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,965
It's my turn to believe in you.

420
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,238
For all I know, she's the one.

421
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,870
Thanks, Lil.

422
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,984
I think Lori's age
has made her very wise.

423
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:12,465
They say your forties are when
you really get to know yourself.

424
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,963
So, your Aunt Lily called Amanda.

425
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:17,965
All right, people, gather around.

426
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,448
Let's make a memory.

427
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:21,967
Okay, Marshall.
Marshall, try this.

428
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:24,486
Keep your eyes closed
until the last second,

429
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:26,348
and when I say so, open them.

430
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,854
- Barney, it's a hole in your jacket?
- What? Where?

431
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:31,870
Now, Marshall!

432
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,049
Damn it!

433
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,118
Name that bitch.

434
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,881
Birth... a?

435
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:43,954
Bertha?

436
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,034
No, it was my birthday.

437
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:49,168
Your brain makes associations
in a very obvious way.

438
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:50,711
All right, people.

439
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:52,892
Gather around.
Let's make a memory.

440
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:56,314
What's in this dip you made?

441
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,966
'Cause it tastes like...

442
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,325
cilantro.

443
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,204
And

444
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:02,982
you know that cilantro makes me...

445
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,490
Yes!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
