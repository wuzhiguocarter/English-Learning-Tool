1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,379
<i>It was the Fall of 2009
and I was a professor now.</i>

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,445
{\pos(192,220)}<i>So I decided to change
my look a little bit.</i>

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,320
{\pos(192,220)}<i>And people were noticing.</i>

4
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:10,385
{\pos(192,220)}Tweed.

5
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,821
Textile of the eunuch.

6
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:16,349
I've always wondered why those
tweed jackets have elbow patches.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,059
Because the people who wear them
are constantly going,

8
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:21,311
"Geez. Why can I get laid?"

9
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:25,315
You are wrong.
The ladies dig the professor look.

10
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,025
There is something to that.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,322
I remember thinking my tenth grade
math teacher was very sexy.

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,198
I wonder if Harold's still in jail.

13
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:34,950
What?

14
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:36,524
Tax evasion.

15
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,997
Among other things.

16
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:43,596
So guys, Marshall and I wanted
to invite you to our place

17
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,420
for a little couples' night.

18
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:47,755
Sure. Why not?

19
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:51,013
<i>For years, Marshall and Lily
had been the only married couple</i>

20
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:52,719
<i>in a group full of single people.</i>

21
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,591
<i>It got lonely.</i>

22
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:57,891
<i>So they were always searching
for another couple to double-date.</i>

23
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,693
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

24
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:01,318
- Welcome.
- Gouda?

25
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:03,365
<i>They sucked at it.</i>

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,816
This is great. We're having fun.
You're having fun, right?

27
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:10,672
So, should we just go ahead

28
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:13,030
and lock the four of us in
for new year's?

29
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,990
It's april.

30
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,897
Right. Sorry.

31
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:19,868
We're getting ahead of ourselves.
Let's talk Thanksgiving.

32
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:22,293
Our parents really want to meet you!

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,838
Well, we should probably be going.

34
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,051
Wait. But, wait, if you leave now,
Colonel Mustard just gets away with it.

35
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,266
It's getting pretty late.
We're going to go.

36
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:36,553
There's still pie.

37
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:42,017
Tonight was fantastic.
We should do it again.

38
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,284
I'm sorry, Marshall

39
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:47,209
but Falguni and I
are just not that into you.

40
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:48,505
And you.

41
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,070
<i>But just when Lily and Marshall
were about to give up,</i>

42
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:55,388
{\pos(192,220)}<i>two of their best friends
in the world got together.</i>

43
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:57,713
<i>And hope returned to their hearts.</i>

44
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,118
<i>So when Lily said...</i>

45
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,624
Marshall and I wanted to invite you to
our place for a little couples' night.

46
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:06,968
Sure, why not?

47
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>Barney and Robin had no idea
what they were about to walk into.</i>

48
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,590
Okay. Game time.
Let's review the flow of the room.

49
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,964
Barney and Robin enter here,

50
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:19,313
stop here for margaritas.
That's a great conversation starter.

51
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,266
We can tell them about
our trip to Cabo.

52
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,416
Great, cause I got that story
about Sammy Hagar

53
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,311
and the Belgian waffle
locked and loaded.

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,106
Then we'll move on to the
hot apps station. And,

55
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,442
depending on how things are going,

56
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,652
some lively pre-dinner charades.

57
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,320
Right, but...
we'll play that one by...

58
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,074
Sounds like?

59
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,964
Okay, you can be Robin's partner.

60
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:44,873
Baby, we can do this.

61
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,269
- Welcome.
- Gouda?

62
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,557
<i>Meanwhile, my half-baked theory
that ladies dig the professor look</i>

63
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:56,431
<i>was actually proving to be true.</i>

64
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:58,058
So is it hard to grade papers?

65
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,344
You've just got to make it fun.
For example...

66
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:03,368
every time I spot a grammatical error,
I do a shot.

67
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:06,853
I'm trashed right now
and I blame our public school system.

68
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,565
<i>Sometimes things just seem
to magically fall into place.</i>

69
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:13,192
So, you said
you live right upstairs?

70
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:15,278
<i>Whether it's in the dating world...</i>

71
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,446
Take care.

72
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,071
<i>... or the double-dating world.</i>

73
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:21,993
- Nailed it!
- Best night ever!

74
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,812
Worst night ever.

How was the big couples'
night with Marshall and Lily?

81
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,852
- Brutal.
- Really? How?

82
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,163
{\pos(192,220)}It was like we were
on a date with a sad,

83
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:52,190
{\pos(192,220)}chubby girl our mom made us call.

84
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,901
{\pos(192,220)}And they were so nervous,

85
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,430
{\pos(192,220)}that they weren't even
making sense half of the time.

86
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,946
{\pos(192,220)}Come on in.
Would you like a margarita?

87
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,532
In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar
eating a Belgian waffle!

88
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,162
{\pos(192,210)}And they kept shoving platters
of food in our faces.

89
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:10,457
{\pos(192,230)}Let me guess, did Marshall get, like,
super intense about the cheese?

90
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,369
{\pos(192,230)}- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Poor Marshall.

91
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:15,983
{\pos(192,230)}Lily's this gourmet cook,
and all she lets Marshall do is

92
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:18,173
{\pos(192,210)}pick out one sad block of cheese.

93
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,384
That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.

94
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,720
You guys are going to want
to get in on this gouda.

95
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,180
{\pos(192,210)}That's seared scallops
with a mango chutney.

96
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,573
Seriously, don't sleep on the gouda.

97
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:30,352
And that's lobster ravioli
in a black truffle oil.

98
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:32,824
{\pos(192,190)}Tick-tock goes the gouda clock.

99
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,746
{\pos(192,210)}We didn't realize
there was gonna be dinner.

100
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:39,028
{\pos(192,210)}We sucked down
a couple tacos outside the subway.

101
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,033
{\pos(192,210)}PS, not sitting great.

102
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,119
{\pos(192,210)}And if anything didn't go according
to plan, they would freak out.

103
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,998
{\pos(192,210)}What do you mean,
the egg timer is broken?

104
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,307
What are we going to use
for charades, sweetie?

105
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:54,710
{\pos(192,210)}I'm working on it, darling.
Okay? Just stall them.

106
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,076
Now, Robin...

107
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,114
{\pos(192,210)}You work in television.
We're experiencing some

108
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:02,593
{\pos(192,210)}technical difficulties.
You get that?

109
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,382
{\pos(192,210)}We're still laughing.
Right? Laugh, Marshall.

110
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,437
Come on, they just got excited.

111
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:16,043
{\pos(192,210)}They've been looking for couple
best friends forever.

112
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:18,516
{\pos(192,210)}Plus, I'm sure
they weren't that bad.

113
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:19,777
Show him.

114
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,838
{\pos(192,210)}This is a web site Marshall
already made about last night.

115
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:28,709
{\pos(192,210)}It's called:
itwasthebestnightever.com.

116
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,294
<i>It was the best night ever</i>

117
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:39,217
<i>Laughter raining down
like April showers</i>

118
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,353
<i>We talked for hours...</i>

119
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:48,514
- <i>Best night ever</i>
- That's not good.

120
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,341
<i>Then we played charades</i>

121
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,742
<i>Lily made some creme brulee...</i>

122
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,986
<i>And now that we're
best couple friends</i>

123
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,861
<i>There's only one thing</i>

124
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,873
<i>Left to say...</i>

125
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,748
<i>Are you free?...</i>

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,751
<i>Are you free next Saturday?</i>

127
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,071
- That's the 17th.
- <i>Are you free?</i>

128
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,764
Friday or Sunday would also work.

129
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,739
Or basically any other day.

130
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,869
Needless to say, we've both
changed our e-mail addresses.

131
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:23,507
I don't understand.
If last night went so horribly,

132
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,932
why do Lily and Marshall
think it was such a hit?

133
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,912
We knew we were gonna have fun tonight
but we had no idea how much.

134
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:32,628
Tough luck, every Saturday night
I've ever had,

135
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:34,780
cause this one just
blew you out of the water.

136
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:37,062
- Let's do it again, soon.
- Yeah, we'll call you.

137
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:41,024
They're your friends! Why would you
just blatantly lie to them like that?

138
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,568
That's what you say
at the end of a crappy date.

139
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,299
Great time last night.

140
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,958
Let's do it again, soon.
I'll call you.

141
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:51,941
Right?

142
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,737
- Who was that?
- I don't want to brag, but

143
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:58,667
it seems chicks are really digging
the whole professor thing.

144
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,214
Last night,
she picked me up at the bar.

145
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,389
And then...

146
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:06,799
She actually wound up falling asleep
on the couch. But, hey,

147
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,083
that happens.

148
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:11,702
- No, it doesn't.
- Sure, it does.

149
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:15,142
You know, she was just exhausted
from being turned on.

150
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,052
But you heard her.
She wants to do it again, soon.

151
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,091
Ted, let me ask you a question.

152
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,234
Where does this girl live, exactly?

153
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,002
Westchester. Why?

154
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:32,075
- You're the Sexless Innkeeper.
- Oh, my God! You're right!

155
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,127
He's totally the Sexless Innkeeper!

156
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,496
What the hell is
"the Sexless Innkeeper"?

157
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,507
Many a man...
nay, many a soul...

158
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,401
has their own tale of
the Sexless Innkeeper.

159
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:45,176
Why, I had run-in
with one just last year.

160
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:47,401
I even composed a poem about it.

161
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,461
- Would you care to hear it?
- Not really.

162
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:53,336
"It was the night before new year's
and the weather grew mean.

163
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,979
It was 3:00 in the morning
and I was stranded in queens."

164
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:00,469
<i>"The tavern grew empty,</i>

165
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:02,344
<i>the gas lights grew dim."</i>

166
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:05,892
<i>"The horse-drawn carriages
were all but snowed in..."</i>

167
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,600
Wait. If this was last year,

168
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,894
why are you acting like
it was Oliver Twist?

169
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,581
It's a poem.

170
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,101
<i>"Last call was approaching</i>

171
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,259
<i>and my fortunes looked bleak."</i>

172
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,453
<i>"Then I turned to my left</i>

173
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:21,178
<i>and stifled a shriek."</i>

174
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:24,265
<i>"She had a peach fuzz beard</i>

175
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,526
<i>and weighed 16 stone."</i>

176
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:28,955
<i>"She gobbled up hot wings</i>

177
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,199
<i>and swallowed the bones."</i>

178
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,117
<i>"I muffled a scream</i>

179
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,051
<i>and threw up in my mouth."</i>

180
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:37,746
<i>I asked,</i> "Where do you live?"

181
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:40,558
<i>And she said,</i> "One block south."

182
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,302
<i>"I swallowed my pride</i>

183
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,013
<i>and six shots of whiskey."</i>

184
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,928
<i>"And prayed to the gods</i>

185
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:52,992
<i>that she wasn't too frisky."</i>

186
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,625
{\pos(192,210)}<i>"Back in her cave,
she prepared us a snack."</i>

187
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:02,145
<i>"Neath her mighty hooves,
the floorboards did crack."</i>

188
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,990
<i>"But when she returned,</i>

189
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:07,212
<i>she found a sound sleeper."</i>

190
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,798
<i>"And thus she became</i>

191
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,345
<i>the Sexless Innkeeper."</i>

192
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,636
And so are you

193
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:18,097
Wait, you're saying that girl
just used me for a place to crash?

194
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,764
Ted, you mentioned that
you live right upstairs.

195
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:23,597
She saw the tweed jacket
which basically says

196
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:27,557
you're not interested in, nor probably
even capable of, having sex.

197
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:30,082
And she thought,
"Hey, free lodging."

198
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,450
No way.

199
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,696
I'm not the Sexless Innkeeper.

200
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:37,579
That girl had no intention
of ever hooking up with you.

201
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,800
Which is funny, because usually

202
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:42,622
it's the Innkeeper
who offers turndown service.

203
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,003
Hey, guys. Good news.

204
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:50,171
First of all, you can ignore all the
e-mails and texts we've sent you.

205
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,709
We have. Go on.

206
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,861
Because we went ahead and booked

207
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:56,095
that couples weekend
for all of us in Vermont!

208
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,517
Wait, you guys were
serious about that?

209
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:02,392
We never joke about B&B's, especially
at the height of syrup season.

210
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,803
Saturday we've got apple-picking,
antiquing, then

211
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,543
a hanted hay ride.

212
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:11,483
And then on Sunday, we're up
at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike.

213
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:14,690
Now, you better pack your long Johns,
cause it is cold up there.

214
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,023
I'm sorry that we have been
dodging your calls

215
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,322
but we respect you guys
too much as friends

216
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:24,318
to give you some song and dance.
You deserve the truth.

217
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:32,054
The US Navy has found
intelligent alien life

218
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,029
at the bottom of the ocean.

219
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:36,108
For reasons I can't explain,

220
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,095
Robin and I have been tapped
to lead the expedition.

221
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,212
That kind of sounds like
the stuff you say to girls

222
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:45,601
when you're too much
of a coward to dump them.

223
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,100
You know, that's exactly
what it sounds like.

224
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,314
But if that's true, that's awesome.

225
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,107
What's going on?

226
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:56,572
Look, all the couple-y stuff,
it's just not us.

227
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,824
Barney and I are barely equipped
to date each other, let alone you guys.

228
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:02,744
Plus, the alien thing.

229
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:05,971
- Come on, Marshall. Let's go.
- Let's go.

230
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:08,246
- No... Lily...
- You know what?

231
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:11,436
I hope those underwater aliens
are cold-blooded.

232
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:15,089
Cause then you guys will
get along just fine.

233
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:22,388
I think they bought it.

234
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,567
I can't believe they
broke up with us.

235
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,042
We're so lovable.

236
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,452
No, we're not.
We're ugly and gross.

237
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,401
- I thought we did everything right.
- I know!

238
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,192
I know. We had the gouda.

239
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:40,698
We had my waffle story. I even sent
them a awesome photo montage.

240
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,470
Nothing.

241
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:45,631
Oh, dear God.

242
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,270
Marshall, we've been
over and over this.

243
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:51,995
You have to stop
sending those to people.

244
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,520
<i>It was true.</i>

245
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,820
<i>Marshall had become addicted
to creating songs</i>

246
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:58,717
<i>and photo montage is documenting
various mundane events.</i>

247
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:01,142
<i>So for months,
all of Marshall's friends and</i>

248
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,679
<i>professional colleagues
were getting e-mails like this...</i>

249
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,535
<i>Ordered Chinese food today</i>

250
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,123
<i>Some moo shu pork sauce got away</i>

251
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,896
<i>Flipped the cushion</i>

252
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:15,667
<i>Now everything's okay.</i>

253
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:22,089
<i>Cat-sitting for Lily's mom</i>

254
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:25,398
<i>Cat-sitting for Lily's mom</i>

255
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:27,602
<i>It's gonna be fun</i>

256
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:30,817
<i>It's gonna bring us all
closer together.</i>

257
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,767
<i>Cat funeral...</i>

258
00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:39,188
<i>Cat funeral...</i>

259
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,735
<i>It was an accident</i>

260
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:47,120
<i>And not entirely my fault</i>

261
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,961
<i>Cat funeral...</i>

262
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,224
<i>We'll miss you, Whiskers.</i>

263
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,366
I can't believe you sent them
one of those.

264
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,409
They think we're insane now.

265
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,205
If I recall, they didn't dump us until
you brought up that Vermont trip.

266
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:14,435
It was way too early.
First, a boat ride around the city,

267
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,837
then a trip to Vermont. It's a rookie
mistake, and you're better than that.

268
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:21,549
What about you forgetting to check
the egg timer for charades?

269
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,922
I gave you one thing to do,
Marshall. One thing.

270
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:26,664
One thing?

271
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,274
One thing?

272
00:13:30,654 --> 00:13:31,504
Really?

273
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:34,152
I guess that gouda

274
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:37,022
just walked itself
right through the door...

275
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:39,976
sliced itself up,

276
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:43,951
and arranged itself
in a perfect semi-circle

277
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,659
around not three,

278
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,825
not four...

279
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:49,685
but five

280
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:53,415
different kinds of sturdy,
cheese-bearing crackers?

281
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,626
You're a sturdy,
cheese-bearing cracker!

282
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:02,353
Lily and Marshall haven't been
to the bar all week.

283
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:04,072
They're taking this really hard.

284
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:06,292
I could listen to this
guilt trip all day,

285
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,470
but don't you have to
get back up to the inn?

286
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,393
Who's working the front desk?

287
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:13,642
Seriously, they're your friends.
You got to go apologize.

288
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,640
To your point, Ted,

289
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,772
as an innkeeper,
do you do that cheapy thing

290
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,790
where you only change
the linens upon request?

291
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:25,320
How much water
is that actually saving?

292
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:28,579
Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring
a problem doesn't make it go away.

293
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,371
Usually, it just makes it bigger.

294
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:31,966
- You're right.
- Thank you.

295
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:34,329
All that sexlessness
has made you wise.

296
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:35,979
For God's sake!

297
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:37,458
Mint on the pillow!

298
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,710
And don't charge for wi-fi.
It seems greedy!

299
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,803
<i>But eventually,
even Barney and Robin had to admit</i>

300
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,051
<i>they owed Lily and Marshall
an apology.</i>

301
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,513
We wanted to say we're sorry.

302
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:53,849
I wish you had called.

303
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:57,686
I swear, he was right there
just eating a Belgian waffle!

304
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:03,066
He can't have enjoyed it as much
as I'm enjoying this gouda!

305
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,071
Listen...
Now's not a good time.

306
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:08,614
We'll call you.

307
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:10,365
Wait, we just want...

308
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,544
- Long time no see.
- Have a seat.

309
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:23,796
{\pos(192,210)}We can't.
We're here with Py and Shea.

310
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:27,161
{\pos(192,210)}It's just... we haven't seen
you guys all week.

311
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,586
{\pos(192,210)}Maybe all six of us could hang out.

312
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,650
It might be weird.
We're kind of on a double date.

313
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:35,934
Wouldn't want you to feel
like a fifth and sixth wheel.

314
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,187
Who the hell are these people?

315
00:15:38,883 --> 00:15:40,655
They just moved here from Hawaii.

316
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,230
Py is a total foodie
and Shea, well...

317
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:44,973
She's...

318
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,262
Shea... Shea is just...

319
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,938
Anyhoo, we can't stay long.
We're just gonna grab a quick beer

320
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:58,373
and then take these kooks
for a boat ride around the city.

321
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,667
It sounds like this is
getting pretty serious.

322
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,153
we don't want to jinx it, but...

323
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,214
We kind of think
they might be the two.

324
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:14,053
- Who needs 'em?
- Not us.

325
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,628
<i>Livin alone</i>

326
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:29,628
<i>We think of all the friends
we've known</i>

327
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,426
<i>But when we dial the telephone</i>

328
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:39,785
<i>Nobody's home</i>

329
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:44,689
Two for dinner.

330
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:46,046
Just the two of you?

331
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:52,581
<i>All by ourselves</i>

332
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:56,399
<i>Don't want to be</i>

333
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:00,700
<i>All by ourselves</i>

334
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:03,563
<i>Anymore</i>

335
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,924
<i>All by ourselves...</i>

336
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:10,462
Why don't we call that

337
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:13,209
weird couple down the hall
from you? You know, with the ferrets?

338
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,604
Maybe they want to come over
and play taboo.

339
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:17,132
After midnight? No way.

340
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:19,580
We can't Tabooty-call them,
it's pathetic.

341
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,357
Are you wearing sweat pants?

342
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:28,708
Maybe. But they're Armani.

343
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:32,946
Okay, guys, I've got
some bad news for you.

344
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:35,056
So I'm just going
to come out and say it.

345
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,481
You're a couple.

346
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:40,333
And no matter how hard you try to
fight it, couples need other couples.

347
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,571
That's why you miss
Marshall and Lily.

348
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,696
And can't you just admit that?

349
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,945
- That was amazing, Lily!
- I know!

350
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:55,198
When I got that left-hand-yellow,
I was like, "What?!"

351
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,937
- You guys are the best.
- Right back at you!

352
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,876
For charades.

353
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,590
How do we know you two
won't hurt us again?

354
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:55,342
You don't.

355
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,460
You know what? We have two...

356
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:01,506
very nice people
up in that apartment

357
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,892
who are perfect for us.

358
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:05,935
Then what are you doing,

359
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,521
standing out in the rain with us?

360
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:10,536
Damn it.

361
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:14,088
Why is there something
so attractive about a bad boy...

362
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,153
and girl?

363
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,663
I think we can change them.

364
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,609
Come here, you two.

365
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,374
We'll never sleep
on the gouda again.

366
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:33,734
<i>All by ourselves...</i>

367
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:38,378
I got a little poem for you.
You want to hear it?

368
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:41,054
- Not really.
- "It was the night before this one,

369
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,383
I had hours to kill.

370
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,078
<i>I sat in the tavern,
grading parchments with quill."</i>

371
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,311
With quill?

372
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:50,480
Barney. It's a poem.

373
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:54,526
<i>"A busty, young lassie
flashed me a grin.</i>

374
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:58,490
<i>Her garb said "classy",
but her eyes whispered "sin".</i>

375
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:01,616
<i>She said, "You're a teacher?"</i>

376
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,243
<i>I said, "Yes, indeed".</i>

377
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,119
<i>"I must have you", she moaned.
"I'm turned on by tweed".</i>

378
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:11,877
<i>With haste we did scamper
to my chamber anon.</i>

379
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,828
<i>We fell to the couch,
and, bro, it was on.</i>

380
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:20,287
<i>I unlaced her bodice.
Our passions grew deeper.</i>

381
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:22,463
<i>And thus ends the tale</i>

382
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,692
<i>of the Sexless Innkeeper."</i>

383
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,862
No way.

384
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,562
You made that up.

385
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:34,441
Are you coming back to bed,
professor?

386
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:40,898
God, I love being single.

387
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,159
You ready for brunch
with Lily and Marshall?

388
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:47,946
What have I done?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
