1
00:00:00,437 --> 00:00:04,141
<i>It was the Fall of 2009 and I was a professor now.</i>

2
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,296
<i>So I decided to change my look
a little bit.</i>

3
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:08,398
<i>And people were noticing.</i>

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,650
Ah, tweed.

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:12,202
Textile of the eunuch.

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,520
You know, I've always

7
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:15,955
Wondered why those tweed jackets
have elbow patches.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,907
Because the people
who wear them are
constantly going,

9
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:20,908
"Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?"

10
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:22,979
You are wrong. Get laid?

11
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,931
The ladies dig
the professor look.

12
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:26,499
You know, there is
something to that.

13
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,618
I remember thinking my tenth grade
math teacher

14
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:30,787
Was very sexy.

15
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:32,822
I wonder if Harold's
still in jail.

16
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,541
What?

17
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:37,210
Tax evasion.

18
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:38,628
(quietly):
Among other things.

19
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:41,330
So guys, Marshall

20
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,266
And I wanted to invite
you to our place

21
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,034
For a little couples' night.

22
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:47,353
Uh, sure. Why not?

23
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:50,023
<i>For years, Marshall and Lily
had been the only</i>

24
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,559
<i>Married couple in a group full
of single people.</i>

25
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:53,726
<i>It got lonely.</i>

26
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:54,978
<i>(doorbell rings)
so they were always</i>

27
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,396
<i>Searching
for another couple</i>

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,513
<i>To double-date.</i>

29
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,065
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

30
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:01,351
Welcome.
Gouda?

31
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:03,520
<i>They sucked at it.</i>

32
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:05,321
(laughing):
This is great. 

33
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:07,440
We're having fun.
You're having fun, right?

34
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:10,009
So, should we
just go ahead

35
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:12,078
And lock the four of
us in for new year's?

36
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:14,597
Um, it's April.

37
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,866
Right. Sorry.

38
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,084
We're getting
ahead of ourselves.

39
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:19,419
Let's talk Thanksgiving.

40
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:22,589
Our parents really
want to meet you!

41
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:29,446
Well, we should
probably be going.

42
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,980
Wait. But, wait,
if you leave now,

43
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:32,682
Colonel mustard
just gets away with it.

44
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,884
It's getting pretty late.
We're going to go.

45
00:01:34,935 --> 00:01:36,219
There's still pie.

46
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,608
Tonight was fantastic.
We should do it again.

47
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:44,844
I'm sorry, Marshall,
but Falguni and I

48
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:46,613
Are just not that into you.

49
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:49,048
And you.

50
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,701
<i>But just when Lily and Marshall
were about to give up,</i>

51
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,120
<i>Two of their best friends
in the world got together.</i>

52
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:56,289
<i>And hope returned
to their hearts.</i>

53
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,907
Wohoo!

54
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,926
<i>So when Lily said...</i>

55
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,462
Marshall and I wanted
to invite you to our place

56
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,230
For a little couples' night.

57
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,616
Um, sure, why not?

58
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:08,518
<i>.Barney and Robin had no idea</i>

59
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,986
<i>What they were
about to walk into.</i>

60
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:11,387
Okay. Game time.

61
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:13,223
Let's review
the flow of the room.

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,642
Barney and Robin
enter here.

63
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:17,227
Stop here for margaritas.

64
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:18,862
That's a great
conversation starter.

65
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,897
We can tell them about
our trip to Cabo.

66
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,899
Great, 'cause I got that story
about Sammy Hagar

67
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,901
Anthe Belgian waffle locked
and loaded.

68
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:27,720
Then we'll move on
to the hot apps station.

69
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:29,706
And, depending on how
things are going,

70
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,258
Some lively pre-dinner charades.

71
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:36,329
Right, but, uh,
we'll play that one by...

72
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:37,680
Sounds like?

73
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,799
Okay, you can be
Robin's partner.

74
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:41,217
(doorbell rings)

75
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:44,470
Oh... Baby, we can do this.

76
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:49,142
Welcome.
Gouda?

77
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:52,762
<i>Meanwhile,
my half-baked theory</i>

78
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:54,147
<i>That ladies dig
the professor look</i>

79
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,782
<i>Was actually
proving to be true</i>

80
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,433
So is it hard
to grade papers?

81
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,068
No, you've just got
to make it fun.

82
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:01,988
For example, uh, every time
I spot a grammatical error,

83
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,439
I do a shot.

84
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,991
I'm trashed right now,
and I blame

85
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:07,026
Our public school system.

86
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:10,163
<i>Sometimes things just seem
to magically fall into place.</i>

87
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,782
So, you said
you live right upstairs...

88
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,867
<i>Whether it's
in the dating world...</i>

89
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:16,536
Take care. Bye.
(laughs)
bye!

90
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,005
<i>...Or the double-dating world.</i>

91
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:20,290
Nailed it!

92
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:21,658
Best night ever!

93
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:25,661
Worst night ever.

94
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:26,930
(imitates gunshot)

96
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,354
Hey, how was the big couples'
night with Marshall and Lily?

97
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,507
Brutal.
Really? How?

98
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,558
It was like we were on a date

99
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,861
With a sad, chubby girl 
our mom made us call.

100
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:53,529
And they were so nervous,

101
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,748
That they weren't even making sense
half of the time.

102
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,116
Hey.
Come on in.

103
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,584
Would you
like a margarita?

104
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,237
In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!
Come on in.

105
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,809
And they kept shoving platters
of food in our faces.

106
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:08,410
Let me guess:
Did Marshall get, like,

107
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:10,096
Super intense about the cheese?

108
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:11,681
(gasps):
Yeah, how'd you know?

109
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,099
Poor Marshall.

110
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:15,184
Lily's this gourmet cook,
and all she lets Marshall

111
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:18,070
Is pick out one sad block of cheese.

112
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:20,039
That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.

113
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:22,391
You guys are going to want
to get in on this gouda.

114
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:24,827
That's seared scallops
with a mango chutney.

115
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:26,662
Seriously, don't sleep
on the gouda.

116
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,797
And that's

117
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:29,982
Lobster ravioli
in a black truffle oil.

118
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,285
Ooh...
Tick-tock goes the gouda clock.

119
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:36,289
Um, we-we-we didn't realize
there was gonna be dinner.

120
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:38,674
We sucked down a couple
tacos outside the subway.

121
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:41,377
P.S., not
sitting great.

122
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,665
And if anything didn't go
according to plan,

123
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:47,099
They would freak out.

124
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,685
What do you mean,
the egg timer is broken?

125
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,587
What are we going to use
for charades, sweetie?

126
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:52,922
I'm working on it, darling.

127
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,390
Okay? Just stall them.

128
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,176
Now, Robin...

129
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:58,477
You work in television.

130
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:01,180
We're experiencing some
technical difficulties.

131
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,265
(laughs):
You get that?

132
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,150
We're still laughing.

133
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:07,370
Right? Laugh, Marshall.

134
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,138
(laughs)

135
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:11,173
(Lily and Marshall
continue laughing)

136
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,109
Come on, they just
got excited.

137
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,294
They've been looking for couple
best friends forever.

138
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:17,313
<i>Plus, I'm sure
they weren't that bad.</i>

139
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:19,448
Show him.

140
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:21,617
This is a web site

141
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:24,270
Marshall already made
about last night.

142
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:28,341
It's called
itwasthebestnightever.com.

143
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,160
(acoustic guitar strums)

144
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:34,430
Marshall:
* it was the best night ever *

145
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:38,634
* laughter raining down
like April showers *

146
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,972
* oh, we talked for hours... *

147
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,160
* best night ever *
oh, that's not good.

148
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:51,030
* then we played charades *

149
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:54,533
* Lily made some creme brulee,
lay-lay-lay-lay *

150
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:57,903
* and now that
we're best couple friends *

151
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:00,456
* there's only one thing *

152
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:04,877
* left to say... *

153
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,213
* are you free? Are you free?
Are you free? *

154
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,333
* are you free?
Are you free next Saturday? *

155
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:12,535
That's the 17th.
* are you free? *

156
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:14,070
Friday or Sunday
would also work.

157
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,822
Or basically any other day.

158
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,875
Needless to say, we've both changed
our e-mail addresses.

159
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,377
I don't understand.

160
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,212
If last night went so horribly,

161
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,531
Why do Lily and Marshall
think it was such a hit?

162
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,500
I mean, we knew we were gonna have
fun tonight,

163
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,602
But we had no idea how much.

164
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,786
Oh.
Yeah, tough luck,

165
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:32,438
Every Saturday
night I've ever had,

166
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,757
'cause this one just
blew you out of the water.

167
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,959
Let's do it again, soon.
Yeah, we'll call you.

168
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:38,227
They're your friends!

169
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:40,680
Why would you just blatantly lie
to them like that?

170
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,282
Well, that's what you say
at the end of a crappy date.

171
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,534
Hey, Ted.
Great time last night.

172
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,070
Well, let's do it again, soon.
I'll...uh, call you.

173
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,824
(door closes)
Right?

174
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:53,643
Who was that?

175
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,860
Oh, I don't want to brag,

176
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:57,029
But it seems chicks
are really digging

177
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,297
The whole professor thing.

178
00:06:58,365 --> 00:06:59,382
Last night,

179
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,800
She picked me up at the bar.

180
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,469
And then...
Well, she actually

181
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,104
Wound up falling asleep
on the couch.

182
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:08,424
But, hey, that happens.

183
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,959
Uh, no, it doesn't.

184
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:11,243
Sure, it does.

185
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:12,545
You know, she was,

186
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:14,864
She was just exhausted
from being turned on.

187
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,065
But you heard her.

188
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,984
She wants to do it again, soon.

189
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,454
Ted, let me ask you a question.

190
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:23,889
Where does this girl
live, exactly?

191
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,057
Westchester. Why?

192
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,442
(laughs)

193
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:29,912
You're the sexless innkeeper.

194
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,747
Oh, my god!
You're right!

195
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:33,282
He's totally
the sexless innkeeper!

196
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:36,135
What the hell is
"the sexless innkeeper"?

197
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,472
Ted, many a man--
nay, many a soul--

198
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:41,924
Has their own tale of
the sexless innkeeper.

199
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,593
Why, I had run-in
with one just last year.

200
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:46,645
I even composed
a poem about it.

201
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,481
Would you care to hear it?
Not really.

202
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,316
T'was the night
before new year's,

203
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,601
And the weather grew mean.

204
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,370
It was 3:00 in the morning,

205
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,989
And I was stranded in queens.

206
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:59,658
<i>The tavern grew empty,</i>

207
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,111
<i>The gas lights grew dim.</i>

208
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:05,865
<i>The horse-drawn carriages
were all but snowed in...</i>

209
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,166
Wait. If this was last year,

210
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,034
<i>Why are you acting like it
was Oliver Twist?</i>

211
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,487
Ted, it's a poem.

212
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,423
<i>Last call was approaching,</i>

213
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,492
<i>And my fortunes looked bleak.</i>

214
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,827
<i>Then I turned to my left</i>

215
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,180
<i>And stifled a shriek.</i>

216
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:23,599
<i>She had a peach fuzz beard</i>

217
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,385
<i>And weighed 16 stone.</i>

218
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,437
<i>She gobbled up hot wings</i>

219
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:30,990
<i>And swallowed the bones.</i>

220
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:32,641
<i>I muffled a scream</i>

221
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,843
<i>And threw up in my mouth.</i>

222
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:37,446
<i>I asked, "where do you live?"</i>

223
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:40,682
<i>And she said,
"one block south."</i>

224
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,536
<i>I swallowed my pride</i>

225
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,455
<i>And six shots of whiskey.</i>

226
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:50,176
<i>And prayed to the gods</i>

227
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:53,078
<i>That she wasn't too frisky.</i>

228
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:57,416
<i>Back in her cave,
she prepared us a snack.</i>

229
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:02,254
<i>'neath her mighty hooves,
the floorboards did crack.</i>

230
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,473
<i>But when she returned,</i>

231
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,859
<i>She found a sound sleeper.</i>

232
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:09,678
<i>And thus she became</i>

233
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,898
<i>The sexless innkeeper.</i>

234
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:14,266
And so are you

235
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,835
Wait, you're saying that girl

236
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,753
Just used me
for a place to crash?

237
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,322
Ted, you mentioned that
you live right upstairs.

238
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,192
She saw the tweed jacket
which basically says

239
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:27,112
You're not interested in, nor probably even
capable of, having sex.

240
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:29,882
And she thought,
"hey, free lodging."

241
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,450
No way.

242
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,385
I'm not the sexless innkeeper.

243
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,454
Ted, that girl
had no intention

244
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,089
Of ever hooking
up with you.

245
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:39,074
Which is funny,
because usually

246
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:42,261
It's the innkeeper who offers
turndown service. Oh!

247
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:43,579
(laughing)

248
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,632
Hey, guys. Good news.

249
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,551
First of all, you can ignore
all the e-mails

250
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,802
And texts we've sent you.

251
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,787
We have. Go on.

252
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:53,222
Because we went
ahead and booked

253
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:55,741
That couples' weekend
for all of us in Vermont!

254
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,593
Wait, you guys were
serious about that?

255
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,261
Oh, we never
joke about b&b's,

256
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:00,946
Especially at the height
of syrup season.

257
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,064
Check it out.

258
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,033
Saturday we've got
apple-picking,

259
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,586
Antiquing, then
a hated hay ride.

260
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:10,906
And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m.
for the fall foliage hike.

261
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:13,742
Now, you better pack
your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.

262
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,464
Look! I'm sorry that we have been
dodging your calls,

263
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,049
But we respect
you guys too much

264
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:21,950
As friends to give
you some song and dance.

265
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:23,152
You deserve the truth.

266
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:27,590
(sighs)

267
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:31,627
The US Navy has found
intelligent alien life

268
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,195
At the bottom of the ocean.

269
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:36,315
For reasons I can't
explain, Robin and I

270
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,767
Have been tapped
to lead the expedition.

271
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,119
Wow, Barney.

272
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,738
That kind of sounds like
the stuff you say to girls

273
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:45,274
When you're too much of a coward to dump them.
Yeah.

274
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,526
You know, that's exactly
what it sounds like.

275
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,962
But if that's true,
that's awesome.

276
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,281
What's going on?

277
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:55,834
Look, all the couple-y stuff,
it's just not us.

278
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,320
Barney and I are barely equipped
to date each other,

279
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,538
Let alone you guys.

280
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:03,142
Plus, the alien thing.

281
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:04,993
Come on, Marshall.
Let's go.

282
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,962
No...Lily...
You know what?

283
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:11,600
I hope those underwater aliens
are cold-blooded.

284
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:14,770
'cause then you guys will
get along just fine.

285
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:22,061
I think they bought it.

286
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:25,981
I can't believe they
broke up with us.

287
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,784
We're so lovable.

288
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:31,287
No, we're not.
We're ugly and gross.

289
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,739
I thought we did
everything right.

290
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,040
I know!

291
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,742
I know. We had the gouda.

292
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,077
We had my waffle story.

293
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,379
I even sent them a
awesome photo montage.

294
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,749
Nothing.

295
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,001
Oh, dear god.

296
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,721
Marshall, we've been 
over and over this.

297
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:51,373
You have to stop
sending those to people.

298
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,858
<i>It was true.</i>

299
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,227
<i>Marshall had become addicted
to creating songs</i>

300
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:58,664
<i>And photo montages documenting
various mundane events.</i>

301
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,316
<i>So for months,
all of Marshall's</i>

302
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,767
<i>friends and professional
colleagues</i>

303
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:03,335
<i>Were getting e-mails
like this...</i>

304
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:06,722
Marshall:
* ordered Chinese food today *

305
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:10,676
* some moo shu pork sauce
got away *

306
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,277
* flipped the cushion *

307
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:16,081
* now everything's okay. *

308
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,920
* cat-sitting for Lily's mom *

309
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:25,407
* cat-sitting
for Lily's mom *

310
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,908
* it's gonna be fun *

311
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,080
* it's gonna bring us all
closer together. *

312
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:36,435
* cat funeral *

313
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:39,605
* cat funeral *

314
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:43,075
* it was an accident *

315
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:46,895
* and not entirely my fault *

316
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:50,366
<i>* cat funeral *
* meow, meow, meow, meow *</i>

317
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:54,620
<i>* meow, meow, meow, meow *
* cat funeral *</i>

318
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,722
Marshall:
We'll miss you, whiskers.

319
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,426
<i>* meow, meow, meow, meow,
meow... *</i>

320
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,997
I can't believe you sent them one of those.

321
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,082
They think we're insane now.

322
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,001
If I recall, they didn't dump us

323
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:10,836
Until you brought up
that Vermont trip.

324
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,237
It was way too early.

325
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:13,722
First, a boat ride
around the city,

326
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,190
Then a trip to Vermont.

327
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,493
It's a rookie mistake,
and you're better than that.

328
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,861
Oh, what about you forgetting

329
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,230
To check the egg timer
for charades?

330
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:24,600
I gave you one thing
to do, Marshall. One thing.

331
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:25,851
One thing?

332
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:27,519
One thing?

333
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:30,806
Wow. Really?

334
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:34,142
So, I guess that gouda

335
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,695
Just walked itself
right through the door...

336
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:39,615
...Sliced itself up,

337
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,368
And arranged itself
in a perfect semi-circle

338
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:48,290
Around not three, not four...

339
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:50,325
But five different kinds

340
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:53,429
Of sturdy,
cheese-bearing crackers?

341
00:13:54,848 --> 00:13:57,316
You're a sturdy,
cheese-bearing cracker!

342
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:01,937
Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't
been to the bar all week.

343
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:03,172
They're taking
this really hard.

344
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,307
Ted, I could listen to
this guilt trip all day,

345
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,726
But don't you have to
get back up to the inn?

346
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,678
I mean, who's working
the front desk?

347
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:12,030
Seriously, they're
your friends.

348
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:13,315
You got to go apologize.

349
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:16,735
To your point, Ted,
as an innkeeper,

350
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,403
Do you do that cheapy thing

351
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:20,873
Where you only change
the linens upon request?

352
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:24,993
I mean, I mean, I mean, how much
water is that actually saving?

353
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:26,361
Robin, you know I'm right.

354
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:27,996
Ignoring a problem
doesn't make it go away.

355
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:29,264
Usually,
it just makes it bigger.

356
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:30,699
You're right.

357
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:31,917
Thank you.

358
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:34,002
All that sexlessness
has made you wise.

359
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,754
For god's sake!

360
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,172
Mint on the pillow, Ted!

361
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,391
And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy!
It does.

362
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:42,161
(laughing)

363
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,479
<i>Narrator:
But eventually,</i>

364
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,514
<i>Even Barney and Robin
had to admit</i>

365
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,766
<i>They owed Lily and Marshall
an apology.</i>

366
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,351
Hey.

367
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:51,170
We wanted to say we're sorry.

368
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,505
Oh. I wish you had called.

369
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,524
Marshall:
I swear, he was right there

370
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,359
Just eating a Belgian waffle!

371
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:58,894
(laughter)

372
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:00,112
Well, he can't
have enjoyed it

373
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:01,580
As much as I'm enjoying
this gouda!

374
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:02,714
Oh!

375
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,616
Um, listen,

376
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,752
Now's not a good time.

377
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,253
We'll call you.

378
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:10,071
Wai.t We just want...

379
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:19,551
Hey! Hey, guys.
Hey. Long time no see.

380
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,569
Have a seat.
Sit.

381
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:23,521
Oh, we can't. 
We're here with Py and Shea.

382
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:24,873
Yeah, sorry.

383
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,725
Oh, it's just... We haven't
seen you guys all week.

384
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:29,350
Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.
Yeah.

385
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:32,898
Oh, it might be weird. 
We're kind of on a double date. 

386
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:35,968
Wouldn't want you to feel
like a fifth and sixth wheel.

387
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,204
Who the hell are these people?

388
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,422
They just moved
here from Hawaii.

389
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,908
Py is a total foodie and Shea, well...
Mmm!

390
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,477
She's...

391
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,596
Shea...Shea is just...

392
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,348
(both laughing)

393
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,966
(sighing contentedly)

394
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,751
Anyhoo, we can't stay long.

395
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,188
We're just gonna grab a quick
beer and then take these kooks

396
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,806
For a boat ride
around the city.

397
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,726
Wow, it sounds like this is
getting pretty serious.

398
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,695
Well, we don't want
to jinx it, but, uh...

399
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,281
We kind of think
they might be the two.

400
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,651
Ooh.

401
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,404
Pfft, who needs 'em?

402
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:15,241
Pfft. Not us.

403
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,209
(laughing)

404
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,918
* livin' alone *

405
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:30,122
* we think of all the friends
we've known *

406
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:37,680
* but when
we dial the telephone *

407
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,765
* nobody's home *

408
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,019
Hi. Two for dinner.

409
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,121
Just the two of you?

410
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:53,412
* all by ourselves *

411
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,498
* don't want to be *

412
00:16:56,583 --> 00:17:03,372
* all by ourselves anymore *

413
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,492
* all by ourselves... *

414
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,812
Hey, why don't we call

415
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:11,680
That weird couple
down the hall from you?

416
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,182
You know, with the ferrets?

417
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,467
Maybe they want to come over
and play taboo.

418
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:17,019
After midnight?
No way.

419
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,638
We can't tabooty-call
them, it's pathetic.

420
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,740
Hey, guys.

421
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,392
(groaning)

422
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,744
Barney,
are you wearing sweat pants?

423
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:29,999
Maybe. But they're Armani.

424
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,401
Okay, guys, I've got
some bad news for you.

425
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,486
So I'm just going
to come out and say it.

426
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,238
You're a couple.

427
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,890
And no matter how hard
you try to fight it,

428
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,025
Couples need other couples.

429
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,294
That's why you miss
Marshall and Lily.

430
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,879
And can't you just admit that?

431
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,051
(laughing)
Oh, yeah!

432
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,619
That was amazing, Lily!

433
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,004
I know!

434
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,240
When I got that left-hand-
yellow, I was like, "what?!"

435
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,026
You guys are the best.

436
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:57,993
Oh, right back at you!

437
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,062
(knocking at door)

438
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,150
(ticking)

439
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,572
(bell dings)

440
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,046
(ticking continues)

441
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,387
(bell dings)

442
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,441
(ticking continues)

443
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,080
Ding.

444
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,960
For charades.

445
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,615
How do we know you two
won't hurt us again?

446
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,401
You don't.

447
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,069
You know what?

448
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,323
We have two very nice people
up in that apartment

449
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,942
Who are perfect for us.

450
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:05,327
Then what are you doing,

451
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,564
Standing out in
the rain with us?

452
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:09,998
Damn it.

453
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,836
Why is there something so
attractive about a bad boy...

454
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,220
And girl?

455
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,507
I think we can change them.

456
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:21,293
Come here, you two.

457
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,581
(sobbing)

458
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:28,484
We'll never sleep
on the gouda again.

459
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:34,239
* all by ourselves... *

460
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,857
Hey, Barney. I got
a little poem for you.

461
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:39,525
You want to hear it?
No, not really.

462
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:43,613
'twas the night
before, I had hours to kill.

463
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:47,617
<i>I sat in the tavern,
grading parchments with quill.</i>

464
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,634
With quill?

465
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:50,820
Barney. It's a poem.

466
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:54,824
<i>A busty, young lassie
flashed me a grin.</i>

467
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:58,945
<i>Her garb said "classy,"
but her eyes whispered "sin."</i>

468
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:01,914
<i>She said, "you're a teacher?"</i>

469
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,599
<i>I said, "yes, indeed."</i>

470
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:05,251
<i>"I must have you," she moaned.</i>

471
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,670
<i>"I'm turned on by tweed."</i>

472
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:10,423
<i>With haste we did scamper</i>

473
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:12,058
<i>To my chamber anon.</i>

474
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:17,230
<i>We fell to the couch,
and, bro, it was on.</i>

475
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,815
<i>I unlaced her bodice.</i>

476
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,650
<i>Our passions grew deeper.</i>

477
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:25,988
<i>And thus ends the tale
of the sexless innkeeper.</i>

478
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:29,108
No way.

479
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:30,910
You made that up.

480
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,797
Are you coming back
bed, professor?

481
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:39,118
Whew!

482
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,653
God, I love being single.

483
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,709
Barney, you ready for brunch
with Lily and Marshall?

484
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:48,044
What have I done?
