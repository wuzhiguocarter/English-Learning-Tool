<i>NARRATOR: Kids, up to
this point in the story,</i>

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,949
<i>we had found doppelgangers.</i>

3
00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:06,562
Eerie but awesome look-alikes

4
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:08,555
<i>for four of the five members
of our little group.</i>

5
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,464
<i>There was Lesbian Robin...</i>

6
00:00:10,584 --> 00:00:11,458
(spits)

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,581
<i>Mustache Marshall...</i>

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,478
<i>Stripper Lily...</i>

9
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:20,253
<i>and Mexican Wrestler Me.</i>

10
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:21,969
<i>Yes, mine was the coolest.</i>

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,103
(cheering)

12
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:24,405
<i>And so we were all eager</i>

13
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:26,507
<i>to find The Fifth Doppelganger:
Barney's.</i>

14
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:28,042
<i>Turned out,
it was more important</i>

15
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:29,476
<i>to some of us than others.</i>

16
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,578
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby

17
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,914
until we've seen
all five doppelgangers, right?

18
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:35,883
Yeah, of course.
Stands to reason.

19
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:38,519
Okay, so, when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,321
that's the universe
telling us it's go time.

21
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:42,623
And that's when
we'll start trying.

22
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:43,624
Deal?

23
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,259
Deal.

24
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,728
<i>And then one day,
a few weeks later...</i>

25
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:48,829
Baby, were we serious about

26
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,130
the whole Fifth
Doppelganger thing?

27
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,066
I mean, having a baby
is a pretty big thing

28
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:53,133
to leave up to the universe.

29
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:54,702
Yeah, I know it's crazy.

30
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:57,671
It's just so much easier
to let the universe decide.

31
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:00,207
Why do you ask?

32
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,341
Boom!

33
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:02,843
Universed!

34
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:03,811
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,079
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

36
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,047
That could easily be Barney

37
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:08,415
pulling some scam
to meet chicks.

38
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,217
I'm one step ahead of you.

39
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:11,452
Go for Barney.

40
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:12,753
Barney, hey.
It's Marshall.

41
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:14,254
So you are at work?

42
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:15,556
You're not--
I don't know--

43
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:17,458
driving a cab, wearing a wig.

44
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,693
Yes, I'm at work.

45
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:21,695
That's the sound of my stapler.

46
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,130
That's the sound
of my three-hole punch.

47
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:24,865
And this is the sound
of me filing

48
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:27,167
my corporate guidelines
on sexual harassment.

49
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:28,168
(shredder buzzes)

50
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:29,703
What is up?!

51
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:31,538
Got to go, Big Chief.

52
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,678
Barney's at work.

53
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:40,714
That-that was The
Fifth Doppelganger.

54
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,752
Marshall Eriksen...

55
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:46,720
put a baby in my belly.

57
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,337
I can't wait to tell the gang.

58
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:05,973
This is one of those moments
you dream about.

59
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:07,908
"Guys...

60
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,676
"Lily and I...

61
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:11,211
are having unprotected sex."

62
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:12,846
Ooh, I just got the chills.

63
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:14,381
We're not gonna say anything.

64
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:15,382
What? Why?

65
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:16,817
Marshall, if we tell them,

66
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,685
we're basically
inviting them into

67
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:21,722
the most private,
intimate moment of our lives.

68
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:27,728
You guys banging?
(Marshall and Lily scream)

69
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,330
Keep going; I'm
not even here.

70
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,698
But just for the record,

71
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,567
having a baby: huge mistake.

72
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,035
Now, show me what you got.

73
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:37,004
Uncle Teddy's here!
(Marshall and Lily scream)

74
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,639
Quick question:
How you guys gonna handle

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,673
the whole Santa thing?

76
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,175
I'm thinking, just be honest.

77
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,510
(chuckles):
Ah, hell. I'll dress up.

78
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,679
This just in...
(Marshall and Lily scream)

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,115
is what Marshall Eriksen
is about to say to his wife

80
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,184
as he attempts
to impregnate her.

81
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,621
Chopper 12 is live on the scene
with "Baby Watch: 2010."

82
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:57,324
(helicopter hovering)

83
00:02:57,325 --> 00:03:00,060
(wind blustering)

84
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,964
Okay, fine. I won't tell anybody
about the baby thing.

85
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:05,465
Hey, guys.

86
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,767
Hey.
Guys...

87
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,702
We saw The Fifth Doppelganger!

88
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:09,703
(gasps) Whoa!

89
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:11,104
Amazing!
That is awesome!

90
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:12,639
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, freaky.

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
A brunette Barney.

92
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,641
I know.

93
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,076
Say what you will
about the guy,

94
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,444
but Barney seems right
as a blonde.

95
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:18,645
Well, that's true.
Not every dude

96
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,113
can pull that off
the blonde look.

97
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:22,316
I don't know about that.

98
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:23,350
What?

99
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,519
Oh, that summer
I was lifeguarding

100
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,688
at the Chagrin Falls
Country Club,

101
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,257
I was lathering a little
lemon juice into the old mop,

102
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,159
playing with some
natural highlights.

103
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,760
Let's just say there were a few

104
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,531
senior citizens who pretended
to drown on my watch.

105
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:39,533
And sadly, one who did.

106
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:40,734
Anyway,

107
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,603
I'd look good blonde.

108

<i>MARSHALL: Okay, people,

some nachos.

127
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:19,740
I love you, buddy, but
there's absolutely no way

128
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,508
that you could pull off blonde.

129
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,210
It-it just wouldn't
look right.

130
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:26,313
Yeah, seriously, Ted,
don't go blonde.

131
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:28,081

132
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,149
No!
No!

133
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,317
That is not the outcome

134
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:31,985
we were hoping for!

135
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,288
<i>NARRATOR: Now, kids, Robin and Don</i>

136
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:36,456
<i>were becoming
such a great team, both off</i>

137
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:39,192
<i>and on the air, that local

So, that's why Monty and I
vow never to do drugs.

140
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:55,242
Because drugs are bad.

141
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,144
Right, Monty?

I need to talk to you right now.

183
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,104
You know what, it can wait.

184
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,273
No, go ahead. I'm listening.

185
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:34,975
Okay, well,

186
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,943
the executive producer from WNKW

187
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,345
happened to see our
show the other morning

188
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,247
and loved me.

189
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:42,949
They offered me the lead
anchor job, starting next week.

190
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,018
Wow, that's great!

191
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,019
It is great.

192
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,287
But, um, here's the catch.

193
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,321
WNKW is in...

194
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:49,322
(dryer whirring)

195
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,625
H-helen, kill the dryer!

196
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,127
(dryer stops)

197
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:55,962
Is in Chicago.

198
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:01,215
But you were
The Fifth Doppelganger.

199
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:03,250
How-how can you be you?

200
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:05,486
I called you, Barney;
We had a whole conversation!

201
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,588
Ah, yes, I know what happened.

202
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,256
See, people at work have

203
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:12,993
this very strange expectation
that I, well, work.

204
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,161
(scoffs)

205
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:15,929
I know, I know.

206
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,465
<i>So to make my colleagues think
I'm busting my hump</i>

207
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:21,201
<i>when I'm really out humping
busty chicks,</i>

208
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:23,136
<i>I decided to record
a special message.</i>

209
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:25,038
What is up?!

210
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,773
Got to go, Big Chief.

211
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:28,475
How can it be a recording?

212
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:32,079
You called me Big Chief,
my special workplace nickname.

213
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,815
Oh, buddy.

214
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:36,750
(exhales forcefully)

215
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:38,452
Hey, hey.

216
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,387
Come on, Big Chief.

217
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:41,788
Don't.

218
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:44,691
Just don't.

219
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,460
Why does this have
to happen now?

220
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:49,396
I mean, just when things are
going so great with Don.

221
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:51,298
(sighs)
It's the never-ending battle

222
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,700
of my life:
Career versus romance.

223
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,603
(laughs):
"Never-ending battle"?

224
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,972
Career has been
trouncing romance for years.

225
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,040
It's like the Globetrotters

226
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,675
versus the Generals.

227
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:03,510
Career's sinking hook shots
from half court,

228
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,412
Romance is just
a bunch of slow white guys

229
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:07,247
who couldn't make it
in the Italian league.

230
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:08,248
(sighs)

231
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:10,684
Ted, I'm lost.

232
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:12,586
What should I do?

233
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:15,789
Okay, you seriously need
to talk to Don about this.

234
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,525
I'm just too confused
to put this on Don.

235
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:21,828
I need to leave him out of it
until I figure out what I want.

236
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:23,664
That makes sense.
Yeah.

237
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:25,899
And I'm sorry I can't give you
better advice on this.

238
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,135
The truth is,
it's impossible for me

239
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:30,470
to be objective
about you moving away.

240
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:35,576
Mm. Did you get a manicure?

241
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,177
No, I didn't get a...

242
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:38,412
He sure did.

243
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:40,480
Flo!

244
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,649
Why are you brunette
and driving a cab?

245
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,750
Oh, that.

246
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,686
You know how
it's my dream to have sex

247
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:48,088
with at least one woman from
every country on the planet?

248
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:49,289
Sure.

249
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,993
Wow.

250
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:54,061
You're doing surprisingly well

251
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:55,228
in the Baltics.
Mm-hmm.

252
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:56,363
So, I figure,

253
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:57,397
what's the quickest way

254
00:08:57,398 --> 00:08:59,499
to get around the world
in 180 lays?

255
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,868
Lease a cab and wait outside
the U.N. building

256
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:02,970
for hot foreign chicks.

257
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,771
<i>It was the perfect plan.</i>

258
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:08,575
<i>There was only one small detail
I didn't take into account.</i>

259
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:09,710
Chicks don't want
to bang cab drivers.

260
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:11,979
Chicks do not want
to bang cab drivers!

261
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,381
And I put a lot of
work into this one.

262
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,917
I can't believe this.

263
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:19,720
Now I got to tell Lily The Fifth
Doppelganger is a fake.

264
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,154
So? What does she care?

265
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:25,192
Lily decided that once
we spotted your doppelganger,

266
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:26,793
we'd start trying to have kids.

267
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,261
Kids?! No!

268
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,463
Uh-uh!

269
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:32,232
The rule is: no kids
until you're at least 45!

270
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,534
Do you ever read my blog?!

271
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:37,237
It's gotten a lot better.

272
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:39,940
I'm ready to be a dad, you know?

273
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:44,311
But Lily needs some sign
from the universe.

274
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,213
And now it could be years.

275
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,749
I'm sorry, buddy.

276
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,718
That'll be $37.50.

277
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:53,020
<i>NARRATOR: So that night,</i>

278
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:56,123
<i>Marshall went home
to break the bad news to Lily.</i>

279
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:58,125
The universe has spoken.

280
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,762
Marshall Eriksen,
let's make a baby.

281
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:04,297
I...

282
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,434
Okay.

283
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,969
(both moaning)

284
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,805
Hey.
Hey.

285
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:16,076
(laughing hysterically)

286
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:20,280
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

287
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,282
I heard you were doing this,
so I worked on some stuff.

288
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,251
Uh, hey, uh, I'm planning
a "White Wedding."

289
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:26,620
Tell me, Billy Idol,
is it a nice day for that?

290
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:27,621
(chuckles)

291
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:29,222
Some other Billy Idol ones.

292
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,457
Um, if anyone's looking for

293
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,459
the real Slim Shady,
he's right here.

294
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:34,428
That one's only okay.

295
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:36,530
Robin, why aren't you
getting in on this?

296
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:39,266
Okay, first of all,
I'm getting tons of compliments.

297
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,868
Second of all, tell him.

298
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,270
He's not getting
tons of compliments.

299
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,471
No, the other thing.

300
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,639
ROBIN: Oh.

301
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,142
I might move to
Chicago next week.

302
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:53,313
Mm, um, hey, baby.

303
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:54,214
Hmm?

304
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:56,550
Not for nothing or nothing,

305
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,685
but we'd still be doing this

306
00:10:58,686 --> 00:11:00,887
even if we hadn't seen
Doppelganger Barney, right?

307
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:02,456
Ooh, but we did see him,

308
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:05,225
which means the universe--
in all its infinite wisdom--

309
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:07,327
is telling you to stick me

310
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:09,096
and stick me real good.

311
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:13,366
I can't. I can't in good
conscience stick you.

312
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,970
(sighs)
I know what's bothering you.

313
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:18,004
Really?

314
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,073
The cabbie just didn't look

315
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:21,475
enough like Barney.

316
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:25,178
Well, that's just not true.

317
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,680
No! Time-out!

318
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:28,248
This is a group decision!

319
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,885
You can't just move to Chicago
unless we all say it's okay.

320
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,854
Barney, I think
this has to be Robin's...

321
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:35,455
Stay out of this,
Brigitte Nielsen

322
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:37,824
or Dolph Lundgren
from Rocky IV!

323
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,559
We need Marshall and Lily.

324
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,595
That cabbie was like
a foot shorter than Barney!

325
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,330
He was the exact same size!

326
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:45,665
And you know what?
I think he was Asian.

327
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,568
Yeah, that guy was like
a tiny, graying Asian man

328
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,637
W-with a soul patch
and a potbelly.

329
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:52,639
Have you completely forgotten
what Barney looks like?!

330
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,508
You guys banging?
(Marshall and Lily scream)

331
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,243
Why are you in our bedroom?

332
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:57,911
(both scream)

333
00:11:57,912 --> 00:11:59,279
Why are you
in our bedroom?

334
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,281
(both scream)
Why is Ellen DeGeneres

335
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:02,516
in our bedroom?

336
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:06,520
(both chuckling)
Hey, this is working!

337
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,356
Wait a minute.

338
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:10,757
Candles...

339
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:12,425
Flowers...

340
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:15,996
Oh, I guess Marshall
"forgot" to tell you.

341
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:17,964
The Fifth Doppelganger...

342
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:19,132
was me.

343
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:22,235
What? Wait, and you
knew about this?

344
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:23,403
You lied to me?

345
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:24,771
By omission,
and it's only because

346
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:26,406
this whole "leave it
to the universe" thing

347
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:27,741
of yours is insane, Lily.

348
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:30,210
Baby, you... Lily, we need to
be in control of our own...

349
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:33,180
Guys, guys! We're forgetting
what's really important here.

350
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:36,316
Ted's blonde.
(all chuckling)

351
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:39,252
Guys, I am pulling this off.

352
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,288
Now, Robin has something

353
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:42,322
important to tell you.

354
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,456
He's not pulling it off.

355
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:44,858
No, the other thing.

356
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:45,926
He got a manicure.

357
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,460
The other thing.

358
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,964
I got a job offer in Chicago.

359
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,766
Whoa.

360
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,668
That's why we all
came down here--

361
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:56,870
to try and talk Robin
out of making a huge...

362
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:59,573
Actually, I-i've, I've
already made a decision.

363
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,276
(sighs) Guys, I gotta take it.

364
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,042
I can't believe
we're losing Robin.

365
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:16,579
<i>Guys, this might be
the depression talking,</i>

366
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,149
<i>but is Ted's hair starting
to look kind of good?</i>

367
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,684
<i>Thank God, I thought
I was the only one!</i>

368
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:24,954
<i>He looks like
a freakin' movie star!</i>

369
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:27,290
Oh, and by the way,
this was a huge mistake.

370
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,992
I'm changing my hair back.

371
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,094
Smart.
Told ya.

372
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,729
Not at all awesome.

373
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,164
Hey.

374
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:35,331
Hey.
Hey.

375
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,935
So, I just got off the phone
with Chicago.

376
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,937
Yes, I have made a decision.

377
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:43,139
Um...

378
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:51,214
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't take the job.

379
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:53,149
Thanks.

380
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,384
I'm staying.

381
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:55,618
Damn straight!
Yay!

382
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:57,921
(all exclaiming)

383
00:13:57,922 --> 00:13:59,289
Robin!

384
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,459
Hey, Lily,

385
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,893
tell me something.

386
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:06,729
When you saw actual Barney
driving that cab,

387
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,033
and you thought he was a petite,
potbellied Asian man?

388
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:11,668
I know. Weird, right?

389
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:12,702
It's not weird.

390
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:15,104
It means you're not ready.

391
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,774
And I'm... I'm sorry
that I tried to rush things.

392
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:19,843
Our baby can wait

393
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:21,144
for the real Doppelganger
Barney.

394
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:22,345
Oh...

395
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,449
Mm.

396
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,451
Mm.

397
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:35,859
(mimics Monty):
Hey, Moo-moo.

398
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,694
Monty made you
thin-crust pizza

399
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:38,995
just the way you like it!

400
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:41,731
Hi.
Mmm...

401
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,166
You okay?

402
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,102
Robin, you're not gonna
believe this.

403
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:50,240
I got offered the lead anchor
job at WNKW in Chicago.

404
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:53,977
Oh.

405
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:57,313
Um, what'd you say?

406
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:00,650
I said yes.

407
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:05,388
I've been waiting years
for a shot like this.

408
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:12,595
Barney?

409
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:14,931
(Estonian accent):
I am simple street performer

410
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,533
from Estonia.

411
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:18,401
Who is this Barney?

412
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:20,136
Oh, he's just this guy we know

413
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,838
who has, like,
a really lame blog.

414
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,107
I hear it's getting better.

415
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:26,476
I mean, wha-what is "blog"?

416
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,978
It's just something that was
cool, like, eight years ago.

417
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:31,614
Still cool.
Still sounds pretty cool, man.

418
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:32,582
What's your name?

419
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,517
Kristof.
Kristof what?

420
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,820
Kristof...

421
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,656
Doppelganger.

422
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:40,957
Really?
Yep.

423
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,225
You're gonna go with

424
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,760
the last name (mimics
accent): "Doppelganger"?

425
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,761
That's my name, man.

426
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:47,330
Bro...

427
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:49,299
Robin, wait. Please
try to understand.

428
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,767
I gotta get out of here.

429
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:52,168
Wait. Put yourself
in my shoes.

430
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,170
Can you imagine what it's like
to have the phone ring,

431
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,039
and it's your dream job
on the other end?

432
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,310
Yes... I can.

433
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:04,147
(voice breaking):
Good luck in Chicago, Don.

434
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,820
Barney, why are you doing this?

435
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:11,821
(grunts)

436
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,089
Wait a minute.

437
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,924
Could it, could it be

438
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:17,460
that Barney Stinson actually
wants us to have kids?

439
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:18,962
Who is this Barney?!

440
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:21,631
Take American chill pill!

441
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:24,400
Well, let me tell you
about him.

442
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,770
He talks a big game
about how no one should

443
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:30,940
ever have kids before
they're at least 45.

444
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,742
I would be interested in reading

445
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,545
some of these opinions
in blog form.

446
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,814
But I think I know
what happened.

447
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:40,383
Yesterday, Barney thought
he had to say good-bye

448
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,018
to someone he truly loves.

449
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,786
And it got him thinking...

450
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:46,289
Maybe it wouldn't
be the worst thing

451
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,224
if a baby joined
our little group.

452
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:51,361
Babies...

453
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:53,262
can be cute.

454
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,966
Mm. And someday,
he's gonna make

455
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,002
the best uncle in the world.

456
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:00,970
Because this Barney...

457
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:03,206
He's family to us.

458
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,618
(Eastern-european accent):
Excuse me.

459
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,487
I heard you're from Estonia.

460
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:19,322
So am I.

461
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,491
Excuse me one moment.

462
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:26,496
(normal voice, sotto voce): Estonia
would close out the Baltics!

463
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:30,867
And I am
street performer like you.

464
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,083
Ay-yi-yi-yi!

465
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:50,520
(knocking)

466
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,621
Hey.

467
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,190
Say yes to this.

468
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:55,258
Okay.

469
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,560
(voice breaking):
Can I move back in?

470
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,664
(sniffling)

471
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,533
Yes.

472
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:08,838
But, Ted, am I just
the biggest idiot in the world?

473
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,041
Look, think about all
of us five years ago

474
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,776
when we first met you.

475
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:16,713
<i>Marshall and Lily were just
boyfriend and girlfriend.</i>

476
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:19,649
<i>Now they're married
and thinking about kids.</i>

477
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,917
<i>And Barney?</i>

478
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:23,553
<i>Barney was never gonna commit
to anyone ever.</i>

479
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:27,223
<i>And last year, he fell in love.</i>

480
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:29,225
<i>And me?</i>

481
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:32,528
<i>I was chasing some girl I was
convinced was "The One."</i>

482
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,898
Now she's one of my
closest friends.

483
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:37,266
And you?

484
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:40,136
Five years ago, you never
would have chosen love

485
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:43,506
over your career,
but today you did.

486
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,875
Looks like I'm getting dumber.
No,

487
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,544
(sighs) just more courageous.

488
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:52,482
Look, we've all been searching

489
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:53,783
for The Five Doppelgangers,
right?

490
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:54,784
Mm.

491
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,452
But eventually, over time,

492
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:58,821
we all become
our own doppelgangers.

493
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:01,657
You know, these... these
completely different people

494
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,761
who just happen to look like us.

495
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:07,463
"Five Years Ago Robin"?

496
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:10,466
That girl, she was pretty great.

497
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,403
But Doppelganger Robin?

498
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,973
She's amazing.

499
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:30,586
We've, um, we've had
a lot to drink...

500
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,054
I don't care.

501
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:38,361
(snickering) What?

502
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,630
(laughing)
Oh. Oh, yeah.

503
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,465
I forgot I'm blonde.

504
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:44,367
I have blonde hair.

505
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:47,003
<i>And that's the story
of how dying my hair blonde</i>

506
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:48,371
<i>kept us from doing something</i>

507
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:50,907
<i>we both would have regretted
that night.</i>

508
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:53,943
<i>Kids, the universe is funny.</i>

509
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,820
Oh, my God!

510
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:06,656
Yes! You're here!

511
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:08,057
This is fantastic!

512
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:09,859
Baby, simmer.
Your husband's right there.

513
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,327
At least attempt
to hide it.

514
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:13,129
Guys, follow me!

515
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,567
Guys, look!

516
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,635
The Fifth Doppelganger!

517
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:24,674
Uh, Lily?

518
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:26,008
That dude looks noth...

519
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,076
MARSHALL: Guys...

520
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:28,611
Go with it.

521
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:33,049
<i>Kids, you can ask the universe
for signs all you want...</i>

522
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,318
It's uncanny.
Right?

523
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,320
Just like Barney.
Amazing.

524
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,121
It's like looking
in the mirror.

525
00:20:39,122 --> 00:20:42,625
<i>But ultimately, we only see
what we want to see</i>

526
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:44,393
<i>when we're ready to see it.</i>

527
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:47,864
So, um, does this mean...?

528
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:49,799
Marshall Eriksen...

529
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,934
put a baby in my belly.

530
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:54,036
Mm...

9999
