1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:03,067
Never know

2
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:04,903
When you're about to meet
someone really important.

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,205
<i>It's not like life
gives you a warning.</i>

4
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:09,882
<i>You just look up
and there they are.</i>

5
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:12,974
Come on, we're going to
go get trashed on the roof.

6
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:14,271
<i>No, not that dude.</i>

7
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:17,142
<i>Her.</i>

8
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:19,615
I'm good, boomer.

9
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:20,917
My name's not boomer.

10
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:23,057
Oh, in my head,
it is. Gentlemen,

11
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:25,901
I'm a faculty member,
and you're underage,

12
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:30,911
So it's my duty to
confiscate this and this and-

13
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:32,044
Hard lemonade?

14
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,312
You know what, boomer?

15
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:34,414
You can keep that.

16
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:35,714
<i>I swear,</i>

17
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:37,316
Every week I get
asked by some frat guy

18
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,955
To a kegger, and I say,

19
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,523
"i'm a phd candidate writing
a dissertation entitled

20
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:42,857
'foreign direct investment

21
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,691
And intergenerational linkages
in consumption behavior.'"

22
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:45,626
(laughs)

23
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:47,929
And what does frat
guy say to that?

24
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,363
(in deep voice): "that's hot."

25
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:51,666
(laughs) actually,
that is kind of hot.

26
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:52,900
(laughs)

27
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,903
Ted, I have a confession. Hmm.

28
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,304
I recognize you.

29
00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:59,974
Do you remember the first
day of classes last semester?

30
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:01,843
Econ 305?

31
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:05,314
<i>Kids, you remember the
wrong classroom story.</i>

32
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,785
<i>I thought I was in architecture
101, but it was econ 305.</i>

33
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:10,622
<i>Of course, what
I didn't know was</i>

34
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:13,092
<i>That your mother was
somewhere in that class,</i>

35
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:15,928
<i>And she thought I
was a complete idiot.</i>

36
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:18,531
I thought you were a
complete idiot. (sighs)

37
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:20,834
But a very cute idiot.

38
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,542
So, um, do you ever
date cute idiots?

39
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:29,446
Almost exclusively.

41
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:44,130
She's a phd candidate,

42
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:45,832
She reads philosophy for fun,

43
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,938
She does the Sunday crossword
every week and finishes it.

44
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,273
Ooh. Barney: Wow,

45
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:53,842
Ted, I am so happy for you
- sorry,

46
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:56,512
<i>Not for you,
happy I'm not you.</i>

47
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:59,482
Long story short: I
have a date tonight.

48
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:01,283
Oh, yay. (hooting and
hollering from the street)

49
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:03,652
(chuckles) hmm?

50
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:06,822
Thanks, new york, I'll
try not to screw it up.

51
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:09,691
What's going on?

52
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,159
There's a huge line
outside maclaren's.

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,828
And why is it almost
entirely dudes?

54
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:17,431
Only two things could cause
that kind of commotion.

55
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:18,565
Boobs.

56
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:21,335
âª she's my cherry pie... âª

57
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:23,105
Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:27,009
Maclaren's has hired
a hot bartender.

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,979
âª sweet cherry
pie, yeah. âª

60
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,681
Look at all these guys.

61
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:33,915
(groans)

62
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,685
The sidewalk's going to
smell like pee-pee now.

63
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,887
Well, we'd better start
looking for a new bar.

64
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,790
What, are you- what,
are you- are you crazy?

65
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,493
It is a hot bartender.

66
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:47,398
Do you know how long I have
been waiting to land a...

67
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,934
My friends, I have been
with many women in my day.

68
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:56,206
Lawyers, teachers,
poets, doctors,

69
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:59,843
Professional equestrians,
amateur equestrians...

70
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:03,380
A butcher, a baker,
a candlestick maker-

71
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,149
Yes, we're to the
rhyming section now-

72
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,220
A math professor, a tax
assessor, a weight guesser...

73
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:12,022
A puppeteer,

74
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:13,323
A blackjack dealer,

75
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:16,092
A stay-at-home mom-
that's a job, too, guys-

76
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:17,560
A circuit court judge...

77
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,661
Get to the point!

78
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:23,700
I have never, ever
scored a hot bartender

79
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,836
Until tonight.

80
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,571
She's really not that hot.

81
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,775
Aw, is someone jealous
of all the attention?

82
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:33,377
Did somebody fancy herself
the hottest girl in the bar?

83
00:03:33,378 --> 00:03:37,615
Gosh, no. Shut up!

84
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,149
All right, wish me luck.

85
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,585
All right, it's
never going to happen.

86
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,585
Barney, she's just going

87
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:42,787
To pretend to like you

88
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:45,323
The same way she hypnotized
all these geniuses.

89
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:47,491
Yeah, but guess who's not
going to fall under her spell?

90
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,460
I'm gonna be all, "drop
the act, baby doll.

91
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:50,761
Daddy needs a gin and tonic."

92
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:51,995
Then when she brings it,

93
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:54,498
I'm gonna just spit it
out and say, "try again."

94
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:57,200
Boom! Alpha dog is
right where he belongs:

95
00:03:57,201 --> 00:04:00,604
On top, then after a few
minutes, on the bottom.

96
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:01,938
Why should I do all the work?

97
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,576
Hi, marshall. Guys,
what's happening?

98
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:07,578
New superhot bartender.

99
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:08,846
Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.

100
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,315
(scoffing): Eh.

101
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:12,451
Ha, ha, see?

102
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,885
Marshall doesn't
think she's hot either.

103
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,853
Yes, he does.

104
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:17,288
Baby, you don't
have to pretend

105
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,058
Other women aren't
attractive just for my sake.

106
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,061
I know, and if that woman
were anywhere near as hot

107
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,163
As the woman I'm married
to, then I'd admit it,

108
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,464
But she's not.

109
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:30,201
Oh, baby, you're so sweet,
but compared to that woman,

110
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,737
I am a big bag of
three-day-old garbage.

111
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,040
Well, I call 'em

112
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,575
Like I see 'em, and...

113
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,478
I just think you're the most
beautiful woman in the world.

114
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,247
See, that's just annoying.

115
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,050
Oh, my god, you are so funny.

116
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,985
That'll be $6.75.

117
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,787
Here's a 50, keep the change.

118
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,389
Oh, thank you.

119
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,558
Amateurs.

120
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:53,692
Hey.

121
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,360
What do you want? Drop
the act, baby doll-

122
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,496
Wait, what? Are
you gonna order

123
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,798
A drink or are you just gonna
stand there looking stupid?

124
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,266
Um...

125
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,568
I don't know how
to make an um.

126
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,303
Is that equal parts vodka and
get-the-hell-out-of-my face?

127
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,106
Hey, bobby!

128
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,707
What's going on?

129
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,108
<i>Later that night, I embarked</i>

130
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:13,443
<i>Upon a very
important first date.</i>

131
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,744
How are you? Good. Come in.

132
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,946
<i>It's funny, sometimes
you walk into a place</i>

133
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:20,316
<i>You've never been before,
but you get the feeling</i>

134
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:23,719
<i>You're exactly where
you're supposed to be.</i>

135
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,155
<i>And kids, that's the
first time I ever saw</i>

136
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:28,625
<i>Your mother's
little yellow bus.</i>

137
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,160
<i>You know the one.</i>

138
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,362
It's right behind you.

139
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,834
Hey, this is cute.

140
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:40,203
Actually, it's my roommate's.

141
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,121
<i>As, kids, standing in
your mother's apartment,</i>

142
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:48,157
<i>Never mind the fact that I
was on a date with her roommate</i>

143
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:49,358
<i>Cindy.</i>

144
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,326
Sorry, I shouldn't be messing

145
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:52,928
With your roommate's stuff.

146
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:54,796
(chuckles) what's she like?

147
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,865
<i>I didn't know it, but
I was about to hear</i>

148
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:00,335
<i>The very first description of
the woman I'd one day marry.</i>

149
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,070
She's a whore.

150
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,006
I think she's a
dominatrix. What?

151
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:08,410
Okay, I'm sorry,
none of that is true.

152
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,511
I have a bit

153
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:11,746
Of a roommate complex. Why?

154
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,683
Guys are always falling
in love with her.

155
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,851
Hey, hey, look at me.

156
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:18,886
I promise you

157
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:21,255
I am not going to fall in
love with your roommate.

158
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,524
<i>Oops.</i>

159
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,360
Okay, now that you've had
a closer look, admit it:

160
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,964
That bartender is the
hottest woman in this bar.

161
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:32,165
(coughing): Second hottest.

162
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,167
I repeat...

163
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:35,669
Eh. (sighs)

164
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,338
Baby, how could you
not want to hit that?

165
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,672
I want to hit that.

166
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:41,107
If you don't want to hit that,

167
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,543
I'm sorry, but
you might be gay.

168
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:45,211
Hell, yeah, I'm gay.

169
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,113
Gay for you.

170
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:48,715
Whatever. Did you find out why

171
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:52,251
I'm the one guy in this entire
bar she seems to despise?

172
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,086
I did, um...

173
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:56,054
You're not going
to like the answer.

174
00:06:56,055 --> 00:07:00,358
My last three boyfriends were
wall street guys- bastards-

175
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,426
So I vowed

176
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,760
Never again to date

177
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,362
A guy who wears suits.

178
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:06,164
Huh.

179
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:07,332
Okay, well, that's easy.

180
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,534
All I have to do is
stop wearing suits. Oh,

181
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:10,736
That's all, barney?

182
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:13,272
Come on, you're
never not in a suit.

183
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:20,046
True... But for those-
I mean, for that-

184
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,215
I mean, for her...

185
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:25,785
I will stop wearing-

186
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:26,886
Wait for it...

187
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:28,387
We know you're
going to say "suits."

188
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:30,556
...Suits.

189
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:31,756
(both gasp)

190
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:32,890
<i>Meanwhile, cindy and I</i>

191
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,359
<i>Were having a lovely evening,</i>

192
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,727
<i>Except she wasn't kidding
about her roommate complex.</i>

193
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:38,695
And another weird
thing about my roommate:

194
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:42,232
She does these bizarre paintings
of robots playing sports.

195
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,467
Yeah, that is weird.

196
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:45,468
<i>I was lying.</i>

197
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:46,703
<i>That sounded awesome.</i>

198
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,137
<i>Your mother's robot
volleyball watercolor</i>

199
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:50,339
<i>Is hanging up in
the den as we speak.</i>

200
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Yeah,

201
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:53,142
And she has this crazy habit

202
00:07:53,143 --> 00:07:55,778
Of making breakfast
food sing show tunes.

203
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,246
That's just bizarre.

204
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,781
<i>Your mother's
rendition of "memories"</i>

205
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,483
<i>As performed by an english
muffin is, to this day,</i>

206
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:05,820
<i>The most hauntingly beautiful
thing I've ever heard.</i>

207
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:07,755
Look, I'm sold.

208
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,156
I hate this girl.

209
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,724
I'm sorry.

210
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,759
Look, she's not that bad.

211
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,527
I just get a little jealous.

212
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:15,428
I don't know why.

213
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,429
You're awesome.

214
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,565
<i>But not as awesome
as your mother.</i>

215
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,734
<i>And speaking of things
that are less awesome,</i>

216
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,469
<i>Your uncle barney had
officially suited down.</i>

217
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,171
I am so sorry

218
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,607
I misjudged you.

219
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,608
If there is

220
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,776
One type of person

221
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,044
That I cannot stand,

222
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,479
It is a man in a suit.

223
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,580
(shudders)

224
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,316
That and a woman
who has no respect

225
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:36,551
For herself. (shudders)

226
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:38,453
Yeah.

227
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:42,224
Suits and insecure women
- I hate 'em.

228
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,726
Just hate 'em.

229
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:47,395
Hey. Hey. Hey, how was

230
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,864
Your date with cindy?

231
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:52,100
Well, last night was
great, today not so much.

232
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,568
What, why?

233
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:54,836
I found out the
school's policy

234
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:58,806
About students and professors
dating is really strict.

235
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,474
I could lose my scholarship.

236
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,743
Yeah, but I-it's not
like you're in my class.

237
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:05,078
I mean, we're not even
in the same department.

238
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,582
I'm sorry, but I
just can't risk it.

239
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,883
(sighs)

240
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:11,219
She's completely
overreacting, right?

241
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,553
Actually, ted,
she has a point.

242
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:13,921
Lily: Yeah, and
think about it.

243
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,657
If the rules are that strict,

244
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:18,260
You could be putting
your job in jeopardy.

245
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:21,196
I think, I think you got
to let this one go, buddy.

246
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:22,398
Let's try this again:

247
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,967
She's completely
overreacting, right?

248
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:26,034
<i>Of course, they were right.</i>

249
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,237
<i>I had to let it go,</i>

250
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,806
<i>But as your uncle barney
was about to find out,</i>

251
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:32,508
<i>It's not so easy
to let things go.</i>

252
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,677
(indistinct,
creepy whispering)

253
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:45,655
<i>(eerie whispering): Suit up.</i>

254
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:47,957
<i>Narrator: Now, none
of us had ever seen</i>

255
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,693
<i>Barney go this long
without suiting up,</i>

256
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:53,129
<i>And kids, it wasn't pretty.</i>

257
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,530
So sorry I'm late.

258
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,098
I got stuck at work.

259
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:57,566
You know how today I
had that presentation

260
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,269
On offshore dividend
tax implications?

261
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,770
Sure, I was totally
paying attention

262
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,305
When you talked about that.

263
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,208
Right, so I fire
up the powerpoint...

264
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,449
Um, barney?

265
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:17,319
Barney. Aah.

266
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:21,457
(panting)

267
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:26,261
(sighs)

268
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,435
<i>(eerie whispering): Suit up.</i>

269
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:35,970
âª âª

270
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:51,586
Marshall: Hey, barney, we're
going to order some food.

271
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:52,821
Okay, be out in a sec.

272
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:54,956
Okay.

273
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,494
Okay.

274
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:00,496
(ripping)

275
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:02,598
No.

276
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,833
Out of the way!

277
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,067
Stay with me.

278
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:06,602
It's not your time.

279
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,938
<i>Narrator: If anyone could
fix something like this,</i>

280
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,640
<i>It was barney's
personal tailor,</i>

281
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,475
<i>Tv's tim gunn.</i>

282
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,310
I'm sorry, barney.

283
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:16,546
I couldn't make it work.

284
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:18,615
(sobbing)

285
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:21,051
So young.

286
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:22,852
There's nothing
else you could do?

287
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,488
No, but there is another suit

288
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,824
That can use the
buttons from your suit.

289
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:29,226
That can...

290
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:31,094
Like an organ donor?

291
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:34,731
Your suit's death could
mean another suit's life.

292
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:37,668
But I...

293
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:40,671
Do it.

294
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:42,773
You're doing the right thing.

295
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,942
(sobbing and muttering)

296
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,211
Please don't cry on this.

297
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:50,079
It's silk. I'm sorry.

298
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,247
I know. I know.

299
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:57,454
We cremated the remains.

300
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,590
His buttons saved the life

301
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,393
Of a sick little jacket
on the upper east side.

302
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:06,497
Well, at least now you
can finally drop this quest

303
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,533
For the so-called
hot bartender.

304
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,534
No.

305
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:12,302
My suit gave its life

306
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:13,904
For this cause,

307
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:17,307
And I will not
rest until those...

308
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:18,608
I mean, that...

309
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:21,977
I mean, she... Is mine.

310
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,783
He's absolutely right.

311
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:31,354
Who, the guy kissing a jar full of dead suit ashes
- that guy?

312
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:33,523
What if cindy is the woman
I'm supposed to marry,

313
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,525
And I'm just giving up?

314
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,894
So long, elegant, yet
welcoming home in westchester

315
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:39,730
With a sensible
mortgage I can handle

316
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,265
Without dipping
into my savings.

317
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:44,235
Bye-bye, two kids I raised
with a stern, yet loving hand,

318
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:45,669
Finding the perfect
balance between

319
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,904
Father and friend.

320
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:50,373
Adios, triplet schnauzers,
frank, lloyd and wright.

321
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:51,407
Ted! Ted! Ted!

322
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:53,108
The point is,

323
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:54,877
I'm not giving up, either!

324
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,246
Ooh. Ooh.

325
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,581
I don't know why
I just did that.

326
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:06,286
Barney, I'm so sorry
about your friend.

327
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,454
Tell me about him.

328
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,590
(laughs) he was italian.

329
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:12,126
Classy, elegant.

330
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,996
And boy, did he have
a way with the ladies.

331
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:16,865
They just couldn't say no.

332
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,601
How old was he? Seven.

333
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,138
I miss him so much!

334
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,574
You shouldn't
be alone tonight.

335
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,743
I'm gonna end my shift early.

336
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:30,847
Thank you, old friend.

337
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:33,449
(voice breaking): You're
going out with a bang.

338
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,285
Lily: Come on, marshall.

339
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,253
Just admit that
she's hotter than me.

340
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:39,854
I won't be hurt.

341
00:13:39,855 --> 00:13:40,988
Can't do it.

342
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:42,189
You're hotter.

343
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,758
Oh, she's a goddess!

344
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,459
Her skin glows.

345
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,327
Her legs go for miles.

346
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,696
And that ass?

347
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:51,098
I would wear that
thing for a hat.

348
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,734
Last night in
bed, I'll admit it,

349
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,803
She popped into my
head a couple of times.

350
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,438
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you try...?

351
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,774
Like, you think
she's hotter than me?

352
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:03,143
I never said that.

353
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,144
Marshall: Oh, my god!

354
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:05,345
You do.

355
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,613
It's apples and oranges.

356
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,148
She's younger than you.

357
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,917
I'm just saying, like,

358
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:12,587
Me in my prime versus
her in her prime.

359
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:13,721
Well...

360
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:14,856
Oh, my god!

361
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:17,827
You guys, her hotness
isn't even real!

362
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:20,930
It's circumstantial hotness.

363
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:22,131
Watch.

364
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,771
âª she's my cherry pie âª

365
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:31,741
âª cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise âª

366
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:34,244
âª taste so good, make
a grown man cry... âª

367
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:38,815
I
- I suppose you think she's hotter than me, too.

368
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:41,051
âª wow! âª

369
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,588
What the hell are
you doing?! What?

370
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:46,623
You're not allowed back here.

371
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,625
Oh, no. Uh, I... Carl, look.

372
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,894
No. I-I don't
want to go back.

373
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:52,495
Please, please,
don't make me go back.

374
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:53,863
You got to go. Don't. I...

375
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:55,265
You got to go. I just...

376
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:58,668
No, carl. I was... I
was somebody back there!

377
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,337
Everybody loved me.

378
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,279
(knocking)

379
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,048
Hey. Hi.

380
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,315
Can we talk?

381
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:15,250
My roommate's just about
to get out of the shower.

382
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:16,452
Let's talk in my room.

383
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:17,987
Okay.

384
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:25,393
(water running)

385
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,396
(sighs)

386
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:28,597
Look, cindy, I know

387
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:30,331
The university rulebook
says we can't date.

388
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:32,133
But it also says,
"don't teach drunk,"

389
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:34,035
And I do that all the time.

390
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:35,536
The point is,

391
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:36,770
I like you.

392
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,738
I do.

393
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,373
You're sweet, you're funny.

394
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:40,307
You're writing a dissertation

395
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,474
Entitled,

396
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,909
<i>Foreign direct investment</i>

397
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,677
<i>And intergenerational linkages
and consumption behavior.</i>

398
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,545
I mean, that is hot.

399
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,982
I know this sounds
crazy, but...

400
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,218
I feel like our paths are
supposed to cross somehow.

401
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:57,322
And I don't want to
miss out on knowing you.

402
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,658
I don't want to miss out
on knowing you, either.

403
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,827
Look, I got to tell you,

404
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,962
I mean, just from
looking around your room,

405
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:08,298
I can tell we have
a ton in common.

406
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,466
Really?

407
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,634
The unicorns?

408
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,836
<i>Who will cut our
hair when we're gone?</i>

409
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:15,839
I have never met anyone
else who has this album.

410
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,108
That's my roommate's.
I borrowed it.

411
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,377
Oh.

412
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,446
Well, well, what about this?

413
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,281
<i>World's end by t.C. Boyle?</i>

414
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,550
That was a birthday
gift... From my roommate.

415
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,285
Haven't checked it out yet.

416
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,953
Oh. Oh, you should.

417
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,388
It's-it's a good read.

418
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,323
Well, what about this?
This is ridiculous.

419
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:34,791
You play bass?

420
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,325
Seriously, ask my friends.

421
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:39,662
I always say,
my ideal woman...

422
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:43,131
Does not play bass, because
this is clearly your roommate's.

423
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,199
She's in a band.

424
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,135
(sotto voce):
Damn, that's cool.

425
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:48,271
This is unbelievable.

426
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:51,007
You just picked out the
only three things in here

427
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,876
That are my roommate's.

428
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:56,480
So, does your roommate's band
ever play shows, or...? Get out.

429
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,384
Narrator: Kids, as
you probably guessed,

430
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:03,120
<i>That wasn't the night
I met your mother.</i>

431
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,392
<i>Although I think I
glimpsed her foot.</i>

432
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,494
<i>But I did get a
little bit closer</i>

433
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:12,629
<i>To meeting the
woman of my dreams.</i>

434
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,464
<i>And your mom-</i>

435
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,866
<i>Well, she got her
yellow umbrella back.</i>

436
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:21,270
It was just so
special, you know?

437
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:24,639
I feel like we should give
him a moment of silence.

438
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,809
Followed by, like, 20
minutes of grunting.

439
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,915
I'm gonna make you
feel all better.

440
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,217
(laughs)

441
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:35,351
Let me just go freshen up.

442
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:36,519
All right.

443
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,555
Oh, wait. No, no,
that's not the bathroom!

444
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:39,756
That...

445
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:42,025
Are these yours?

446
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:46,030
I'm suit-sitting for someone.

447
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,732
Barney, you lied to me.

448
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,367
(sighs)

449
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,636
You have to choose right now.

450
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,038
Me... Or the suits.

451
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,240
(music intro begins)

452
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,546
âª I know what you're thinkin',
"what's barney been drinkin'?" âª

453
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,047
âª that girl was
smokin' hot! âª

454
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,749
âª yes, I coulda nailed her,
but no, it's not a failure âª

455
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,684
âª 'cause there's one
thing she is not âª

456
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,653
âª to score a ten
would be just fine âª

457
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:12,589
âª but I'd rather be
dressed to the nines âª

458
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,560
âª it's a truth
you can't refute âª

459
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:21,631
âª nothin' suits
me like a suit! âª

460
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:23,233
âª picture a world âª

461
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:26,069
âª where all the boys and girls
are impeccably well-dressed! âª

462
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,504
âª that delivery guy
in a jacket and tie âª

463
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,673
âª that puppy in
a double breast! âª

464
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,041
âª that eighties dude
with muttonchops âª

465
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,043
âª that baby with
a lollipop! âª

466
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:40,981
âª that lady cop
who's kinda cute âª

467
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:43,817
âª nothing suits
them like a suit! âª

468
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,785
<i>âª suits! âª âª a
wingman I can wear! âª</i>

469
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:47,754
<i>âª suits! âª âª
they're, oh, so debonair âª</i>

470
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,156
âª suits! âª

471
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,992
âª the perfect way to snare
a girl with daddy issues âª

472
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:54,695
<i>âª suits! âª âª in
navy blue or black! âª</i>

473
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,564
âª check out this
perfect rack âª

474
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:59,834
âª I want to give
them a squeeze âª

475
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:00,902
Oh, really!

476
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:05,040
âª then answer
these questions âª

477
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,243
âª if you please âª

478
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:12,614
âª what would you do
if you had to choose âª

479
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:15,183
âª between your suits
and a pot of gold? âª

480
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,785
âª suits âª

481
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,453
âª what would you say if
you gave your suits away âª

482
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:19,687
âª and in return you'd
never grow old? âª

483
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:20,889
âª suits âª

484
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,456
âª what would you pick:
One million chicks âª

485
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:23,624
âª or a single
three-piece suit?

486
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,859
It's moot.

487
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,660
âª what if world peace
were within your reach? âª

488
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:27,995
(stammering): I'm gonna
stop you right there.

489
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,130
It's suits.

490
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:31,165
Come on, lily, get your
head out of your ass.

491
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,668
Two, three, four!

492
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:38,274
âª girls will go and
girls will come âª

493
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,410
âª but there's only
one absolute! âª

494
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:43,079
âª every bro on the
go needs to know âª

495
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,215
âª that there's no
accepted substitute! âª

496
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,951
âª I'm sorry, suits,

497

Wait for it.

505

00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:47,174
Then again, she is pretty hot.

511
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:48,708
I choose you, baby.

512
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:52,278
First thing tomorrow, I'm
getting rid of these suits.

513
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,646
Really?

514
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:54,881
Yeah.

515
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:56,583
Mmm.

516
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:59,786
Mmm. Mmm.

517
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:01,855
