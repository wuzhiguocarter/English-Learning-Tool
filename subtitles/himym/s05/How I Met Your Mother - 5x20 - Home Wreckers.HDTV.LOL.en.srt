1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:03,588
Kids, everyone
has one or two moments

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:05,233
when they make a huge,
crazy decision

3
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:06,866
that changes their lives
forever.

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:08,806
This is the story of mine.

5
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:11,018
It all started
with a visit from my mom

6
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:12,932
and her longtime boyfriend, Clint,

7
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,036
who was always saying stuff like...
"Ted,

8
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:19,548
Your mother is a very...
Very erotic woman.

9
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:20,718
Please don't.

10
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:24,231
As a painter, slash,
songwriter, slash,

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,731
volunteer fear-fighter,
I find her...

12
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:29,948
incredibly sexual.

13
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:34,206
But you have your own sexual memories
with your mom, don't you?

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,319
Please don't.

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,961
Exiting her womb,
receiving her milk.

16
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:38,942
You get me?

17
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:40,673
Good.

18
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:45,915
I cannot believe I am with that man.

19
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:47,492
Mom, mom, it's ok.

20
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:48,571
You don't have to settle.

21
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:49,782
There are plenty of guys who...

22
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:51,167
He is so cool!

23
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,700
And he picked me!

24
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:58,143
Well, I'm, uh...

25
00:00:58,144 --> 00:00:59,778
I'm glad you're both so happy.

26
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:02,840
Well, good, because we do
have an announcement...

27
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,472
Son.

28
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:16,198
<font color="#EC14BD">Re-sync and corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

29
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:21,427
Yes, my mom was lapping me.

30
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,962
Getting married
for a second time

31
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,453
before I was even married once.

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,152
I was so happy for them.

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,287
So freaking happy.

34
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,414
Still, weddings can be magical.

35
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:33,885
For all I knew, I'd end up sharing
a dance with my future wife there.

36
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,924
And if you don't boil
those jam jars,

37
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:39,737
it's just a welcome mat
for bacteria.

38
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,136
That wasn't her.

39
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:44,587
Oh, congratulations!
Oh!

40
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:46,276
We are so happy for you.

41
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,605
I feel like I'm 19 again. Oh.

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,803
It's like the last 35 years
of my life never happened.

43
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:54,267
So wonderful to hear, mom.

44
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:59,437
Son, to show that your mom and I
will always be there for you,

45
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:04,517
I want you to have this beautiful picture
that I painted.

46
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,268
Kids, there was no guitar.

47
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,962
Excuse me, Ted.

48
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:13,085
Best...Wedding...
E...ver.

49
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:19,200
Hello, everyone.
Mahallow for being here with us.

50
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:21,923
My entire life...

51
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,196
Well, this life.

52
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:28,053
I've waited
for a muse like Virginia.

53
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,498
Baby...

54
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,389
this is your song.

55
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:42,004
* When I squeeze her trembling bosom *
Oh, God...

56
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:45,790
* The blood pumps to my loins *

57
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:49,533
* When I penetrate
her...*

58
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:52,609
Kids, I swear to God, I blacked
out for the next 12 minutes.

59
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,727
So I have no idea how the song
got to this ending.

60
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,956
* And Mahatma Gandhi *

61
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,465
* And the pancakes * Everyone!

62
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,128
* And the dragon *

63
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:07,335
* And you *

64
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,322
Guys, guys! Guess what
Robin just did.

65
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,661
* Red and true...*

66
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,796
Are you crying?

67
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:21,920
I know it's stupid, but...

68
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,185
Everyone!
* And the dragon...*

69
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:28,216
They're happy, you know?

70
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,915
Not as happy as I am, Robin.

71
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:35,925
Guys, guys! Guess what
Robin just did.

72
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,976
And then, I told you guys
what Robin just did,

73
00:03:39,997 --> 00:03:41,340
but you were there for that.

74
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:43,342
I gotta tell the rest
of the wedding.

75
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:44,934
Aunt Meredith!

76
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:47,944
Kids, I can't overstate

77
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:50,159
how horrible it is
to be the single guy

78
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:51,950
at your own mother's
second wedding.

79
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,423
So, Ted, when's your wedding?

80
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,269
So, Ted, when's your wedding?

81
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,186
When's your wedding?
When's your wedding?

82
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:59,616
When's your wedding?

83
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:01,950
Robin cried at Clint's song.

84
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,715
Oh, I told you already.

85
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,230
Ted's hot sister, Heather!

86
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:07,232
I have to leave.

87
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,639
Wait, Ted.
What about your toast?

88
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,284
Make up some emergency
or something. I just...

89
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,567
I-I can't handle this.

90
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,973
Ted, Ted, where are you going?
It's your mother's wedding!

91
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:17,116
Uncle Larry, my hand to God.

92
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:19,043
Niagra Falls.

93
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,557
She's pouring.

94
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,571
And my friends didn't see me
for the next 72 hours.

95
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,384
Seriously, is Ted okay?

96
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:27,438
I mean, I know it was
a rough weekend, but...

97
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:30,255
- this radio silence is weird.
- I know.

98
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:33,137
His mom's called, like, five times
asking where he disappeared to.

99
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:35,570
Sorry, Robin.
They're all out of pretzels.

100
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,327
And I know how
emotional you get.

101
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:40,904
Shh.

102
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,749
Shh. Let it go.

103
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:44,647
Let it go.
Okay!

104
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:45,951
Shh.
Okay, I...

105
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,456
I cried at Clint's song.

106
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,051
She cried at Clint's song.

107
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:51,644
- Hey, guys.
- Ted, where have you been?

108
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:52,559
Are you okay?

109
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,716
Oh, I'm better than okay.
I am on top of the world. Come on.

110
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,454
We're going for a ride!

111
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:01,820
Hey, buddy, do you want to, maybe,
let somebody

112
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:04,314
who isn't having some sort
of manic episode drive for a while?

113
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,544
Yeah, and where the hell
are we going?

114
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,734
First, let me tell you what happened
the night of the wedding.

115
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:11,846
Watching my mom get married,

116
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:14,620
I realized how far behind
I was in my own life.

117
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,310
I just had to get out of there.

118
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,870
So I went back to my hotel room
and got onto this Web site

119
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,495
I sometimes visit
when I can't sleep...

120
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:23,200
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh! Ted,
come on. Oh, God. T.M.I.

121
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:26,233
We do not want to know what you
and the Internet do when you're lonely.

122
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:27,333
I didn't... I...

123
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:30,774
That's not the part of the night
I was talking about.

124
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,374
I went to my favorite
real estate auction site...

125
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:35,621
Come on, we've all got one...

126
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,909
scrolled through
a few properties and...

127
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,843
Guys...

128
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:43,485
I just bought my dream house.

129
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,135
What do you mean
you bought this house?

130
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,946
I mean, I made a bid online.

131
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,217
I won the auction the next day
and I got approval.

132
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:56,060
I just finalized the paperwork.

133
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,066
And was the Blair Witch
easy to deal with,

134
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:01,250
Or did she haggle
over the closing costs?

135
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:02,873
Don't even joke about that, man.

136
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,313
So, I'm thinking this room
will be the study.

137
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,790
You know, a place just for Dad.

138
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,000
I mean, the kids
are welcome in here

139
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,929
if they're reading
a book, but no toys.

140
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:11,798
It's not a question
of withholding love.

141
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:13,520
It's a question
of drawing boundaries.

142
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,480
Whoa.

143
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,076
Ted, this is insane.

144
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,810
This is going to take years

145
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,441
and a small fortune
to make livable.

146
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,659
I'm an architect.
I'll find a way.

147
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,806
And if I start right now,
it'll be done by the time

148
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,522
the ol' wifey and I
are ready to move in.

149
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,402
Is she in the room
with us right now, Ted?

150
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:36,023
Okay, okay, I know
I haven't found Mrs. Mosby yet,

151
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:37,886
but I will, knock on wood.

152
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:40,208
Careful, buddy.

153
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:45,078
Ted, you can't just skip ahead
to where you think your life should be.

154
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,139
Doesn't work that way.

155
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,254
Yeah, I gotta agree. This may be
the stupidest thing you've ever done.

156
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,118
Stupidest thing any of us has
ever done.

157
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:52,024
Okay, all right.

158
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,534
- Let's lay off Ted, all right?
- Thank you.

159
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,494
Alright? We've all done some
stupid things in our lives.

160
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,297
For example, I remember a time

161
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:59,401
when I dropped some
bottle rockets in the toilet,

162
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:02,354
and I tried to dry them
off in the microwave.

163
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,583
God, you must have been
drunk off your ass.

164
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:08,035
No, too stupid to be an adult.
He was obviously a kid when it happened.

165
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:10,583
- Kid? Why...
- Throw rockets in the...

166
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:13,062
Oh, my God, guys!
Great new game:

167
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,645
"Drunk or Kid."
Which one was I?

168
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:16,765
Lock in your guesses.

169
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:17,656
Drunk. Drunk. Kid.

170
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:19,307
Kid.
Drumroll, please.

171
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,085
I was...

172
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,510
Drunk!

173
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,497
You know, I'm glad
Robin got it right.

174
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:35,489
Cause she's very sensitive and fragile.

175
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:41,077
I'm referencing the time
she cried at Clint's song.

176
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:43,396
And even though I'm whispering,

177
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:45,462
I actually hope she hears me.

178
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,715
- It wasn't me!
- What?

179
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,751
I'm not the one who cried
at Clint's song.

180
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,976
Are you... crying?

181
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,355
I know it's stupid, but...
Everyone!

182
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:02,617
* And the dragon...*

183
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:05,153
They're just happy, you know?

184
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,948
Not as happy as I am.

185
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:10,824
I will give you $500 if this just
happened to you instead of me.

186
00:08:10,944 --> 00:08:12,586
500 bucks? Deal.

187
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,389
Thank you, Robin.

188
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,638
You just saved me unspeakable public
humiliation and shame.

189
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:19,532
Guys! Guys!

190
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,843
Guess what Robin just did.

191
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,406
Wait, you guys are...

192
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:27,208
Hi, I'm here
for the inspection.

193
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:29,324
Oh, great! I was worried
you weren't coming.

194
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:32,278
I was actually here a few minutes ago,
but I guess the doorbell doesn't work.

195
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:34,117
Hmm.
Oh, hey!

196
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,743
Doorbell does not work.

197
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:43,456
Wait, wait. You're just getting
this place inspected now?

198
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:44,253
Well, yeah.

199
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,244
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

200
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:47,487
Okay! All right!

201
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:50,521
All right, let's all remember
that we've all done

202
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,051
some stupid things
in our lives, okay?

203
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:54,477
For example, I once
tried to ride my bike down

204
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:57,212
an extension ladder from
the roof of a two-story house.

205
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,124
The only looming question is

206
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:02,870
Was I drunk or a kid?

207
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,719
Drunk! Kid! Kid! Drunk!

208
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:05,924
Drumroll, please.

209
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,376
I was...

210
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,035
Marshall's dead!

211
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:14,218
Marshall's dead!

212
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,113
- A kid.
- Marshall!

213
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,520
Moms, right?

214
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,508
Just always
making a big deal out of nothing.

215
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,963
*** under a week.

216
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,342
Hey, let's check out the porch, huh?

217
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,125
Come on.

218
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,742
I'm going to put
a grill out here.

219
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,216
Every Sunday, right here,

220
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,960
it's going to be
a total sausage fest.

221
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,230
Hmm...
Sausage party?

222
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,881
Burgers, we'll do burgers.

223
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:41,011
Ted, stop it. You can't keep this house.
It's a huge mistake.

224
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:42,317
Lily, listen to me.

225
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,073
I had a plan, okay?
Wife, house, kids.

226
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,011
As it turns out, the Universe

227
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:49,551
it's being kind of a ***
about the whole wife and kids part.

228
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,089
So, what's the one
thing I can control?

229
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:53,655
The house. I bought it.

230
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,652
- It's not a huge mistake.
- Exactly.

231
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:59,329
Now, me driving my brother's car
the wrong way down I-94,

232
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:01,305
that was a huge mistake.

233
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,020
Drunk! Kid! Kid! Kid!

234
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:05,198
I was...

235
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,080
A kid.

236
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:11,367
Yes!

237
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:15,064
Wow, Barney.

238
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:16,896
Did you cry on that
guy or something?

239
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:19,133
Yeah. You got leaky pipes.

240
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,442
But the bright side:

241
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:24,155
the pond in your basement is drowning
some of the larger, slower rats.

242
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,966
The rest of them, well...
they're headed this way.

243
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,229
See, you should have waited to find out
the problems with this house.

244
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,339
You can always find problems
with any decision,

245
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:36,805
but you can't
let that stop you.

246
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:40,370
Freshman year, Marshall knew right away
he wanted to spend his life with you.

247
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,408
What if someone had been there
to second-guess that decision?

248
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,594
Bye.

249
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,670
I know we've only been on two dates, but
dammit, Lily Aldrin, I'm gonna marry you.

250
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,951
Not so fast.

251
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:01,048
We got some
structural issues here.

252
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:04,690
These hips are not
Eriksen baby-compliant.

253
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,161
And this thing right here

254
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,118
does not have a proper filter.

255
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,786
That's a maintenance issue
that's never going to go away.

256
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,085
And I know you think that you
like this Gothic exterior now

257
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:19,325
But deep down, didn't you always
picture yourself in something Spanish?

258
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,535
I'd recommend you look
into the rental option.

259
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,827
But Marshall took that leap of faith,

260
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,732
and it's the best thing
that ever happened to you both.

261
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,608
It was Robin!

262
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:33,700
"What?!"

263
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,723
Yes, it was Robin
who cried at Clint's song!

264
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,789
But she said...I know what she said.

265
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:40,670
But here's what
she didn't want you to know.

266
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,395
Listen, Barney,

267
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,566
I can't stand all these jokes
about me crying.

268
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,132
If I pretend to reveal
that you were the one who cried,

269
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,061
will you go along with it?

270
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,132
Sure.

271
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,598
I made a mistake
letting you go, didn't I?

272
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,371
Your penis is enormous.

273
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,341
- Dude, you almost had us.
- You always take it one too far.

274
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,607
Dammit.

275
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,722
All right, good news.

276
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:08,385
- Think we'll be out of here early.
- Really?

277
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:11,372
Yep, I finished downstairs
and the outside.

278
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:13,786
Now, I could keep looking
and see what else I can find

279
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:16,700
besides the black mold,
the damaged retaining wall,

280
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:18,019
the frayed electrical wires,

281
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,834
the lead paint,
the water damage,

282
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,286
the fire damage,
the sun damage,

283
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,429
the broken furnace,
the rotted floorboards...

284
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:24,991
Oh, look at that. No termites.

285
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:27,185
The cracked chimney,
the bats, the rats,

286
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,125
the spiders,
the raccoons, the hobo,

287
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:30,379
the detached gutter,

288
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,933
the outdated fuse box and
the paint job in the kitchen,

289
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,517
which is fine, but the trim
really clashes with the countertops.

290
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,152
Or I could just recommend

291
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:41,600
that you do not buy this godforsaken
Guantanamo Bay of a house,

292
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:43,775
and suggest that we all
get our asses out of here

293
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,311
before a medium-sized wind
blows the whole sumbitch down.

294
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:52,431
What if I already
bought the sum'bitch?

295
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,591
I- I will check out the upstairs.

296
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,118
Did he say he found a hobo?

297
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,406
Ok, yes. There are problems.

298
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:13,672
But I see this house for what I know it can be.

299
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:16,359
I see a swing
on that tree outside.

300
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,942
I- I see a wreath
on the front door at Christmas.

301
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,665
I see a grill

302
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:23,631
out on that patio where I'll be
barbecuing every weekend.

303
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:28,191
I see a life that I know
I can have here.

304
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,429
I see a lawsuit.

305
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:39,227
Found termites.

306
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:48,910
Hey, well, the good news is the inspector
killed some roaches on impact.

307
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,714
Oh, hold on.

308
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:54,440
Giant pole in second floor.

309
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,781
Just wanted to make sure
the report is thorough.

310
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,781
You were right.

311
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,414
This was a huge mistake.
It's just...

312
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,769
Everyone's moving on but me.

313
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:09,384
You guys got a place years ago;
Robin's getting serious with Don.

314
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:11,987
Barney...Maybe that's a new tie?

315
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,470
Thank you. Geez.

316
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,251
Now my mom is remarried.

317
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:20,580
I... I'm exactly where I was
five years ago. I'm sick of it. I'm...

318
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:24,310
I'm ready for the life
that fits into this house.

319
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:27,084
It's all right, buddy.

320
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,341
Sometimes people make
the wrong decisions in life.

321
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,588
Like your mother.

322
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,399
What do you mean?

323
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,848
Ted, as you know, I've always been

324
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:42,380
very, very fond of your mother.

325
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,045
Please don't.

326
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:47,060
In fact, Virginia and I shared
a special moment back in

327
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,215
2006 B.C....

328
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:51,689
Before Clint.

329
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,552
What the hell are
you talking about?

330
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,090
I wanted to be your dad!

331
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,108
- What does that even mean?
- Don't you talk back to me, young man.

332
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,737
That's why I cried at Clint's song.

333
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:05,347
Because that bastard
took her away from me.

334
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,926
And now, all I'm left with...

335
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,493
is the memory of dropping
her off at the airport.

336
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:15,581
And that's how you
got the brooch?

337
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,215
Unbelievable.

338
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,110
You...

339
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,685
So...Here we are.

340
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:27,672
Here we are.

341
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:32,298
We made good time...
Not a lot of traffic...

342
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,211
Oh, I love this song.

343
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,330
Do you?
Hmm.

344
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,679
I can...

345
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,474
Listen...

346
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,212
Ted's mom.

347
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:53,138
I...

348
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,613
should really...I sh...

349
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:01,722
* Workin' on our night moves *

350
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:06,873
* Tryin' to make some
front-page drivin' news *

351
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:09,912
* Workin' on our night moves *

352
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,930
Your penis is enormous.

353
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,703
Again?! Always one too far!

354
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:18,482
Okay, all right.
Fine, that last part I made up,

355
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:20,379
but the rest of it,
I swear it was true.

356
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:22,540
Come on, dude.
Your mom is a cougar.

357
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,056
Wait, I thought you said
a cougar can't be over 50.

358
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:27,348
Okay, she's a Mellencamp.

359
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:31,611
Guys, I am screwed. I mean, the best
I can do is level this place

360
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:33,990
and sell the property
for a huge loss.

361
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,597
Look, Ted...

362
00:16:36,043 --> 00:16:39,789
Usually in life when you make a stupid
decision you just have to live with it.

363
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:44,746
But how often do you get the chance
to pick up a sledgehammer

364
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:47,156
and bash the living hell
out of it?

365
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,781
- This is stupid.
- Your mom and I got to second base.

366
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:07,407
* I'll light the fire *

367
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:12,685
* You place the flowers
in the vase *

368
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:16,889
* That you bought today *

369
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:29,458
Thanks, Lily.
That felt fantastic.

370
00:17:29,852 --> 00:17:32,412
To Ted Mosby-
homeowner,

371
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:36,356
friend, and if he can
rent it out, slumlord.

372
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,722
There's, uh...

373
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,626
There's one last thing I gotta do.

374
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,925
And my friends didn't see me
for the next 72 hours.

375
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:50,531
He was our ride.

376
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:01,216
- Hi.
- Ted, what are you doing here?

377
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:03,631
I never got to give
you guys your toast.

378
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,625
I was selfish and I freaked out
and I'm so sorry, so...

379
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,532
Here it is...

380
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:14,394
"How bout a hand for the deejay?
Gesture to dee..."

381
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,940
I'll skip down.

382
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:19,417
"Mom, I love you,

383
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,529
"and I've never seen you
as happy as you are with Clint.

384
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:25,620
"And, Clint, welcome to the family...

385
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:29,735
"What you two have
is what I one day hope to find."

386
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,441
But until then, cheers to you both.

387
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,668
I love you, guys.

388
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:37,943
Ted...

389
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:42,460
I am so...

390
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,548
baked right now.

391
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:50,336
I'm only 60% sure you're actually
standing in front of me.

392
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:54,070
But if you are, I love you.

393
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:58,109
And you are the best son
a mother could ever have.

394
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:14,791
There was no logical reason why
my mother should be with a guy like that.

395
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,909
And yet, as you kids know,

396
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:20,515
being with your Grandpa Clint was
the best decision your grandma ever made.

397
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:27,298
Sometimes our best decisions
are the ones

398
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:28,755
that don't make
any sense at all.

399
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:40,087
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

400
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:41,709
How did you know I was
gonna be up here today?

401
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,149
Robin told me.

402
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:46,216
Happy housewarming.

403
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:51,014
But I-I, I told you the last time
I saw you I'm selling the place.

404
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,041
I know what you said.

405
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:56,642
I also know my best
friend, Ted Mosby.

406
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:58,216
Look...

407
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:01,942
Of all the times over the years
when I've said to you

408
00:20:02,763 --> 00:20:05,032
"Slow down! Don't rush
into things with this girl."

409
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:07,746
you haven't listened to me
a single damn time.

410
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:12,215
Your heart is both
drunk and a kid.

411
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,304
- Thanks for sticking up for me, man.
- That's what I do.

412
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:26,480
Can I... Can I tell you some
of the ideas I have?

413
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:27,970
Yeah.

414
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,982
And, kids, Marshall was right.

415
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:32,917
I didn't give up
on my dream house

416
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:35,175
because that's the thing
about stupid decisions:

417
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:36,716
We all make them.

418
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,403
But time is funny.

419
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,715
And sometimes a little magic...

420
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:47,566
It can take
a stupid decision...

421
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:51,219
...and turn it
into something else entirely.

422
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:54,672
Because, kids, as you know,

423
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,242
That house....

424
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:00,911
is this house.
