00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,052
<i>y of my stories
I'm a starry-eyed romantic</i>

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,221
<i>on a noble search
for true love.</i>

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,790
<i>In this one, I'm just a jerk.</i>

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:13,428
Well, guys,
tonight is the night.

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,130
to see my antique
camera collection.

6
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:17,332
Ah!
It's Ted's bait.

7
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,399
"Bait"?

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,635
A true gentleman
invents a pretense

9
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:22,937
to lure an honorable lady
into his apartment.

10
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:25,406
Some item of interest
or beauty you can both

11
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:26,908
pretend to admire
for five minutes

12
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:29,377
before she hops
on your disco stick.

13
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:30,945
Like she's coming up
to "borrow a book"

14
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,981
or "check out an album
on vinyl."

15
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,315
Or to see your
new rap poster.

16
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,050
"Rap poster"?

17
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:37,285
Who would that work on?

18
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:39,454
It was the first
week of college.

19
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,422
I was really
into Wu-Tang Clan.

20
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,925
Yeah, bait is tricky.

21
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:46,694
It has to be something interesting
enough to get the girl upstairs,

22
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,030
but not so interesting
that it overpowers the night.

23
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,432
<i>BARNEY: I found that a
slot machine was too fun.</i>

24
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,635
(coins clinking)
(yelling)

25
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,904
<i>And a trampoline...</i>

26
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,907
turned out to be too dangerous.

27
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,344
<i>But then I found
the perfect bait:</i>

28
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,580
<i>a teacup pig.</i>

29
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,651
"A teacup pig"?
Who's that working on?

30
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,819
You have a teacup pig?! I
didn't know you had a teacup pig!

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,787
Can we see the teacup pig?!

32
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:15,056
Hey, can I borrow
your teacup pig?

33
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:17,091
Yes, you can borrow
my teacup pig.

34
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,693
You have a teacup pig?!
Oh, my gosh!

35
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:19,961
I can't believe
you have a teacup pig!

36
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:21,062
You're just so cute!

37
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:23,231
Yes, you are the cutest
piggy ever!

38
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,099
What?

39
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,734
Were you always this pretty?

40
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:28,269
Or are you going
to give me that whole,

41
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,905
"Oh, in high school I was
really shy and awkward" line?

42
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,807
<i>I was shy and awkward.</i>

43
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:34,342
I was, like,
a hundred pounds heavier

44
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:36,944
and I had these crazy
buck teeth. Seriously?

45
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:39,247
No, I've always been hot.

46
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:41,849
What are you going to do?
(chuckles)

47
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:46,120
Do you know who else
would love this teacup pig?

48
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,789
Hmm?

49
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,524
My boyfriend.

00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,595
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

51
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,306
You have a boyfriend?

52
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:06,474
Ugh, I know.

53
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:08,609
So annoying, right?
I mean, he's

54
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,411
<i>not really my boyfriend.</i>

55
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:12,347
Oh, good.
I mean,

56
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:14,048
technically, he kind of is.

57
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,783
Well, is he or isn't he?

58
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:19,153
Some of both,
but definitely not either.

59
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:21,122
Are you getting any of this?

60
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:24,625
Look, I really like you.

61
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,794
I just need you
to be patient.

62
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:30,631
I don't want to lose you,
Big Brown Eyes.

63
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:35,503
Yup. Somebody doesn't
want to lose

64
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,971
Big Brown Eyes.

65
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:38,539
ROBIN:
Oh, Ted.

66
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,575
She's got you
on the hook.

67
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,610
What? What?
I'm not on the hook.

68
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,779
Oh, you are totally on the hook.

69
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,280
She's stringing
you along.

70
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,715
She's not
committing to you,

71
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,717
but she's keeping you
around just in case,

72
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,987
like an old can of chili
in the pantry.

73
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:54,322
Um, who's buying
canned chili

74
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:57,392
and not eating it
immediately? Amen, sister.

75
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,461
Ted, don't feel bad.
We've all been there.

76
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,596
I've been on both
sides of it.

77
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,164
I've been a hookey
and a hooker.

78
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,599
Move past it, guys.

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
I've been a little
bit loose,

80
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:08,069
but money never
changed hands.

81
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,671
I've been on the hook.

82
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,740
Lisa Walker.
Picture it:

83
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:16,411
1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.

84
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:19,981
So I was, like,
thinking, Lisa-

85
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:24,752
do you maybe want to,
like, go out with me?

86
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:27,188
That sounds great.

87
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,257
But I'm sort
of seeing this guy.

88
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:30,525
He's got
a LeBaron convertible

89
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,093
and an "in"
at the roller rink,

90
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:34,262
so I'd hate
to burn that bridge.

91
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:38,399
I understand.

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,034
But how about this?

93
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,636
You can be
my secret boyfriend

94
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,271
who does all my
homework for me.

95
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,775
A'ight.

96
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,945
You want to see
my rap poster?

97
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,814
Poster whore.

98
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,382
MARSHALL:
Anyway...

99
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:57,084
Lisa Walker strung me
along for months

100
00:03:57,085 --> 00:04:00,354
until one night,
I went to go tell her

101
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:01,656
how much I loved her.

102
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:02,857
BOTH: Aww. Hmm. Ugh.

103
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:04,058
In song.

104
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,393
(all groaning)

105
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:06,661
<i>MARSHALL:
She wasn't home yet,</i>

106
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,896
<i>so I waited.</i>

107
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,567
<i>And waited.</i>

108
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:17,138
<i>I woke up four hours later,
covered in snow.</i>

109
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,173
<i>And that's when I saw it.</i>

110
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:22,643
<i>Lisa's footsteps.</i>

111
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:25,980
<i>She had walked right over me
and into the house.</i>

112
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,016
It was the best thing
that could have happened.

113
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,485
It got me off her hook.

114
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,019
<i>Okay, that is
definitely not</i>

115
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,488
what's going on
with me and Tiffany.

116
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,822
Listen to this.

117
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:37,925
I'm really into you.

118
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:41,362
I just can't be
with you right now.

119
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:44,131
Huh?! Huh?!

120
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,834
Ted, "right no"
is the classic

121
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,436
on-the-hook catchphrase.
MARSHALL: Yup.

122
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:51,272
"Right now" paints a picture of
some sort of magical future time

123
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,373
when everything will work out,

124
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:55,309
but the truth is,
that will never happen.

125
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,210
BARNEY:
It's like this.

126
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:59,080
"I can't be with you." Boom!

127
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,648
"Right now."

128
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,783
(creaking)

129
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:04,852
LILY:
Yeah.

130
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:06,521
I think my high school
boyfriend, Scooter,

131
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,256
is still sort of
on the hook for me.

132
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,324
Sort of?
He totally is.

133
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:13,160
The poor guy showed up at our
wedding hoping to win you back.

134
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,428
LILY:
Yeah.

135
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:15,563
It's still sometimes weird

136
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,632
when I see him at work.
Wait. What?

137
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,568
Scooter works in
the school cafeteria.

138
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,036
We've talked about this.

139
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,671
Hey, Lily.
Nice dress.

140
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,506
Tater-tots?

141
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:27,441
(mouthing)

142
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,512
We most certainly have
not talked about this!

143
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:32,680
Yes, we have.

144
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,515
I've mentioned it
tons of times.

145
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,384
"Lunch Lady Scooter."

146
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,386
I thought that
you were referring

147
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:41,088
to some sort of long overdue
device that carries around

148
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,758
those poor,
underappreciated lunch ladies!

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,193
This explains a lot.

150
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,763
Lunch Lady Scooter
was there again today.

151
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,232
Oh, yeah? Did you
jump on that thing?

152
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,501
Give it a ride?
No!

153
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:55,937
Really? If it were me,
I'd be riding that scooter

154
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,906
all day long until I broke
that thang in half.

155
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,476
So those poor women still
have to walk everywhere?

156
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,479
Wait. Scooter is working
at your school?!

157
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,082
Are you jealous?

158
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,284
No, I just feel bad
for Scooter.

159
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,919
'Cause the only reason
he took that job

160
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,254
is he thinks
he has a shot with you.

161
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:15,222
You have to make it clear
that he doesn't,

162
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,491
so that he can move on
and a real lunch lady

163
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:19,327
can get her
job back. Damn!

164
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:21,195
I've tried.

165
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,697
Hey, Lily.

166
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:26,133
I saw you had seventh period
free. So do I.

167
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,802
You want to run away together?

168
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,504
Let me be clear, Scooter.

169
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:34,542
There is no way you and I
can ever be together.

170
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,218
Right now.

171
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,519
I'll see you tomorrow, Lily.

172
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,455
It's Tijuana Tuesday.

173
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,459
"Right now"?

174
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,827
You right-now'd Scooter?

175
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:55,630
You need to let Scooter
off the hook once and for all.

176
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,697
LILY:
You're right.

177
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:57,832
Day after tomorrow,

178
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,333
that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

179
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,668
Why not tomorrow?

180
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,838
Baby, I can't ruin
Tijuana Tuesday.

181
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,807
Really?

182
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:09,610
You're really going to sit here
all night watching the door

183
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:12,446
because Tiffany said
she'll "try to stop by"?

184
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,782
Barney, I'm not going
to just give up on her.

185
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:17,051
NARRATOR:
I should have given up on her.

186
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,520
This girl is special.

187
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,023
<i>She was the devil.</i>

188
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,291
Things are going
to work out with Tiffany.

189
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,894
<i>No, they're not, dumbass.</i>

190
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:30,431
Ted, let me be clear:
this girl is a poison

191
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:33,334
and you need to cut her
out of your life forever.

192
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,804
Hey, there she is.

193
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,575
Oh, she brought
some of her coworkers.

194
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,448
Hang on to this girl, Ted.

195
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:49,650
Hang on to her
and never let go!

196
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,603
these are some of the
hottest girls I've ever seen.

197
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,138
And they all work with Tiffany?

198
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,107
Yup.
There could only be

199
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,175
one explanation for this.

200
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:06,211
Ted...

201
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:07,879
is Tiffany a ph-ph-ph...

202
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,215
pharmaceutical sales rep?

203
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:11,383
Yeah, how did you know that?

204
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,417
And you never thought

205
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:14,586
to mention that?

206
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,421
What? It's just a job.

207
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:17,756
(stammers)

208
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:20,725
Just a j... just a jah...

209
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:23,728
Ted, throughout time

210
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,064
there has always been one
cutting-edge profession

211
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:28,967
to which hot girls,
like Tiffany, have flocked.

212
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,235
Shall I walk you
through the history?

213
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,936
I'm gonna explicitly say no.

214
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:35,206
It all started
2.5 million years ago.

215
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,308
<i>BARNEY:
Man was a hunter.</i>

216
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,211
<i>So, the hottest
profession of the day?</i>

217
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:41,312
<i>Gatherer.</i>

218
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,748
Homo erectus indeed.

219
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,353
<i>As man mastered technology,</i>

220
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:50,855
<i>the hottest profession
of the day evolved.</i>

221
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,424
I'm pretty sure
it's a hernia.

222
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,592
Can you check again?

223
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,165
<i>And then,
man took to the skies.</i>

224
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,734
<i>And so, hot women
put on high heels</i>

225
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:04,269
<i>and became stewardesses.</i>

226
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:08,473
I am in the upright
and locked position.

227
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,946
And then man said,
"Life is hard.

228
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:17,415
I should start taking
lotsf prescription drugs."

229
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,583
And so, hot girls

230
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,318
rolled into doctors' offices,

231
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,787
looking sexy enough to render
the very erection pills

232
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,422
they peddled
ironically redundant.

233
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:25,623
So now,

234
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:27,559
pharma girls are today's

235
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
hottest profession.

236
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,597
Hey, Big Brown Eyes.
How you doing?

237
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,799
I'm good.

238
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,201
Hey, by the way, you, uh,

239
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:38,203
you ditch that
loser boyfriend yet?

240
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,838
No, sir.

241
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,576
Touched my nose.

242
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:48,113
Dude, ditch Tiffany
and join the Barnacle

243
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,014
in a pharma girl free-for-all.

244
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:52,684
Side effects may include
loss of clothing, rug burn,

245
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:55,220
shortness of breath and sore
abdominals the next morning.

246
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,188
What in the world is up?!

247
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,826
Hey. So...

248
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:03,461
I know that you've
been having trouble

249
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,296
letting Scooter off the hook.

250
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:07,599
Well, I decided what you need
is practice.

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,635
Now, you say the problem
is his cute, sad eyes?

252
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:12,737
Well...

253
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,376
Aww!

254
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,645
All right, shut it, woman.

255
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,181
Now, I want you
to look at this

256
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:26,217
teacup pig and tell him
that there's no way

257
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,319
that you could ever be with him.

258
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,126
Teacup Pig, there is no way

259
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,428
I can ever be with you.

260
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:46,671
Right now.

261
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:48,439
Oh, come on!
Grow a pair!

262
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,441
I'm sorry, but he's

263
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,610
just so freakin' cute.

264
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,013
I just want to cuddle him
all day long.

265
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:57,048
Yes, I do.
You know that's funny.

266
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,651
I remember when you used to say
things like that about me.

267
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,152
Oh, I still do.

268
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,888
Yeah, not as much, Lily.

269
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,890
Not as much.

270
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,359
(laughs)

271
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,061
âª Ain't no party like
a pharma girl party âª

272
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:12,030
âª 'Cause a pharma girl
party don't stop! âª

273
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,766
Dude, I have already hooked
up with three of them.

274
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:15,934
Fantasmo.

275
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:17,869
Plus, my cholesterol
is down.

276
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,404
My restless legs
syndrome is cured.

277
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,372
I've never felt
more alive- oh.

278
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,108
Guys, great news.

279
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:25,810
Tiffany broke up
with her boyfriend.

280
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,245
Proof that I am
not on the hook.

281
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:28,680
Oh, you're still on the
hook. (Lily chuckles)

282
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:32,016
Ah, uh-uh, listen
to how we spent last night.

283
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:34,219
<i>First, we cuddled.</i>

284
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:40,124
Then, we shared chocolate cake.

285
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,895
<i>Then, well, I don't usually
join in on locker room talk,</i>

286
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:48,233
<i>but I gave her
a pretty sensual foot rub.</i>

287
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:54,339
And let me guess: it didn't
go any further than that.

288
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,506
Well, no, but...

289
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,508
And tell me,
did you by any chance

290
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,177
make that chocolate cake?

291
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,346
It was a mix.

292
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:02,313
Dude.

293
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,616
There's no shame
in admitting it, Ted.

294
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:06,551
We've all been
on people's hooks

295
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:08,953
and we've all kept
someone on the hook.

296
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,855
Um, I most certainly
have not.

297
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,923
(scoffing):
What?!

298
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,157
Are you joking?

299
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:16,327
What about that girl from
the university library?

300
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:17,929
Um, Henrietta?

301
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,031
Henrietta and I
are just friends.

302
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,233
Oh, she is so
on your hook.

303
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:24,002
Absolutely not.

304
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:25,703
<i>NARRATOR:
She totally was.</i>

305
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,904
<i>I mean...</i>

306
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:28,673
<i>we cuddled.</i>

307
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:31,276
(sighs)

308
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,012
<i>We shared chocolate cake.</i>

309
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:35,546
(chuckles)

310
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,316
<i>She gave me foot rubs-
long ones.</i>

311
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,885
<i>I'm not proud, kids.</i>

312
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,654
You like having Henrietta
around for the same reason

313
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:44,756
that Tiffany likes
having you around:

314
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:46,958
it's a nice
little ego boost.

315
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,359
No wonder
you're such an expert

316
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,194
about keeping people
on the hook.

317
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:52,430
What about that poor
camera guy you work with?

318
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,098
Mike and I are
just friends.

319
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,800
Come on.

320
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,535
Mmm...

321
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:00,338
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

322
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:01,706
Robin, have you
ever thought

323
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,941
about taking us
to the next level?

324
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,610
Well, if you're talking
about doing my laundry,

325
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:06,711
I'm on board.

326
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,179
You got yourself a deal.

327
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,847
Hmm.

328
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:10,848
What?!

329
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,917
I- I am not keeping
Mike on the hook.

330
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,752
You are Captain Hook.

331
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,287
Dude, I'm a girl.

332
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,790
Okayour girl parts
are like a spiderweb.

333
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,858
Sometimes you're gonna
catch stuff you don't want.

334
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:22,393
That doesn't

335
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:23,494
make it okay.

336
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,730
Oh, a-and Henrietta
is in, in no way

337
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:27,165
wasting her time
with you, right?

338
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,133
Henrietta knows
that we're just friends.

339
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,835
In fact,
I'm gonna call her up

340
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:34,038
and hang out with her tonight
as friends.

341
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,540
Hey, Ted.
Hey.

342
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,774
I love you.

343
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,376
What?
Uh, do you want a foot massage?

344
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,545
'Cause I've been practicing
on myself.

345
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:42,580
No, I'm good.

346
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,048
I didn't know
if you were hungry,

347
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,417
so I just threw together some...
it's not a big deal.

348
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:49,087
<i>Kids, looking back,
I don't know how I didn't see</i>

349
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,222
<i>that Henrietta was madly
in love with me.</i>

350
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:52,290
(phone rings)

351
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,926
Oh.

352
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,961
Hello.
Hey, Ted.

353
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:57,962
Hey, Tiffany.

354
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:58,930
I'm going out of town

355
00:13:58,931 --> 00:13:59,964
this weekend
for my friend's wedding.

356
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,400
Want to be my date?

357
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,668
I would love to.

358
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,136
Hey, what are you doing
right now?

359
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,904
Oh, God, no.

360
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:09,307
Awesome. Okay, I'll see you
in, like, ten minutes?

361
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,608
Great.

362
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:12,310
Soy, Henrietta,

363
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,344
something came up.

364
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:15,279
Take a rain check, pal?

365
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,748
Yeah, it's no problem.

366
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,616
All right, yeah, hey-ho.
Oh, you're strong.

367
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:21,419
<i>What a jerk.</i>

368
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,088
Henrietta, I...

369
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,890
Wait. Where
did Ted go?

370
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,592
I thought we were finally
going to get to meet him.

371
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:28,793
Yeah, something came up,
okay, Mom?

372
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:32,397
I told you
there was no Ted.

373
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,899
I heard that.

374
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:41,074
<i>So there I was,
at one of the surest signs</i>

375
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:43,477
<i>of taking a relationship
to the next level:</i>

376
00:14:43,478 --> 00:14:45,278
<i>an out-of-town wedding.</i>

377
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,713
<i>It was finally happening.</i>

378
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:47,981
Champagne?

379
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,917
Ted, oh, my gosh,
I forgot to call you.

380
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,352
Well, whatever it is
you wanted to talk about,

381
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:53,687
we can talk about it now.

382
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:56,790
This is Jack.

383
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,492
He's the best man
at the wedding.

384
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:00,661
We just got back together.

385
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:01,962
You know, now that
I think about it,

386
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:03,730
a phone call
would have been nice.

387
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:06,667
You're Ted? Ouch.

388
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:09,536
But I hear you make
a mean chocolate cake.

389
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,041
Oh, isn't he great?

390
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:16,376
And he's in a band.
(squeals)

391
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:19,046
Thanks.

392
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,348
Come on, Lily. You have
to get Scooter off the hook.

393
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:22,516
Now, try again.

394
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:25,886
Teacup Pig, oh...

395
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:28,622
I don't want to be with you.

396
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,997
Right now.

397
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:39,399
Man up!

398
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:43,804
Teacup Pig...

399
00:15:43,805 --> 00:15:45,772
I don't want to be with you.

400
00:15:50,478 --> 00:15:51,978
Ever.

401
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:53,380
Finish him!

402
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:55,415
We will never be together

403
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,385
in any sort of sexual way
ever again.

404
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,553
Nice.

405
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:02,022
Sort of a weird thing
to say to a pig.

406
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,190
It felt really wrong.

407
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,360
Anyway, I just don't think
you and I are going to work.

408
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:09,930
(whispers):
Right now.

409
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,132
<i>NARRATOR:
And that's when it hit me.</i>

410
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,433
<i>I was on the hook.</i>

411
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:14,935
<i>I also realized...</i>

412
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,204
I missed this
so much, baby.

413
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:19,206
<i>...Tiffany was
on this guy's hook.</i>

414
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,640
<i>It was a vicious cycle.</i>

415
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,209
<i>Henrietta was on my hook.</i>

416
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,444
<i>And years later, I found out
this poor bastard</i>

417
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,012
<i>was on Henrietta's hook.</i>

418
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,617
You know what?

419
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:33,220
We're not going to work ever.

420
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:35,989
I'm done.

421
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,627
And it's really better
for the circulation

422
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:42,696
if you knead the arches
with your thumbs.

423
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,197
Now, I'm done.

424
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:49,703
Marshall, I can
do this by myself.

425
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,304
Okay, well, then prove it.

426
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:54,274
And, um...

427
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,309
Grab me a pudding.

428
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,881
Listen up, Scooter.

429
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:04,050
There is no way
you and I will ever be together.

430
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:13,160
Right now!
Marshall!

431
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:16,563
I'm sorry, but he's
adorable. Listen.

432
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:17,898
I don't want to be with you.

433
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,733
Right now.
Hang in there, Scoots!

434
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,468
I'm not going to live forever.

435
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,938
Last night I was with
this pharma girl who was

436
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,439
so hot, you should call a doctor

437
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,242
if you don't have an erection
for more than four hours.

438
00:17:29,243 --> 00:17:31,511
Am I right, people?

439
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,546
Yeah, there's no people-

440
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:34,848
just the girl
you most recently dated.

441
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:36,116
(clicks tongue)

442
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,584
Hey, Barney.

443
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:39,920
I want you to meet
the newest pharma girl.

444
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:40,987
Oh.

445
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:41,988
Gladys Reynolds.

446
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,423
Nice to make
your acquaintance.

447
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:47,194
I represent statins and other
cholesterol-lowering drugs.

448
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:49,296
Come on, girl.
Let's go get our drink on.

449
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:53,433
It's over.

450
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:54,634
What's over?

451
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:58,905
Pharma girls are no longer
exclusively hot chicks.

452
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,341
It's the en.
You're being

453
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,375
a little dramatic.

454
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:03,743
Am I?

455
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:05,478
It starts out with a Gladys.

456
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,747
Next thing you know,
a few not-so-fabulous

457
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,316
gay guys enter the ranks.

458
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:10,684
And before
you know it,

459
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,986
pharma girls look like the crew

460
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:16,089
on a Southwest flight
from Albuquerque to Little Rock.

461
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:19,860
It's over!

462
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,929
<i>So that night, I went
straight to Henrietta's-</i>

463
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,931
<i>all set to let her
off the hook.</i>

464
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:34,975
This is Jack.

465
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,710
He's the best man
at the wedding.

466
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,883
I'm done.

467
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:48,321
Yes!

468
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:50,523
The answer is yes!

469
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,293
No.

470
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,829
Oh, it gets worse.

471
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,364
It's perfect!

472
00:18:57,365 --> 00:19:00,333
Mom, Dad!
Ted proposed!

473
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:02,836
Oh, my God!
I knew this day would come!

474
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:03,870
(stammering)

475
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,072
Son!
Yeah, well, there's been a...

476
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:08,975
No. What did you do?

477
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:12,846
I seriously considered
just marrying her

478
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,347
out of sheer awkwardness.

479
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,583
But I did what I had to do.

480
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:20,220
I did what anyone keeping
someone on the hook should do.

481
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:21,855
I broke her heart.

482
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,257
Henrietta, I'm sorry
if this is blunt,

483
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:26,026
but I think
I owe you this.

484
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,030
I don't want to be with you.

485
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:32,532
Right now?

486
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,401
Ever.

487
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,838
But we're still
getting married, right?

488
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,475
It was brutal.

489
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:43,877
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

490
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,845
Honesty is tough,
but in the end,

491
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:48,214
it is the far kinder
alternative.

492
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:50,050
Yeah.

493
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,118
Hey, sweetie.

494
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,155
Hey, Mike.

495
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:57,424
I have to tell
you something.

496
00:19:58,225 --> 00:20:00,226
Wait. Did you finish
my delicates?

497
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:02,562
Got one more load.
Ah, it can wait.

498
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:07,734
I...

499
00:20:13,454 --> 00:20:15,088
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?

500
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,490
Still in mourning over the end
of the pharma girl era?

501
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:20,059
No. I realized
that their reign

502
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,929
had to end to make room for some
new hot girl profession.

503
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:27,667
Maybe it'll be intergalactic
communications officer

504
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:30,003
on a rocket ship
to some distant solar system

505
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,804
we can't possibly imagine.

506
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:34,407
Maybe it'll be... meter maids.

507
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:35,742
We just don't know.

508
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,978
But one thing is sure.

509
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:43,816
The future glows
like a giant sun

510
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:48,488
shooting amber rays of light
into our hearts and minds.

511
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:52,525
Wow, uh,
what changed your mind?

512
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:55,561
The realization that hope
springs eternal, Robin.

513
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,731
That and this little
bottle of purple pills

514
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:00,700
I found in my couch cushion.

515
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,703
Don't know what they are,
but they are amazing!
