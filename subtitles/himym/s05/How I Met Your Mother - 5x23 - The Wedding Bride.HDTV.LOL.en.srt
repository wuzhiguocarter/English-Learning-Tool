00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:04,420
<i>Kids, when you're
in your 2os dating is great,</i>

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,029
<i>but by the time you reach your
3os, you find out pretty fast</i>

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:08,512
<i>everyone has baggage.</i>

4
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:10,390
<i>Sure, you can stick
to the small talk</i>

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,950
<i>and pretend it's not there,
but sooner or later...</i>

6
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:15,252
It's my ex.

7
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:17,390
Sorry. We're trying
to remain friends.

8
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,156
Hi, pumpkin!

9
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:21,759
Did you get our
tickets to Maui?

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,363
<i>Yeah, it's there.</i>

11
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:35,071

12
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,828
That spring I just started dating
a girl named Royce.

13
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:44,750
<i>She was smart, beautiful...</i>

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,550
Blah-blah-blah,
we're very happy together.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,295
But...

16
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:49,408
Exactly.
That's the problem.

17
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:50,492
Her butt?

18
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:51,826
What is it, too much?
Too little?

19
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:54,462
Or is it an issue of access?

20
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:57,665
No, the "but" is, there's
always gonna be a "but."

21
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,234
No matter how great things
are going,

22
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,069
sooner or later,
it's gonna get ruined.

23
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,770
When she turns 30.

24
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,106
When I find out
what her baggage is.

25
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,408
It's there.
I don't know what it is,

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,620
but when I do, party's over.

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,479
Whoa. Ted,
please tell me

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,582
you are not impugning
emotional baggage.

29
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,884
Baggage is a good thing?

30
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:18,019
Emotional baggage
is the bedrock

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,489
of America's most important
cultural export.

32
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,657
Porn.

33
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:25,493
Actually, it's porn.

34
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:28,163
Only women with major baggage

35
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:29,697
go into porn.

36
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,599
Major Baggage.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,800
Ted, everyone has baggage.

38
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,469
You just got to look past it.

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,572
Really? 'Cause the last time
I looked past a girl's baggage,

40
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:40,208
that baggage belonged
to a girl named Stella,

41
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,976
and, oh, I'm drawing
a blank here.

42
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,245
How did that work out again?

43
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:46,814
<i>Here's how it worked out.
Marry me.</i>

44
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,316
<i>I asked her to marry me.
She said yes.</i>

45
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,285
<i>We were happy. But then the day
of the wedding,</i>

46
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:51,819
<i>her karate instructor</i>

47
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,888
<i>ex-boyfriend Tony Grafanello
showed up,</i>

48
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:55,523
<i>declared his love for her,</i>

49
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:57,525
<i>and Stella ran off with him
to California,</i>

50
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:00,328
<i>leaving me utterly and
completely heartbroken.</i>

51
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,462
Ted, look,

52
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:03,231
what happened with
Stella was awful,

53
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:04,465
but that doesn't mean

54
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,301
anyone with baggage
is undateable.

55
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:08,236
Well, I'm just glad
that we met young enough

56
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,504
that I don't have any baggage.

57
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,939
Mother issues.
I do not.

58
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,707
Grandmother issues.
Definitely do not.

59
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,810
Great-grandmother issues.
I just don't like it when she picks me up.

60
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,579
And you know what
your biggest baggage is?

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,880
You're too nice.

62
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,782
How is being nice baggage?

63
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:23,318
Have you ever seen you
walk down the street?

64
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,720
I don't even know
how to answer hat.

65
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:26,988
Well, let me help you out.

66
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,490
Michael!

67
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,126
Javier, Marcello!

68
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,494
Susanne.

69
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:37,732
Hey, Deng, let me
help you with that.

70
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,601
That ought to do it.

71
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:42,303
Oh, guys, no.
I could not today.

72
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,205
It would just be...

73
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,348
That's normal.

74
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,850
There is only one street
where that is normal.

75
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:56,851
Here's a hint:

76
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:59,754
A giant yellow bird
lives on it.

77
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,990
Well, I'll be pretty happy

78
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,125
if Royce's only baggage is
that she's too nice.

79
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:06,694
Too nice?
That is the worst kind of baggage.

80
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:09,030
Best baggage:
Hates her dad

81
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:11,633
and thinks she's
fat, but isn't.

82
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,034
Angry sex on the first date,

83
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,236
and then as soon as
you mention breakfast,

84
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,504
she's gone.

85
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,439
Why do guys hang out with me?

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,375
<i>That night on
my date with Royce,</i>

87
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:23,311
<i>I kept waiting to see
what her baggage would be.</i>

88
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:25,980
So, is spaghetti
your specialty?

89
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:28,950
Uh, no. The main event
is my pancakes.

90
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:31,886
I'll make 'em for you sometime.
They are insane.

91
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:34,422
My dad used to make
multigrain pancakes.

92
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,758
He's the one who got
me working in porn.

93
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:40,995
You know PORN?

94
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,563
"Parents Offering
Recognition and Nutrition"?

95
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:44,599
It's a charity
for inner-city teens

96
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,601
who don't have access to
sports or healthy food.

97
00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:50,772
That reminds me...

98
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,640
I killed my brother...

99
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,878
With this joke
I told him last night.

100
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:01,234
A barber, a stripper
and a Jew...

101
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:08,923
...lliard-trained violinist
walk into a bar.

102
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:11,292
<i>I looked and looked and looked,
but it really appeared</i>

103
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,995
<i>as though there was no baggage
to worry about...</i>

104
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:18,166
<i>until we went
to go see a movie.</i>

105
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,435
♪ ♪

106
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,843
Oh, no.

107
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:30,878
Hey, what took you guys so long?

108
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,480
Nothing.
Forget about it.

109
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,682
We were on our way here,

110
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:35,817
and Marshall wanted

111
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:39,087
to stop and help some guys load
their moving van.

112
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:40,888
To be nice.
It didn't cost nothing.

113
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,924
D when the moving van
drove away,

114
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:45,660
who should show up
but the owner of the apartment

115
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,563
we had just helped
some guys rob.

116
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:52,800
And that one was hard
to explain to the police.

117
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:53,801
See, Marshall?

118
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:55,403
This is what I mean.

119
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:58,539
You can't treat New York City
like it's the small, friendly,

120
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,074
crime-free, inbred, backwoods,

121
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:03,845
Podunk, cow-tipping, Minnesota
Hickville where you grew up.

122
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,346
Crime-free?

123
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,314
Yeah.

124
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,316
Crime-free? In 1994,

125
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:12,220
the cashier from the feed store
was held up at hoepoint.

126
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:13,287
And besides,

127
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:14,856
I like being friendly, okay?

128
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,557
I'm not gonna change that
about myself.

129
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:17,759
No, don't change, baby.

130
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,193
I think it's sweet.

131
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,661
Sweet, sweet.

132
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:22,830
Sweet mother of God,
he's an idiot sometimes.

133
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,733
He actually lent the burglars
gas money.

134
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,835
He gave them money?

135
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,070
Not gave, lent.

136
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,506
They said that they would
send us a check,

137
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:33,908
so Marshall gave them
our address.

138
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,076
What's to stop them

139
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:37,011
from coming
to our apartment one night

140
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,579
and maybe tying me up?

141
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,215
I mean, sure,
Marshall and I like to pretend,

142
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,984
but the reality is scary.

143
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,886
Why don't you say something
to him?

144
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:45,987
What's the point?

145
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,255
<i>He's from Minnesota.</i>

146
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:49,390
His high school mascot
was a hug.

147
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,392
Hey, guys.
Hey!

148
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,227
How'd the date with Royce go?

149
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,463
It was interesting.
We went to see

150
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,532
<i>that new movie
The Wedding Bride.</i>

151
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,766
Oh, how was it?!

152
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,235
Not that I care.
I mean, that's a chick flick.

153
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,703
This one'll probably drag me
to it,

154
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:05,473
like, the 7:10 show
tomorrow night or 9:40 because

155
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:06,474
I have that meeting.

156
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:08,209
But I can probably get o of it,

157
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,510
so let's try for the 7:10.

158
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,179
What's that
movie about, anyway?

159
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,281
That's the interesting part.

160
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,749
Hey, bonehead,

161
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,584
I'm Jed Mosely!

162
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,252
I'm the most powerful

163
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,121
and corrupt architect
in New York.

164
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:21,923
I want...

165
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:26,360
It's about me.

166
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,695
<i>The Wedding Bride is about you?</i>

167
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:33,162
Yeah.

168
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,430
Okay, are you sure
it's about you?

169
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,765
<i>Because when I saw Spaceballs
for the first time,</i>

170
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:36,733
I could have sworn...

171
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,235
<i>This movie is
about me, Marshall.</i>

172
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,604
It was written
by Tony Grafanello.

173
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:44,073
Tony Grafanello?
That's the...

174
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:45,842
Yeah, the guy
that Stella left me for.

175
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:47,010
This movie is the

176
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,211
whole story of our breakup.

177
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:50,380
Why would he write
a movie about that?

178
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:52,248
Isn't he the bad guy
in that story?

179
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:56,019
Yeah, and the good guy is a guy
named Ted Mosby.

180
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,321
Funny, that was my
memory of it, too.

181
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:00,590
But according to the movie...

182
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,726
Mr.
Mosley, your fiancé is here.

183
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,229
Great, the old ball and chain.

184
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,932
I can't wait to make her move
out of her beautiful house

185
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:12,235
in New Jersey and come live with
me in an apartment above a bar.

186
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:13,303
Send her in!

187
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,772
Ah!

188
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,975
Stella, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

189
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:22,445
We're supposed to taste wedding
cakes this afternoon, remember?

190
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:23,579
Ouch!

191
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,784
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

192
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:30,486
Whoa!

193
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:35,959
Aw...

194
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,128
Well, I am stunned.
Right?

195
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,965
That's what passes for comedy
these days?

196
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:44,867
"Whoa, I'm falling back
in my chair!

197
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,369
Whoa!"

198
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,204
Whoa. I'm really falling back
in my chair.

199
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,238
Oh, baby!

200
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,674
Okay, that was pretty funny.

201
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:53,209
What a jerk.

202
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,945
Did he at least get
someone hot to play me?

203
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:56,846
You're not in it.

204
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:57,880
What a jerk!

205
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:58,982
No. No, no, no,

206
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,583
Tony's not a jerk.

207
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:02,785
Not according
to the movie, anyway.

208
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,554
I'm going through
with this wedding.

209
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:06,356
I'm sorry, Tony.

210
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:10,526
Stella, your happiness is
the only thing I care about,

211
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:13,029
except for these underprivileged
children

212
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,164
that I work with for free.

213
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,532
Aw...!

214
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:19,168
I love him.

215
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,070
It's not that easy, Tony.

216
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:24,007
Jed Mosely may not be
as handsome as you are,

217
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,241
as...

218
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:26,509
Tall as you are...

219
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,045
<i>I'm taller than that guy.</i>

220
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:30,747
...and our sex life is terrible.

221
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:31,881
Once, he even fell asleep

222
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:33,583
while we were doing it.
I mean...

223
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:34,717
It was one time.

224
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:36,119
I was on cold medicine!

225
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,721
What?
Nothing.

226
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:41,591
<i>This is a terrible movie!</i>

227
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:43,126
And it got everything wrong!

228
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:45,028
Re-Remember how I proposed
to Stella?

229
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,696
<i>That spontaneous moment
in the arcade;</i>

230
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:47,964
<i>I didn't have a ring,</i>

231
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:50,967
<i>so I gave her a toy I won
from a crane machine?</i>

232
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,368
Oh, that was so sweet.

233
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:53,403
So romantic.

234
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,505
A little cheesy.

235
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:58,041
Well, here's how it went

236
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:02,345
Look, if it'll shut you up,
I guess we can get married.

237
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,680
Aren't you gonna give me a ring?

238
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,784
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

239
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:10,720
Here, put is on your finger.

240
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:11,921
Hey!

241
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:15,258
And remember
the two-minute date?

242
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,360
When I squeezed an entire
romantic evening

243
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:18,561
<i>into just two minutes</i>

244
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:20,029
<i>to accommodate
Stella's busy schedule?</i>

245
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,231
Oh, Ted,
you're such a good guy.

246
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,232
That was really nice.

247
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:26,335
Also a little cheesy.

248
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,904
Well, according to the movie...

249
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,373
What about our big
romantic weekend?

250
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:33,242
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

251
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:35,344
Alls I got time for is
a two-minute date,

252
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:38,614
if you know
what I mean. Sex!

253
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,416
Whoa!

254
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:46,355
Aw...!

255
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,757
Hey, if you know
what you're doing,

256
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:49,025
two minutes is all you need.

257
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,226
Run tell DAT.

258
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:54,263
<i>But the worst,
the worst was the ending.</i>

259
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:56,032
So they're at the wedding...

260
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,668
Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely

261
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,837
to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

262
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:01,838
I...

263
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,439
Whoa-oh! Spoilers!

264
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:05,875
Is what, is what I would say

265
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:09,278
if ever plan on seeing
such an awful film!

266
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,547
Continue.

267
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,818
So they're at the wedding...

268
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,019
I...

269
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,354
Stella!

270
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:19,455
Tony!

271
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:20,490
Tony?!

272
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:22,024
Something I need to say.

273
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:23,092
A long time ago,

274
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:26,062
I let this beautiful girl
named Stella

275
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,563
get away.

276
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:28,631
And now she's with

277
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:31,033
some jerk
who doesn't appreciate

278
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:34,470
what he has in this
beautiful wedding bride.

279
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,572
Aw...!

280
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:40,009
What is wrong with you people?!

281
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,944
You can't talk to me like that!

282
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,579
I'm Ted Mosely!

283
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,282
Did he say "Ted" that time?
Shh!

284
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:48,117
Stella, I promised
to make you my wife.

285
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:52,488
And I'd like to live up
to that promise.

286
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:57,627
Oh, Tony, all I've wanted
all my life was your love.

287
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,329
Oh, go on, honey, kiss him.

288
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,031
Kiss him! Kiss him!

289
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:05,368
Stella, if you still
truly love me...

290
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,602
Kiss him! Kiss him!

291
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:10,973
Will you let me make you
my wedding bride?

292
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:13,042
Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him!

293
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:16,279
Can-do's-ville, baby doll.

294
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,717
No, no, no!

295
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:22,952
Stop doing that!

296
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:24,520
Daddy!

297
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:29,458
Take that, Ted Mosby!

298
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,730
Okay, he definitely
said it that time.

299
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:48,411
Oh, my God!

300
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:49,879
That was so good!

301
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,647
I'm laughing, I'm crying.

302
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:53,716
I... I know
it's all fake,

303
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:56,919
but didn't those seem
like real characters?

304
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,921
It was just so real!

305
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:00,923
Hey, how come
you said, "Oh, no"

306
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:02,425
when the movie started?

307
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,961
<i>That's when I realized
everyone has baggage...</i>

308
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:06,462
<i>including me.</i>

309
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,567
Oh, uh, no reason.

310
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:15,104
Ted, I think you need
to tell Royce the story

311
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:16,772
of what happened
with you and Stella.

312
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,075
It-it's gonna come out
eventually.

313
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:21,010
Why? Why does it
even have to?

314
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:22,745
Well, for starters,

315
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,380
it's now the fifth
highest grossing movie

316
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:25,481
of all time.

317
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,783
I don't care.
I don't care.

318
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:29,752
I'm taking this to the grave.

319
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:31,921
It's a stupid movie anyway!

320
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,256
Sounds terrible.
I would never go

321
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:35,291
see that film because
I support you and I love you.

322
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:37,260
<i>Kids, you know
where this is going.</i>

323
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:41,297
Well, she's made her choice.

324
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,165
Don't worry.

325
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,667
I won't go to the wedding.

326
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:45,935
Oh, you'll go all right!

327
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:49,905
I'm gonna drive you there myself
and make you watch!

328
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:53,142
Billy, no!

329
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:54,944
The code.

330
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,813
This is exactly how it happened.

331
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,815
He got every part right.

332
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,084
Even the thing
with the nunchucks.

333
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,520
<i>So I was resolved
to put The Wedding Bride</i>

334
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,755
<i>as far behind me as possible.</i>

335
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,757
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

336
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:09,558
<i>Oh, how great was
The Wedding Bride?</i>

337
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,394
Oh! Loved it!
Loved it, loved it, loved it!

338
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,663
We're going to see it again tomorrow.
Oh, can we come?

339
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,531
Ted, you want to see it
again, right?

340
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:16,532
Yeah, it was good.

341
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:18,701
"Good"?
Try instant classic!

342
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,870
The only thing wrong
with it--

343
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,471
and I mean, it's such
a minor flaw

344
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:24,106
in an otherwise
flawless film--

345
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,309
is, I just didn't get
why Stella would even want

346
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,944
to marry a guy like Jed Mosely
in the first place.

347
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:32,682
I mean, even that guy's
name: Jed Mosely....

348
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:34,016
Come on, Royce.
You've dated

349
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,751
a few Jed Moselys in your day.

350
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:37,953
Well, okay, but who hasn't?

351
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:41,057
He's such a type;
The butterfly tattoo,

352
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:42,525
the way he pronounces
encyclopedia.

353
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:43,492
Ugh!

354
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:44,960
Encyclo-pay-dia.

355
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,962
Totally, totally.
Well, technically,

356
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:48,631
that is the correct
pronunciation.

357
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:49,632
I was so, so happy

358
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,567
when that loser got left
at the altar.

359
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:54,403
And you know why?
Because he had it coming. Mm-hmm.

360
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:57,106
And the great part is, he is
gonna live a long, sad life,

361
00:13:57,107 --> 00:14:00,242
knowing that he lost
his only chance at happiness.

362
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:02,178
Oh, and what about when he
got beat up by the goat?!

363
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,446
So funny!

364
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,214
What a loser!
Totally.

365
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:06,682
Totally!

366
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:08,718
I mean, the guy's
life was shattered

367
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,753
in a very public humiliation.

368
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:11,800
What a hoot!

369
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:15,000
It may be years before he can look

370
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:16,986
certain family members
in the eye again.

371
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,047
He may be so emotionally traumatized,

372
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:22,256
he never fully loves or trusts
anyone ever again.

373
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,578
It was hysterical!

374
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,265
Move over, Adolf Hitler,

375
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,215
there's a new king
of comedy, right?

376
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,285
Ted, are you okay?

377
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:33,413
No, I just think you all might be interested
to learn something

378
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:37,058
about that movie you all love so much.

379
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,242
It sucks...

380
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,831
And you're all stupid
for liking it.

381
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,724
Wow. That was really mean and

382
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,914
I think you owe us an apology.

383
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,765
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll...

384
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:58,711
No-can-do's-ville...

385
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:06,652
You said, "No-can-do's-
ville, baby doll"?

386
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:09,888
You actually used
Jed Mosely's catchphrase?

387
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,157
I know! I was just
so upset that they...

388
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:15,413
How do you know
that's his catchphrase?

389
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,872
You dragged me into it. I didn't wanna go.
I wanted to see Avatar.

390
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,621
That's it. I'm just gonna move
to some country

391
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,199
<i>where no one's seen
The Wedding Bride.</i>

392
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,600
Good luck, Ted.

393
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:25,269
That movie is worldwide.
It's huge.

394
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:26,571
Maybe North Korea?

395
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,773
Nope. I read
that Kim Jong IL said

396
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,442
it's his second favorite movie
of all time.

397
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,233
Right behind a movie of him
riding a horse in slow motion

398
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:35,883
Sorry, Ted.
You're screwed.

399
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:39,186
No, Ted, you know what, no,
Ted is not screwed.

400
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,005
Do you guys want to know
why I'm nice to everyone?

401
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,449
It's because I don't care bout baggage.

402
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,701
I mean, most people, they see
another person walking down the street

403
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,250
with that big heavy bag
they're carrying,

404
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,361
and they just walk on by.
But not me.

405
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:54,332
I look at them and I say,
I say, "Howdy, stranger.

406
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,568
Can I give you a hand
with that?"

407
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,178
And you know who taught me
to be that way?

408
00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:59,292
A guy called Ted Mosby.

409
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:02,691
A guy who's uncynical and sincere

410
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,196
and believed in things.
And you know what, Ted?

411
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:07,322
I believe that deep down,

412
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:08,896
you're still that guy.

413
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,010
<i>I am still that guy.</i>

414
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,190
I think you want to go out there
and get that girl.

415
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:14,833
I want to get out there and get that girl.

416
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,055
- Because she's the love of your life.
- Because she's...

417
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,065
Oh, well, we're three dates in.
She seems nice.

418
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,463
Because she seems nice!

419
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,517
<i>She does seem nice!</i>

420
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:25,154
You're right, Marshall.

421
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:26,631
I gotta go get her.

422
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,450
And I know exactly where she is.

423
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,441
The wedding's in 15 minutes.

424
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:36,842
I'll never make it!

425
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,659
You can do it, Sensei.

426
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,965
Go get love a house round kick.

427
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:42,431
Right in the heart.

428
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,203
You're right. What am I doing?!

429
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:48,053
There's still time!

430
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,998
Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely

431
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:10,932
To be your lawfully wedded husband,

432
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:13,262
I...

433
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:17,372
- Royce!
- Stella!

434
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:18,729
- Ted?!
- Tony?

435
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,555
- Tony?
- Ted?

436
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,050
Barney?

437
00:17:25,107 --> 00:17:26,419
Look, there's something I need to say.

438
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,257
A long time ago,
A long time ago,

439
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,761
I let this beautiful girl Stella
I let a horrible girl named Stella

440
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,401
Break my heart...
Get away...

441
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,083
And now she's with this jerk

442
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:38,841
who wrote a movie about it
and that movie is called...

443
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,763
<i>The Wedding Bride.</i>

444
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,574
What are you saying?
You can't talk to me like that!

445
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:46,567
I'm Jed Mosely!
I'm Ted Mosely!

446
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:51,122
But Royce, this dufus in the red
cowboy boots, this isn't me.

447
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:53,378
So, just to be clear,
are you saying you that

448
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:55,949
you don't have a pair of red
cowboy boots in your closet?

449
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,561
- Barney what are you...
- I just wanted...

450
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:01,200
They're actually more
of a burgundy.

451
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,383
Royce, I promised
Stella, I promised

452
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,020
to make you some pancakes.
To make you my wife.

453
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,099
And I'd like to
live up to that promise.

454
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:14,221
Ted, all I've wanted all my
life Ted, all I've wanted all week

455
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:17,640
...was your love.
...was some pancakes.

456
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,150
Oh, go on, honey, kiss him!

457
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,183
Kiss him.

458
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,762
Kiss him, kiss him,

459
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,599
Um, Uncle Barney didn't say "kiss".

460
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:28,646
Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him,

461
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:30,066
<i>Still not saying "kiss."</i>

462
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:30,919
Kiss him!

463
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,769
<i>Sir, you need to leave, now.</i>

464
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,272
This is outrageous.
<i>Who the kiss are you?</i>

465
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,523
Royce, if you still...

466
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:38,886
If you still truly love me...

467
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:40,417
...kind of like me...

468
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,192
...can you let me make you

469
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,441
- My wedding bride?
- Can you let me make you some pancakes?

470
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:51,583
Can-do's-ville, babydoll.

471
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,483
Daddy! Kiss this!
Kissin' movie's over anyway.

472
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,613
Sir...
Oh. Oops. Oops.

473
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,236
Hey, um...

474
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,215
...that stuff
that happened to me,

475
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:23,160
it was pretty rough.

476
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,515
I'm, uh, I'm still
getting over it.

477
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,930
Let me help you with that.

478
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,543
And just like that, kids,

479
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:35,239
My baggage didn't seem quite
so heavy anymore.

480
00:19:35,576 --> 00:19:37,569
<i>You see, everyone's
got some baggage--</i>

481
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:40,188
<i>it's part of life--
but like anything else,</i>

482
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:42,451
<i>it's easier when someone
gives you a hand with it.</i>

483
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,350
Wow, it feels so good to have told you
all that stuff about me.

484
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,942
I'm really glad I can open up to you.

485
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,896
Ted, it's not
that big of a deal.

486
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,701
Heck, I've been
left at the altar.

487
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,035
Three times.

488
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:07,327
The last time was because I blew
all our money on online poker.

489
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:11,250
That's why I live
with my brother now.

490
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,107
Wait, I... I thought you said
you had a tiny studio apartment.

491
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:16,748
Just the two of us,

492
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,622
You should see how he hogs the covers.

493
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:25,715
Yeah, you gotta go.
