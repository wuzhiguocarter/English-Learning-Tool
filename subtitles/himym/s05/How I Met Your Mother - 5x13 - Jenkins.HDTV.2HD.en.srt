1
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:07,122
Times square on
new year's eve,

2
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:09,322
Rockefeller center
around christmastime...

3
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:10,775
Yeah! But most of all...

4
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:13,099
A college bar? Oh, man.

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,578
We're probably going to
run into my students.

6
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:17,428
They're going to corner me
and want a free lecture.

7
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:19,182
I don't even have
my slide projector.

8
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:19,814
damn it.

9
00:00:19,814 --> 00:00:22,648
Ted, I've been skee-ball
champ here since law school.

10
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,189
I have to pop in at
least once a month

11
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:25,709
To maintain my record.

12
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:28,053
Whoa. Looks like you've
been gone a while.

13
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:30,341
Some guy named big fudge
has been cleaning up.

14
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:31,796
Yeah, he has.

15
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,673
And you're big fudge.

16
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:34,931
The biggest.

17
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:36,929
Um, so by the way,

18
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:38,785
I-I have to tell you
something. Yeah.

19
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:41,340
I, uh... invited jenkins.

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,106
Jenkins? No way!

21
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:44,679
We'd all started
hearing about jenkins

22
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,978
A few weeks earlier.

23
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,510
You guys will not believe
what jenkins did this time.

24
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,565
Who's jenkins?

25
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:51,793
Oh, he's this hilarious

26
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:53,893
New lawyer at
marshall's office.

27
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:55,885
Hilarious.

28
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,002
Okay, so there's this jar

29
00:00:58,002 --> 00:00:59,896
Of maraschino cherries
in the fridge at work.

30
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,845
So, jenkins says,

31
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:05,309
"200 bucks,
I'll eat the whole jar."

32
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,567
So, we give jenkins
200 bucks...

33
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,749
Jenkins.

34
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:20,781
And after that,
the stories kept coming.

35
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,045
So, the cfo comes in to sign
some acquisition papers.

36
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:25,515
So, jenkins goes,

37
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:27,538
"Excuse me, mr. Wilcox.

38
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:30,447
I think we forgot one
of the documents."

39
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:38,190
Jenkins!

40
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,195
So, we all go out for
beers after work.

41
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:44,096
Jenkins gets up on the
bar and starts gyrating

42
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:46,521
Like some sort of
deranged stripper.

43
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:49,861
Next thing you know,
off comes the shirt!

44
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,026
It was so gross.

45
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,288
All : jenkins.

46
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:55,931
Right?

47
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:58,395
Well, it'll be great to
finally meet the famous
jenkins

48
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:00,300
After all those stories. Yeah.

49
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,412
And there's about to
be one more story.

50
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:04,473
I'm going to bang jenkins.

51
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,255
What? You heard me.

52
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:08,889
You-you want to have
sex with jenkins?

53
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,531
With jenkins, on jenkins,
near jenkins.

54
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,911
You name it. I want to
wear jenkins like a sock.

55
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,511
You... but you're...

56
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,244
Haven't you... i'm...

57
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:20,910
Really? Woman: hey, guys.

58
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:22,863
Ted, this is jenkins.

59
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:25,585
Oh.

60
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,427
Okay, this is going
to sound crazy,

61
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,155
But I thought
jenkins was a guy.

62
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:44,791
What? That's crazy!

63
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,532
What gave you that idea? Oh,
I don't know.

64
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:49,306
Maybe the whole "Jenkins peed
out the window of a cab"
Story.

65
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:50,915
Yeah. Much more
impressive now, isn't it?

66
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:53,766
Yeah. Okay, I'll come clean!

67
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:56,105
It all started a
few weeks ago.

68
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,147
By the way, four eyes,
new lawyer.

69
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,466
This is jenkins.

70
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,385
Watch out for this guy.

71
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:01,785
He steals stuff.

72
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,345
I don't steal stuff.

73
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:06,465
And I don't wear glasses.

74
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,999
I'm marshall. Hi, marshall.

75
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:13,828
So, are you really a vikings
fan or was he lying about
that, too?

76
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:15,613
Why? Is this a trap?

77
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:16,506
Are you a packers fan?

78
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:17,663
My wife knows I'm here.

79
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,705
She doesn't have money,
but what she does have

80
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,709
Is a very special
set of skills.

81
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,414
I'm a vikings fan, too!

82
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:24,631
I bleed purple and gold.

83
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,314
I'm from pelican rapids.

84
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:27,531
Pelican rapids?

85
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,677
No way. Yeah.

86
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:30,715
My grandpa lives
in pelican rapids.

87
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:31,741
Well, I mean, he's dead now,

88
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:33,925
But he haunts a
barn off route 108.

89
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:35,295
whoa!

90
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,704
Hold it, hold it. Dude,

91
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:37,637
If you tell me
you have a thing

92
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:39,124
For a woman that
is not your wife,

93
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,677
I will drag you outside
and kick your ass.

94
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:44,860
Okay, first of all...
come on, buddy.

95
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,612
You can't handle the fudge.

96
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:48,132
Second of all, no.

97
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,886
I think of her like a...
A big brother.

98
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,709
Who, I guess, has boobs.

99
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,226
But so does my oldest brother,
marvin jr. Anyway,

100
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:57,065
That night,
I told lily about it.

101
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:58,415
Jenkins.

102
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:01,148
Aw. I can't wait to meet him.

103
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,764
I should have corrected her.

104
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,856
It would have been so easy.

105
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,726
But I didn't, so,

106
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:09,085
After that, whenever I
talked about jenkins,

107
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,647
I always avoided pronouns.

108
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:12,987
So, the head of
marketing comes in

109
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,251
To choose people for
the midwest audit.

110
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,268
So, he goes, "Him, him, her,

111
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:20,371
"Him, him...

112
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:22,507
Jenkins, him, her."

113
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,738
Look, I don't understand why
you wouldn't just tell lily.

114
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,428
Do you really think she'd
be all that jealous?

115
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,921
Ted, think about those
stories I told you.

116
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,514
Yeah, I could see how
that'd be a problem.

117
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:49,191
Exactly. That's why
lily can't find out.

118
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:50,573
Lily can't find out what?

119
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,182
That marshall's going
to buy her a horse.

120
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,559
You are?

121
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,901
That is so awesome!

122
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,093
I love those things.

123
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:00,227
Hey, guys, why...

124
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,575
Why is that kid over
there staring at me?

125
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,179
I think I know what this is.

126
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,945
I think it has
finally happened.

127
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm getting
recognized fromy show.

128
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,937
Oh, robin, that is so cute.

129
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:15,781
But that's scotty.

130
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:18,121
He's one of my students,
and he's looking at me. Oh.

131
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:20,543
How weird is it that I'm
more famous than you?

132
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:23,729
I'm on tv.

133
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,428
Yeah, and I have 30
students in my class.

134
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,956
That's what,
30 times your viewership?

135
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,771
Now, this will give
scotty a little thrill--

136
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,955
Buying a drink
for the old prof.

137
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:34,858
All right, scotter,
one question

138
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:37,184
About neoclassical
architecture, and that is it.

139
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:38,662
You're robin
scherbatsky, right?

140
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:41,115
What? Yes, I am.

141
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:43,443
Wow. Look,
I-I didn't mean to stare.

142
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,670
It's just, I watch
your show all the time.

143
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,540
Really?

144
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,348
Really?

145
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,712
Totally.

146
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,373
What are you doing
out with ted?

147
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:55,495
Uh, it's professor mosby.

148
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:56,731
We're friends.

149
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,434
Holy crap!

150
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,132
Robin scherbatsky is friends
with my econ professor.

151
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:02,136
It's architecture!

152
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:03,076
All right,
you know what, scotty?

153
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:05,065
You're crowding us.
Hit the bricks.

154
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:07,718
Wait a minute.
You're big fudge.

155
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:09,225
Go!

156
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,391
Hello?

157
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:14,303
Hey, baby, I'm on my way up.

158
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:15,635
What? Why?

159
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:17,500
There was a measles
outbreak at school,

160
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,950
And they called a half day.

161
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,164
Thought I'd come by here,
have lunch,

162
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,054
Maybe give you the measles.

163
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,490
Okay.

164
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:27,144
Um, I have a problem.

165
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,592
That was my wife.

166
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:29,705
When I first mentioned you,

167
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,741
She mistakenly thought
you were a guy, and so...

168
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,201
So, now you're worried
that when she finds out

169
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,430
I'm a woman, she's going
to totally flip out.

170
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,038
Yes. E-exactly.

171
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:38,531
Oh, geez. Oh, gosh. Okay.

172
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,832
Okay, I was in an improv group

173
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,522
In pelican rapids.
Follow my lead. Okay.

174
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,731
Hey! Hey, baby.

175
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,797
Mmm. Oh, oh, hi.

176
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,389
I'm lily, marshall's wife.

177
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,660
I am from the french embassy.

178
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,321
I am here because of a
small but significant

179
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,095
Cheese incident
that occurred...

180
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,631
She's jenkins!

181
00:07:02,342 --> 00:07:04,216
You're jenkins?

182
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,902
Yeah, well, that, uh,
camembert crisis

183
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:08,208
Isn't going to resolve itself,

184
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,350
So I'll catch you
guys on the flip-flop.

185
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,701
Marshall cringed.

186
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,402
This was the moment
he had feared.

187
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,001
The famous jenkins!

188
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,328
How about that?

189
00:07:16,328 --> 00:07:18,126
Funny, I was picturing a guy.

190
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,741
Anywho, lunch?

191
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,602
Wait. W-w-w-w-wait.

192
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,682
So... so, you're
not jealous at all?

193
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:28,494
I never have to worry about
you with another woman.

194
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,492
Right, because we're so
hopelessly in love, right?

195
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,962
Yeah, sure.

196
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:34,740
Anywho, lunch?

197
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,292
She wasn't jealous at all.

198
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,733
Of course, she wasn't jealous.

199
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,073
That's the whole dynamic
of your relationship.

200
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,468
What's that supposed to mean?

201
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,123
Uh, it's like this, my man.

202
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:47,461
Every good relationship has
a reacher and a settler.

203
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:49,540
Exactly. One person reaches

204
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,808
For someone out
of their league;

205
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:53,864
The other one settles for
someone below theirs.

206
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:56,287
I did not settle for lily.

207
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:58,279
Okay, yes,
she's a little short,

208
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,455
And-- true- my mom
says she doesn't have

209
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:03,173
The hips to birth an
eriksen child, but...

210
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:05,837
Oh, my god, you guys
think I'm the reacher.

211
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:07,490
That's why lily's not jealous.

212
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,568
The settler is never jealous
of the reacher because,

213
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,448
Where is the reacher
going to go?

214
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,527
The settler, lily,
is the best thing

215
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,437
That the reacher, marshall,
is ever going to get.

216
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,918
No. No... okay.

217
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,328
Yes, I am lucky to have lily,

218
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:23,490
But lily is just as lucky...
to have me.

219
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,699
Okay. Neither one of
us is the reacher.

220
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,510
Dude, you are so the reacher.

221
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,844
You're getting her a horse!

222
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:34,222
What? Shh. Take the hit.

223
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,564
Take the hit.

224
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,040
Thus ending modern
architecture's

225
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,444
Very brief experiment with the
v-frame house.

226
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:47,748
Excuse me a second.

227
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,330
What are you doing here?

228
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,730
I noticed you forgot
something this morning,

229
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,223
So I thought I'd bring it by.

230
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,379
Your pen. This is your pen.

231
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,886
And you chewed on the
end of it. Recently.

232
00:08:57,886 --> 00:08:59,383
Ah, not a problem, ted.

233
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,370
Your class was on my way
to work. No, it's not.

234
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,514
At come on, get up new york!,

235
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:04,994
Where I'm an anchor, so...

236
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,659
I watch your show
all the time.

237
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:09,483
What?!

238
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,934
You watch the show? Oh!

239
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,353
Well, paint me flattered.
Any other fans out there?

240
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,210
Oh, we got... oh.

241
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,224
Okay, all right.
Thanks for coming by, robin.

242
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,204
Oh, well, tune in tonight.

243
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:21,374
I am doing a great
piece on snail poison.

244
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:23,528
Also,

245
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,285
Who's got the worst
pizza in new york?

246
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:26,492
I'll give you the
answer after traffic

247
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,838
On the ones, threes,
fives and nines.

248
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,846
Really?

249
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:33,407
You guys watch her show?

250
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,295
It's like watching a wel
l-lit aquarium,

251
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,725
But not as interesting.

252
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:38,910
And now that I think about it,
not as well lit.

253
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,330
Well, the truth is,

254
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,968
We watch it for
the drinking game.

255
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:44,207
The who now?

256
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,198
Her morning show
comes on so early,

257
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,013
We're usually
still at the bar,

258
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,925
So whenever she
does an interview,

259
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:53,120
You have to drink every
time she says, "But, um..""

260
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,410
"But, um..."?

261
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,514
"But, um..."

262
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,958
Apparently, she says it a lot.

263
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,841
It's funny.

264
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,937
I had a drinking
game based on robin,

265
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,694
But it was actually on robin.

266
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,353
I'd pour peach schnapps
in her belly button...

267
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:06,608
Dude, we agreed we
wouldn't do this.

268
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,013
Sorry. You're right.

269
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,762
She didn't like it anyway.

270
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,178
Said it woke her up.

271
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,298
Does she really say "But,
um.."" That much?

272
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:18,408
That night, we found out
just how much she said it.

273
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,908
Robin : oh, that's great.

274
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:21,215
But, um... ted: but,
um... barney: nice.

275
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,404
This wasn't your first

276
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:23,588
Spelling bee, was it?

277
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:24,708
Nope. Third.

278
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,578
Oh, good for you.

279
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,577
But, um...

280
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:30,171
But, um...

281
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:36,058
But, um... but, um...

282
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:46,646
Hmm.

283
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,382
Interesting article
in the paper.

284
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,926
Says that in every
relationship, there's a
reacher and a settler.

285
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,312
Really? Let me see it.

286
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,381
No, uh, it's not
in this newspaper.

287
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:57,812
It's in one I
read a while back.

288
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:00,500
This newspaper reminded
me of the other newspaper.

289
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,783
Anywho...

290
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,374
What do you think about that?

291
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:07,310
Well, I guess sometimes
that's the case.

292
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,359
But not in ours.

293
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:11,278
What? No, of course not.

294
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,043
Right.

295
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:17,997
Well, say-- gun to your head--

296
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:21,633
You had to say one of
us was the reacher.

297
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,642
Well, I'd say it's neither.

298
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,417
That's what makes us great.

299
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:29,502
Okay, now there's
a gun to my head

300
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:32,510
And our future children,
and our future cat or monkey,

301
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:33,820
Depending on who
wins the game of risk

302
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,435
We've been playing
for three years.

303
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:36,768
Nope.

304
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:38,742
No reacher, no settler.

305
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:41,054
Mmm. Mmm.

306
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,146
Well, how about this?

307
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,753
This went on for a while.

308
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,524
Until finally...

309
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,478
Our two kids,

310
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:53,322
Our eight grandkids,
our 11 great-grandkids

311
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:57,311
Are all on a plane
piloted by oprah

312
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,074
And it's about to crash
into an art museum

313
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:01,630
With all of your
favorite paintings,

314
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,422
And the only way... the
only way to save everything

315
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,506
Is just... is just to
answer the question:

316
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:09,620
Are you the reacher
or the settler?

317
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,405
And oprah's tried everything?

318
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:13,558
Everything!

319
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:16,074
You have to decide now.

320
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:20,323
Well, I guess,
if I had to say,

321
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,474
Then maybe I'd say

322
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:23,162
I'm the settler.

323
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:25,263
How could you say that?!

324
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,979
She thinks that
she's the settler.

325
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:29,622
I mean, that's it.

326
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,862
I gotta-I gotta prove to her
that I am not the reacher.

327
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:34,335
I gotta make her jealous.

328
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:35,705
Well, that's easy.
Here's the plan.

329
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:38,017
*Sleep with jenkins.

330
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:40,252
*I sleep with jenkins first.

331
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,291
*We do step two first.

332
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,196
I'm gonna go get
started on step two.

333
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,934
Okay, okay, I got something.

334
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,754
Remember the other night,
the skee-ball game?

335
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,656
When you were putting nothing
but wood in the 50 hole?

336
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:52,336
Whatever.

337
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,525
Just another night
for big fudge.

338
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,200
You thought she was into me?

339
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,535
Full-on lady wood.

340
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,103
Yes.

341
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:25,306
Of course.

342
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,308
A plan taketh shape.

343
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,893
If lady lily's jealousy

344
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,248
Young marshall cannot budge,

345
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:37,619
Then perchance,
fair gentles, big fudge...

346
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,221
Can...

347
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:40,227
Make her jealous.

348
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:41,522
Okay, let me try that again.

349
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,246
If lady lily's...
I got it, buddy.

350
00:13:43,246 --> 00:13:44,870
I got it.

351
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:50,084
Ted, I have got a great idea.

352
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:51,133
Oh, is it "clean your hair

353
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,817
"out of the shower drain
when you're done"?

354
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:55,427
Seriously, it's like you're
trying to carpet the tub.

355
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:58,801
If you wanted to print out
one of your lectures or
something,

356
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:00,628
I could read it on air.

357
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:03,581
Coming from a more
entertaining source,

358
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:06,630
Your students might actually
pay attention and learn
something.

359
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,834
Oh, you're entertaining?

360
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,751
Last night, there was
three minutes of dead air

361
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:13,211
While you sewed a button
back on your sweater.

362
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,198
Look, just because your class
likes me more than you...

363
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:18,772
You're a drinking game! What?

364
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:19,886
That's why they watch.

365
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:21,109
They made a drinking
game out of you.

366
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:24,429
Every time you say "But,
um..."" They do a shot.

367
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,456
"But, um..."? Yeah.

368
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,110
I don't say, "But, um..."

369
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,835
I've never said, "But, um..."

370
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,951
Well, then, I guess it's not
a very good drinking game.

371
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,934
Which would mean last night,
when barney and I played it,

372
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:37,411
I didn't get super wasted and
throw up all over myself.

373
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,736
Oh, wait, I did both
of those things.

374
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:43,485
So, face.

375
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,635
Hey, jenkins. Hey, buddy.

376
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,746
Hey, so, um,

377
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:52,811
Lily and I are gonna go back
to that college bar again.

378
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:55,140
And, uh, we were wondering
if maybe you wanted to come.

379
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,601
Uh, you could just, like,
watch me play skee-ball

380
00:14:57,601 --> 00:14:59,763
Or do exactly what you
did the other night.

381
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:00,842
Something like that.

382
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:03,418
It's really up to you.
I mean, I know that...

383
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,941
Hey, baby,
what are you doing home?

384
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,092
"Baby."

385
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:26,970
That's... that's a
name I don't deserve.

386
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,151
What?

387
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:30,090
Jenkins kissed me.

388
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,547
She kissed me.

389
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:34,434
The other day,
she saw me play skee-ball,

390
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,505
And I don't know, I guess

391
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:37,941
She caught some of
the big fudge fever.

392
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,003
But you have to know

393
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:40,896
I stopped it right away.

394
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:44,357
And just, you're the
only one for me, baby.

395
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,107
Oh, I see what this is.

396
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:51,409
This is about the whole
reacher/settler thing.

397
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,996
Come again for big fudge?

398
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,466
You want to make me jealous,

399
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,949
So you're making up a
story about jenkins.

400
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:59,165
I'm not making this up!

401
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:00,097
This happened.

402
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,591
That woman kissed
me with tongue.

403
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,610
Her-her tongue
was in my mouth.

404
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,458
Sure it was.

405
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,638
It was thick and rough
like a starfish arm.

406
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:12,042
Oh, I'm so jealous.

407
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,810
I'm just gonna go over there
and punch her right in the
nose.

408
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,455
Give her a knuckle sandwich.

409
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,274
Come on, baby.
You want some soup?

410
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:23,638
It happened!

411
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:26,407
Do you have any...

412
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:28,595
Split pea left?

413
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,738
These are just a few of
the many contributions

414
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:33,968
He made to
architecture and yet

415
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:36,464
He is only remembered
for one thing.

416
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:39,209
That my friends,
is the sad legacy

417
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,269
Of gregorio franchetti gazebo.

418
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,752
Any questions?

419
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:47,792
Hey, do you want to go out
drinking with us tonight?

420
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:48,492
What?

421
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:49,403
Yeah, we're gonna play

422
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:51,390
The robin scherbatsky
drinking game.

423
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,468
We were wondering if
you wanted to join us.

424
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:59,002
Well, what can I say except "
But, ums up."

425
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,553
Can I still come?

426
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,184
I'll pay. Nice.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

427
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:06,552
Okay.

428
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:10,521
So, your third book was your
breakout novel but, um...

429
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:12,381
But, um...!

430
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,277
Damn!

431
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:15,708
Sorry.

432
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,705
But-- just "But" No "Um,
" Just "But."

433
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,005
Your first novel was
written more quickly.

434
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:24,006
That's correct.

435
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,473
But, um... all: but, um...!

436
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,533
How great is this?!

437
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,525
And it was right then
that robin got an idea

438
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,846
That would end the
drinking game forever.

439
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,481
I wanted to ask you about

440
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,532
The novel you're
writing right now.

441
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,179
But, um... all: but, um...!

442
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,809
...it's an idea you've
had for a, but, um...

443
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:44,866
But, um...!

444
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:45,553
...long time, but, um...?

445
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:47,328
But, um...!

446
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:48,979
No... no, no, no.

447
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,744
Don't drink, it's a trap!

448
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:51,963
I think I'm gonna go.

449
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:53,457
You can keep your ten bucks.

450
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:56,175
Okay, but, um,
thanks for being with us.

451
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,616
But, um, if there's any
college kids watching,

452
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:01,610
But, um, but, um, but,
um, but, um, but, um,

453
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,656
We have to drink, professor.

454
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:07,507
It's the rules.
She said "But, um"

455
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,515
But, um, but, um, but,
um... god help us all.

456
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:15,773
Here you are.

457
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:18,595
I'm so sorry I
kissed you yesterday.

458
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,428
That's okay.

459
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:22,220
And I'm sorry I had sex
with you in the mailroom.

460
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,257
That wasn't me.

461
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:24,365
Oh, good grief, that's two

462
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:26,779
Awkward conversations
I have to have today.

463
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,670
I don't normally do that.

464
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,519
I-I was really drunk.

465
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,217
You were drunk at 8:
00 in the morning?

466
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,117
Yeah, I don't know
how that happened.

467
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:36,668
Robin : I thought snail
pellets were safe, but, um...

468
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,477
But, um...!

469
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,742
I gotta get to work.

470
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,525
Man, that game is
really catching on.

471
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:50,202
Damn it, how could I do this?

472
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:51,264
It's okay.

473
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,067
No, you know what,
it's not okay.

474
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,103
You're the nicest guy
in this stupid office

475
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,729
And I really don't want to
screw up our friendship.

476
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,113
This is so embarrassing.

477
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,884
Please don't tell anyone.

478
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,703
No, who am I gonna tell?

479
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:04,007
Lily?

480
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:05,405
I told lily.

481
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,434
Oh, for pete's sake, well,
I gotta go talk to her.

482
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,498
I gotta apologize.

483
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:10,092
No! No! Don't... yes.

484
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:12,617
Marshall, I'm just gonna
tell her that it happened,

485
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,524
That it meant nothing
and that I'm sorry.

486
00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:16,170
No, I...

487
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,393
Yes.

488
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:22,569
Yes. Do that.

489
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,287
I will.

490
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,069
Yeah, and if you don't
have time for all that,

491
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:28,209
Just tell her it happened,
and that you're sorry.

492
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,092
And if you're in a real rush,

493
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,343
you don't even have to say,
"I'm sorry""

494
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:31,817
Just tell her
that it happened.

495
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,575
That's the important part,
that it actually happened.

496
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,914
So emphasize that
as much as you can.

497
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:39,366
And so, lily, I guess

498
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:41,655
What I'm saying is,
it happened.

499
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:45,027
I feel terrible about it,
and I'm really sorry.

500
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:48,252
Well... it happened.

501
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,909
What are you going to do?

502
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:51,143
It happened.

503
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:54,447
Terrible! But like I said...

504
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:55,403
It happened.

505
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,770
Exactly, and I feel
awful about it.

506
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,836
And I'd hate myself
if what I did

507
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:02,448
Hurt you in any way or
affected your relationship
with marshall.

508
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:03,727
Please forgive me.

509
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,158
Kiss my husband?!

510
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:08,077
My husband?! Nobody kisses

511
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:10,370
My future baby daddy but me!

512
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,041
Marshall, you're
blocking the shot!

513
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,210
Well, I...

514
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,698
And, kids, your uncle marshall

515
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:19,015
Never tried to make
lily jealous again.

516
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,639
That's good.

517
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:31,456
Okay, we're just going to
have a nice, low-key class
today.

518
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,184
Not a lot of talking.

519
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,648
No loud noises.

520
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:40,527
'sup guys?

521
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,566
No, no, no, no.
Please, just... just go away.

522
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:46,648
I just wanted to
drop by and say...

523
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:49,722
Thanks for watching

524
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:52,114
Come on, get up new york!

525
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:54,415
Whoo!

526
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,346
But, um...!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
