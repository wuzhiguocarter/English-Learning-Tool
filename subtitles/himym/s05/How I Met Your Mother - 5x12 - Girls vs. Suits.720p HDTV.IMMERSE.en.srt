1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:04,545
<i>Kids, you never know when you're about
to meet someone really important.</i>

2
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:06,881
<i>It's not like life gives you
a warning.</i>

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,774
<i>You just look up and there they are.</i>

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,762
Come on, we're going to
go get trashed on the roof.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>No, not that dude.</i>

6
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,002
<i>Her.</i>

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,159
I'm good, Boomer.

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,853
My name's not Boomer.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,421
In my head, it is.

10
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:26,054
Gentlemen, I'm a faculty member,
and you're underage,

11
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,379
so it's my duty to confiscate this

12
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,292
and this and...

13
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:31,948
hard lemonade?

14
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,325
You know what?
You can keep that.

15
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:38,871
I swear, every week I get asked
by some frat guy to a kegger, and I say,

16
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:41,891
"I'm a PhD candidate writing
a dissertation entitled

17
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:44,312
'Foreign Direct Investment
and Intergenerational Linkages

18
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:46,075
in Consumption Behavior.'"

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,880
And what does Frat Guy say to that?

20
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:49,340
"That's hot."

21
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,551
Actually, that is kind of hot.

22
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,179
Ted, I have a confession.

23
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,181
I recognize you.

24
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,077
Do you rember the first day
of classes last semester?

25
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:01,553
Econ 305?

26
00:01:02,598 --> 00:01:05,022
<i>Kids, you remember
the wrong classroom story.</i>

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,776
<i>I thought I was in Architecture 101,
but it was Econ 305.</i>

28
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,946
<i>Of course, what I didn't know was</i>

29
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,030
<i>that your mother was
somewhere in that class,</i>

30
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,541
<i>and she thought
I was a complete idiot.</i>

31
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,012
I thought you were a complete idiot.

32
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,137
But a very cute idiot.

33
00:01:22,848 --> 00:01:23,766
So...

34
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:26,377
do you ever date cute idiots?

35
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,087
Almost exclusively.

36
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,201
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,351
.:: La Fabrique ::.

38
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,020
She's a PhD candidate,

39
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,867
she reads philosophy for fun,

40
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:49,859
she does the Sunday crossword
every week and finishes it.

41
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,821
Ted, I am so happy for you...
Sorry,

42
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,089
not for you, happy I'm not you.

43
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:59,410
Long story short:
I have a date tonight.

44
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,542
Thanks, New York,
I'll try not to screw it up.

45
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,195
What's going on?
There's a huge line outside MacLaren's.

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,758
And why is it almost entirely dudes?

47
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:17,303
Only two things could cause
that kind of commotion.

48
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:18,512
Boobs.

49
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:21,161
<i>She's my cherry pie...</i>

50
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,975
Ladies and gentlemen,

51
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,936
MacLaren's has hired
a hot bartender.

52
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,106
<i>Sweet cherry pie, yeah.</i>

53
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,869
Look at all these guys.

54
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,655
The sidewalk's going to smell
like pee-pee now.

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,995
Well, we'd better start
looking for a new bar.

56
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:40,868
What, are you crazy?

57
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,411
It is a hot bartender.

58
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:47,111
Do you know how long
I have been waiting to land a...

59
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,628
My friends, I have been
with many women in my day.

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,878
Lawyers, teachers, poets, doctors,

61
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,759
professional equestrians,
amateur equestrians...

62
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:03,307
A butcher, a baker,
a candlestick maker...

63
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:05,899
Yes, we're
to the rhyming section now...

64
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:09,929
a math professor, a tax assessor,
a weight guesser...

65
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,849
A puppeteer, a blackjack dealer,

66
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,724
a stay-at-home mom...
that's a job, too, guys...

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,614
- a circuit court judge...
- Get to the point!

68
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,006
I have never, ever

69
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,739
scored a hot bartender

70
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,703
until tonight.

71
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:27,498
She's really not that hot.

72
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,941
Is someone jealous
of all the attention?

73
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,736
Did somebody fancy herself
the hottest girl in the bar?

74
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:36,654
Gosh, no. Shut up!

75
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,592
- Wish me luck.
- It's never going to happen.

76
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:42,779
Barney, she's just going
to pretend to like you

77
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:45,182
the same way she hypnotized
all these geniuses.

78
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,476
But guess who's not going
to fall under her spell?

79
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,472
I'm gonna be all,
"Drop the act, baby doll.

80
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,120
Daddy needs a gin and tonic."

81
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,400
Then when she brings it, I'm gonna just
spit it out and say, "Try again."

82
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,547
Boom! Alpha dog is
right where he belongs:

83
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:00,477
on top, then after a few minutes,
on the bottom.

84
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:02,452
Why should I do all the work?

85
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:05,411
What's happening?

86
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,674
New superhot bartender.

87
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,712
See? Marshall doesn't think
she's hot either.

88
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,838
He does.

89
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,534
Baby, you don't have to pretend

90
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:20,163
other women aren't attractive
just for my sake.

91
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:23,847
I know, and if that woman
were anywhere near as hot

92
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,888
as the woman I'm married
to, then I'd admit it, but she's not.

93
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,177
Baby, you're so sweet,
but compared to that woman,

94
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,438
I am a big bag
three days old garbage.

95
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,667
Well, I call 'em like
I see 'em, and...

96
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:39,105
I just think you're the most
beautiful woman in the world.

97
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,329
See, that's just annoying.

98
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,742
Oh, my God, you are so funny.

99
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,662
- That'll be $6.75.
- Here's a 50, keep the change.

100
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:50,247
Thank you.

101
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:51,863
Amateurs.

102
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,926
- What do you want?
- Drop the act, baby doll...

103
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,051
wait, what?

104
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:00,615
Are you gonna order a drink or are you
just gonna stand there looking stupid?

105
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,694
I don't know how to make an um.
Is that equal parts vodka

106
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,663
and get-the-hell-out-of-my-face?

107
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:09,002
Bobbie, what's going on?

108
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,395
Later that night, I embarked
upon a very important first date.

109
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,757
- How are you?
- Good.

110
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,035
<i>It's funny,
sometimes you walk into a place</i>

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,277
<i>you've never been before,
but you get the feeling</i>

112
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,715
<i>you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.</i>

113
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,771
<i>And kids, that's the first time I ever
saw your mother's little yellow bus.</i>

114
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,037
<i>You know the one.</i>

115
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,929
<i>It's right behind you.</i>

116
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:37,397
This is cute.

117
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:39,922
Actually, it's my roommate's.

118
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:46,887
<i>So, there I was, kids, standing
in your mother's apartment,</i>

119
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:50,057
<i>Never mind the fact that I was
on a date with her roommate Cindy.</i>

120
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,016
Sorry,

121
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:53,686
I shouldn't be messing
with your roommate's stuff.

122
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,842
What's she like?

123
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,869
<i>I didn't know it,
but I was about to hear</i>

124
00:05:57,994 --> 00:06:01,026
<i>the very first description
of the woman I'd one day marry.</i>

125
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,523
She's a whore.

126
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:05,739
I think she's a dominatrix.
What?

127
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:09,076
Okay, I'm sorry,
none of that is true.

128
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:12,496
- I have a bit of a roommate complex.
- Why?

129
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:15,332
Guys are always falling
in love with her.

130
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,501
Look at me.

131
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,327
I promise you

132
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,407
I am not going to fall
in love with your roommate.

133
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:23,532
<i>Oops.</i>

134
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,788
Okay, now that you've had
a closer look, admit it:

135
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:30,681
That bartender is
the hottest woman in this bar.

136
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,099
Second hottest.

137
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,698
I repeat...

138
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,274
Baby, how could you
not want to hit that?

139
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,651
Iwant to hit that.

140
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,832
If you don't want to hit that,
I'm sorry, but you might be gay.

141
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:45,932
Hell, yeah, I'm gay.

142
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,259
Gay for you.

143
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,547
Whatever.
Did you find out why

144
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,953
I'm the one guy in this
entire bar she seems to despise?

145
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,871
I did...

146
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,582
You're not going to like the answer.

147
00:06:57,058 --> 00:07:01,045
My last three boyfriends were
Wall Street guys... bastards,

148
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,565
so I vowed never again to date
a guy who wears suits.

149
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:08,413
Okay, well, that's easy.

150
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,220
All I have to do is
stop wearing suits.

151
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,574
That's all?

152
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,807
Come on, you're never not in a suit.

153
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,436
True...

154
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:21,899
but for those... I mean, for that...
I mean, for her...

155
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,756
I will stop wearing...

156
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:29,629
- wait for it...
- We know you're going to say "suits."

157
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,241
... suits.

158
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,081
<i>Meanwhile, Cindy and I
were having a lovely evening,</i>

159
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,456
<i>except she wasn't kidding
about her roommate complex.</i>

160
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,667
And another weird thing
about my roommate:

161
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,920
She does these bizarre paintings
of robots playing sports.

162
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,664
That is weird.

163
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:47,903
<i>I was lying.
That sounded awesome.</i>

164
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:49,866
<i>Your mother's
Robot Volleyball watercolor</i>

165
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,054
<i>is hanging up
in the den as we speak.</i>

166
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,094
And she has this crazy habit

167
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:56,475
of making breakfast food
sing show tunes.

168
00:07:56,857 --> 00:07:58,209
That's just bizarre.

169
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,125
<i>Your mother's rendition
of "Memories"</i>

170
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,537
<i>as performed by an
English muffin is, to this day,</i>

171
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:05,225
<i>the most hauntingly beautiful
thing I've ever heard.</i>

172
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,937
Look, I'm sold.

173
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,863
I hate this girl.

174
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:14,201
Look, she's not that bad.
I just get a little jealous.

176
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,933
I don't know why.

177
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,246
You're awesome.

178
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,112
<i>But not as awesome as your mother.</i>

179
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,525
<i>And speaking of things
that are less awesome,</i>

180
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,170
<i>your Uncle Barney
had officially suited down.</i>

181
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,298
I am so sorry, I misjudged you.

182
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,650
If there is one type of person
that I cannot stand,

183
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,178
it is a man in a suits.

184
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:36,878
That and a woman
who has no respect for herself.

185
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,724
Suits and insecure women.
I hate 'em.

186
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,898
Just hate 'em.

187
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,706
How was your date with Cindy?

188
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:52,781
Well, last night was
great, today not so much.

189
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,032
What, why?

190
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,441
I found out the school's policy

191
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:59,511
about students and professors
dating is really strict.

192
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,165
I could lose my scholarship.

193
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:03,882
Yeah, but it's not
like you're in my class.

194
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,794
We're not even
in the same department.

195
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:08,297
I'm sorry, but I just can't risk it.

196
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,943
She's completely
overreacting, right?

197
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,019
Actually, Ted, she has a point.

198
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:16,477
Yeah, and think about it.
If the rules are that strict,

199
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,115
you could be putting
your job in jeopardy.

200
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,894
I think, I think you got
to let this one go, buddy.

201
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,384
Let's try this again:
she's completely overreacting, right?

202
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,446
<i>Of course, they were right.
I had to let it go,</i>

203
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,209
<i>but as your Uncle Barney
was about to find out,</i>

204
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,855
<i>it's not so easy to let things go.</i>

205
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,970
<i>Suit up.</i>

206
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:51,495
<i>Now, none of us had ever seen Barney
go this long without suiting up,</i>

207
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,470
<i>and kids, it wasn't pretty.</i>

208
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:56,802
So sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.

209
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,674
You know, today I had that presentation
on offshore dividend tax implications?

210
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,061
Sure, I was totally paying attention
when you talked about that.

211
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:06,607
Right,
so I fire up the PowerPoint...

212
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,091
<i>Suit up.</i>

213
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,276
We're going to order some food.

214
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:54,610
Okay, be out in a sec.

215
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,663
Out of the way!

216
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:07,084
Stay with me.
It's not your time.

217
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:11,257
<i>If anyone could fix something like this,
it was Barney's personal tailor,</i>

218
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:13,014
<i>TV's Tim Gunn.</i>

219
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,948
I'm sorry, Barney.

220
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:16,773
I couldn't make it work.

221
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,258
So young.

222
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,599
There's nothing else you could do?

223
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:28,478
But there is another suit
that can use the buttons from your suit.

224
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,863
That can...

225
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,759
Like an organ donor?

226
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:35,035
Your suit's death
could mean another suit's life.

227
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,599
But I...

228
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,325
Do it.

229
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,294
You're doing the right thing.

230
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,914
Please don't cry on this.

231
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,709
- It's silk.
- I'm sorry.

232
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:52,272
I know.

233
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,753
We cremated the remains.

234
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:03,149
His buttons saved the life

235
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:05,473
of a sick little jacket
on the Upper East Side.

236
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:09,772
Well, at least now
you can finally drop this quest

237
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,771
for the so-called Hot Bartender.

238
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,903
My suit gave its life
for this cause,

239
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,866
and I will not rest until those...

240
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,957
I mean, that...
I mean,

241
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:24,741
is mine.

242
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,040
He's absolutely right.

243
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,669
Who, the guy kissing a jar
full of dead suit ashes, that guy?

244
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,843
What if Cindy is the woman I'm supposed
to marry, and I'm just giving up?

245
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,384
So long, elegant,
yet welcoming home in Westchester

246
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,551
with a sensible mortgage I can handle
without dipping into my savings.

247
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:47,505
Bye-bye, two kids I raised with a stern,
yet loving hand,

248
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,280
finding the perfect balance
between father and friend.

249
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:53,646
Adios, triplet schnauzers,
Frank, Lloyd and Wright.

250
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,965
The point is,

251
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:57,942
I'm not giving up, either!

252
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,656
I don't know why I just did that.

253
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:08,661
Barney,
I'm so sorry about your friend.

254
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,968
Tell me about him.

255
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:12,739
He was Italian.

256
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,296
Classy, elegant.

257
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:18,177
And boy,
did he have a way with the ladies.

258
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,803
They just couldn't say no.

259
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,674
- How old was he?
- Seven.

260
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,710
I miss him so much!

261
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:27,889
You shouldn't be alone tonight.

262
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,161
I'm gonna end my shift early.

263
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,145
Thank you, old friend.

264
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:37,087
You're going out with a bang.

265
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,739
Come on, Marshall.
Just admit that she's hotter than me.

266
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,164
I won't be hurt.

267
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,426
Can't do it.

268
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,927
- You're hotter.
- She's a goddess!

269
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:48,426
Her skin glows.

270
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:50,425
Her legs go for miles.

271
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,700
And that ass?

272
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,064
I would wear that thing for a hat.

273
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,118
Last night in bed, I'll admit it,

274
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:59,489
she popped into my head
a couple of times.

275
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:00,984
What are you try...

276
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,029
Like,
you think she's hotter than me?

277
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,386
I never said that.

278
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,552
- You do.
- It's apples and oranges.

279
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:11,490
She's younger than you.

280
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,312
I'm just saying, like,

281
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,428
me in my prime
versus her in her prime.

282
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:21,025
You guys,
her hotness isn't even real!

283
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,039
It's circumstantial hotness.

284
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:25,196
Watch.

285
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,199
II suppose you think
she's hotter than me, too.

286
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,303
What the hell are you doing?

287
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:50,013
You're not allowed back here.

288
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:54,142
Carl, look, I don't want to go back.

289
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:56,804
Please, don't make me go back.

290
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,129
You got to go.

291
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,733
I was somebody back there!

292
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:04,402
Everybody loved me.

293
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,581
Can we talk?

294
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,667
My roommate's about to get out
of the shower. Let's talk in my room.

295
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:33,723
Cindy, I know the University Rulebook
says we can't date.

296
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,268
But it also says, "Don't teach drunk,"
and I do that all the time.

297
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:38,717
The point is,

298
00:15:39,153 --> 00:15:40,021
I like you.

299
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:42,528
I do.
You're sweet, you're funny.

300
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,291
You're writing a dissertation,

301
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,824
Foreign Direct Investment
and Intergenerational Linkages

302
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:49,489
and Consumption Behavior.
I mean, that is hot.

303
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,758
I know this sounds crazy, but...

304
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,738
I feel like our paths
are supposed to cross somehow.

305
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:00,458
I don't want
to miss out on knowing you.

306
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:03,287
I don't want
to miss out on knowing you, either.

307
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:07,092
I got to tell you,

308
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,444
Just from looking around your room,
I can tell we have a ton in common.

309
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:12,720
Really?

310
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,880
The Unicorns?

311
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:16,114
Who Will Cut Our Hair
When We're Gone?

312
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,989
I have never met anyone else
who has this album.

313
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,354
That's my roommate's.
I borrowed it.

314
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,609
What about this?
World's End by T.C. Boyle?

315
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:28,984
That was a birthday gift...
from my roommate.

316
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:30,530
Haven't checked it out yet.

317
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,596
You should.
It's a good read.

318
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,536
What about this?
It's ridiculous.

319
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,739
You play bass?
Seriously, ask my friends.

320
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:42,041
I always say, my ideal woman...

321
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,802
does not play bass,
because this is clearly your roommate's.

322
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,505
She's in a band.

323
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,842
Damn, that's cool.

324
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,175
This is unbelievable.

325
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,807
You picked out the only three things
in here that are my roommate's.

326
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:59,559
- Does your roommate's band...
- Get out.

327
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,896
<i>Kids, as you probably guessed,</i>

328
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,190
<i>that wasn't the night
I met your mother.</i>

329
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:10,778
<i>Although I think
I glimpsed her foot.</i>

330
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:16,034
<i>But I did get a little bit closer
to meeting the woman of my dreams.</i>

331
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,890
And your mom...

332
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:20,252
<i>well, she got
her yellow umbrella back.</i>

333
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:22,873
It was just so special,

334
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:24,821
you know?

335
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,920
I feel like we should give him
a moment of silence.

336
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:30,739
Followed by, like,
20 minutes of grunting.

337
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,112
I'm gonna make you feel all better.

338
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,511
- Let me just go freshen up.
- All right.

339
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:41,767
Wait, that's not the bathroom!

340
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,050
Are these yours?

341
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,562
I'm suit-sitting for someone.

342
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,943
Barney, you lied to me.

343
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,915
You have to choose right now.

344
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,283
Me... or the suits.

345
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:06,351
<i>You're thinkin', "What's Barney
been drinkin'?" That girl's smokin' hot!</i>

346
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:10,515
<i>I coulda nailed her, but it's not
a failure. There's one thing she is not</i>

347
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,847
<i>To score a ten would be just fine,</i>

348
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,472
<i>but I'd rather be dressed
to the nines!</i>

349
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:18,013
<i>It's a truth you can't refute...</i>

350
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,054
<i>Nothin' suits me like a suit!</i>

351
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,148
<i>Picture a world Where all the boys
and girls are impeccably well-dressed!</i>

352
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,027
<i>That delivery guy in a jacket and tie.
That puppy in a double breast!</i>

353
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,052
<i>That eighties dude with muttonchops!</i>

354
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,115
<i>That baby with a lollipop!</i>

355
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,362
<i>That lady cop who's kinda cute!</i>

356
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:47,041
<i>Nothing suits them like a suit!</i>

357
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,362
<i>A wingman I can wear!</i>

358
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,361
<i>They're so debonair!</i>

359
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:55,216
<i>The perfect way to snare a girl
with daddy issues!</i>

360
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:57,209
<i>In navy blue or black!</i>

361
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,512
<i>Check out this perfect rack</i>

362
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,700
<i>I want to give them a squeeze!</i>

363
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:03,875
<i>Really!</i>

364
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,492
<i>Then answer these questions,</i>

365
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,430
<i>If you please.</i>

366
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:19,198
<i>What would you do if you had to choose
between your suits and a pot of gold?</i>

367
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,049
<i>What would you say if you gave
your suits and you'd never grow old?</i>

368
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,979
<i>What would you pick: one million chicks,
or a single three-piece suit?</i>

369
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:27,957
It's moot.

370
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,784
<i>What if peace
were within your reach?</i>

371
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,169
I'm gonna stop you right there.
It's suits.

372
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,130
Come on,
get your head out of your ass.

373
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,763
<i>Two, three, four!</i>

374
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,508
<i>Girls will go and girls will come,</i>

375
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,236
<i>but there's only one absolute!</i>

376
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,425
<i>Every bro on the go needs to know</i>

377
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,329
<i>that there's no accepted substitute!</i>

378
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,010
<i>I'm sorry, suits, let's make amends,</i>

379
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:55,362
<i>my Sunday best are my best friends!</i>

380
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,388
<i>Send Casual Friday down</i>

381
00:19:57,513 --> 00:20:01,366
<i>the laundry chute...</i>

382
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,681
<i>'Cause nothing suits</i>

383
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,225
<i>the undisputed!</i>

384
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,317
<i>Oft-saluted suitor of repute...</i>

385
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,165
Wait for it.

386
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,456
Then again, she is pretty hot.

387
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:52,313
I choose you, baby.

388
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,974
First thing tomorrow,
I'm getting rid of these suits.

389
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,421
Really?

390
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,305
You guys are fine.
