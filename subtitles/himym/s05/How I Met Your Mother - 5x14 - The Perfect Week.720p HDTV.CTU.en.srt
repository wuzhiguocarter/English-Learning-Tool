1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,210
<i>Kids, we all have different
ways of dealing with nerves.</i>

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,709
It'll just be a few more
minutes, Mr. Stinson.

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,537
<i>Some people chew their nails.</i>

4
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:10,324
<i>Some people tap their feet.</i>

5
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,512
<i>And some people imagine
they're being interviewed</i>

6
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,680
<i>by renowned sportscaster Jim Nantz.</i>

7
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, friends.

8
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:19,632
Every sport has had an icon
who transcends the game.

9
00:00:19,757 --> 00:00:22,404
Boxing had Ali,
basketball had Jordan,

10
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,732
and the sport of sleeping
with random hotties

11
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,652
has my next guest,
Mr. Barney Stinson.

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,454
- Barney, welcome.
- Thanks. Great to be back on the show.

13
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,816
Good to have you with us.
And, you know, the stats,

14
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,535
they really speak for themselves.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,245
Over 200 women spanning
six continents, 17 nationalities,

16
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:40,860
74 sexual positions

17
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:43,084
and not a single fatty.
It's impressive.

18
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,843
With these accomplishments, though,

19
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:48,269
there's one laurel
that's always eluded you.

20
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:51,050
Which brings us to last week.
What was the story there?

21
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:54,220
Buckle up, Jimbo,
this one's a doozy.

22
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:57,912
It all started when I decided
to set myself a little challenge.

23
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,537
He's calling his shot.

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,802
Whatever girl
I'm pointing to right now,

25
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:06,357
that's who I'm going
home with tonight.

26
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,038
Play ball!

27
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,548
How'd the date with Dale go?

28
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,718
You know, sometimes, that guy
with the horn-rimmed glasses

29
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,285
and the Smurfs T-shirt
is just being ironic.

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,134
Sometimes, he is a dork
with a lazy eye

31
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,601
and a love-hate relationship
with Gargamel.

32
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:30,065
Robin, just because
a guy talks a lot about

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,611
a fictional character on a first date
doesn't mean he's not husband material.

34
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:35,567
Sasquatch isn't fictional.

35
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,068
That was quick.

36
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:43,200
So, night one was pretty routine.

37
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:46,536
Jim, there is nothing routine
about the way I get down.

38
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:48,492
Respect.

39
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:49,748
Take us to night two.

40
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,500
See that hottie over there
nursing a Black Russian?

41
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:55,670
She's about to chase that
with a white American. Up top!

42
00:01:57,956 --> 00:01:59,006
You know...

43
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,692
if you're not careful,
you're going to lose me.

44
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,056
You guys, what should I say
when Dale calls for a second date?

45
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,087
How do you know he's going to call?

46
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:12,003
You're cute, Marshall.

47
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:15,315
But I think Mama knows
when a dude's digging the show.

48
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:18,234
I mean, he couldn't keep
his good eye off me.

49
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:21,198
Well, let him down easy.
People are fragile.

50
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:24,427
And sometimes, without
even meaning to, you might

51
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,271
rip someone's beating heart out
and stomp on it in a room full

52
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,765
of 26 people
and a teacher's assistant.

53
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:33,250
How did school go today, Ted?

54
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,876
Something bad happened.

55
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,170
The first class
of the new semester...

56
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:38,997
Jamie Adamic.

57
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:43,310
Brian Glow-atz.

58
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,116
Well done.

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,188
Adding a fake name
to the sign-up sheet.

60
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,854
That's real original, guys.
You know, I'd expect

61
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,676
inspired minds such as yours
to be a little more mature,

62
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,334
and frankly, more creative.
I mean, seriously.

63
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,989
What kind of a fake name is Cook Pu?

64
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:04,864
Here.

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,148
Come on, guys.
It's got to at least sound real.

66
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,727
Whatever happened to the classics?
Right, you know?

67
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:14,976
Seymour Butts.

68
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,712
Hugh Gerection. Those were fake names,
but Cook Pu?

69
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:20,088
Here.

70
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,520
She's back here, bro.

71
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:31,224
All right, come on, let me have it.
Bring on all the Cook Pu jokes.

72
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,692
We're not going to make jokes, Ted.

73
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:36,104
That girl must be
really down in the dumps.

74
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,961
You really... smeared the Pu name.

75
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,565
You guys finished?

76
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,945
Are you asking us if all the Pu
is out of our system?

77
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,469
Back-to-back nights.
Barney is on fire.

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,557
That girl's lucky.

79
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:53,904
Barney was the best sex I ever had.

80
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,749
He's the best friend I've ever had.

81
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:59,210
- He's everything I want Marshall to be.
- He's everything I wish I could be.

82
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:02,088
I'm just assuming that's what
they say when I'm not around.

83
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,049
I buy it. You're awesome.

84
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:05,633
Now, night three.

85
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,260
Paint us a word picture.

86
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,512
Jim, I could tell I was on a roll,

87
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,348
so I decided to mix things up
a little bit.

88
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,227
I think I'm going to go
small boobs tonight.

89
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:17,812
You're disgusting.

90
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:19,987
Lily, they're people, too.

91
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,368
- Here's your burgers.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,280
What, you're not sharing?
You two always share a burger.

93
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:28,275
We don't.

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,241
We're not like weirdos
who share everything.

95
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,826
- You are.
- Exactly.

96
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,536
We're perfectly normal!

97
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:34,996
What's going on?

98
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:38,324
You know how Lily and I have been
looking for new couple friends

99
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,610
ever since we lost Robin and Barney,

100
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,224
and Ted and Stella, and Ted and Robin,
and Ted and Victoria?

101
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,132
Geez, when are you going
to get your life?

102
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,634
How did we end up here?

103
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,603
We went on a great
double date last night.

104
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:53,040
It... we were cool.
We were casual.

105
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:54,282
We didn't spaz out.

106
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:57,055
And then, one tiny
little detail came out

107
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,686
and the whole night was ruined.

108
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:02,239
And Joeanna's toothbrush
flips off the side of the sink,

109
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:04,734
hits the ceiling and falls
right into the toilet.

110
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,172
- Come on.
- That's... That's crazy.

111
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:09,572
Last week, the same thing
happened to our toothbrush.

112
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:12,242
Our toothbrush?

113
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:14,119
Our toothbrush?

114
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:15,954
Our toothbrush?

115
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,124
Like, one toothbrush?

116
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:21,668
That you both use?

117
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,378
Every day?

118
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:24,963
Is that weird?

119
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:26,824
Super weird.

120
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:31,010
Marshall, four out of five dentists
just threw up in their mouths.

121
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,664
Check it out.
Barney's leaving with another girl.

122
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,811
Three girls in three nights.
That's gross, even for Barney.

123
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:42,397
Are you kidding?
He's on his way to a perfect...

124
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,107
Don't say it!

125
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,360
- You'll jinx it.
- Jinx what?

126
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:49,320
I was on my way toward...

127
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:51,547
a perfect week.

128
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,353
Synchro: ShalimarFox, -Titou-

129
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:05,712
.:: www.sous-titres.eu ::.

130
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:07,839
The perfect week.

131
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,217
Seven nights, seven girls,
zero rejections.

132
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:12,277
Incredible.

133
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:15,156
I mean, it's really
like the sexual equivalent

134
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,265
of baseball's perfect game,
but even rarer.

135
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,700
Yeah.
The only player in history

136
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,205
to have ever achieved both

137
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,189
was Mustache Pete Drexell
back in 1896.

138
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:31,029
Now, this wasn't the first time
you'd come close to a perfect week.

139
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,289
You learned the hard way, though...

140
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,783
one mistake, and it's all over.

141
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,721
<i>Sometimes,
a teammate makes an error.</i>

142
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:42,790
<i>Sometimes, one wild pitch...</i>

143
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:46,586
You, me, the canned food aisle
in the bodega next door.

144
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,204
<i>... leads to a walk.</i>

145
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,243
<i>And sometimes, you just lose focus.</i>

146
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,942
<i>And that almost always leads
to a hit.</i>

147
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,489
But this week,
you were three for three

148
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:01,267
with no sign of slowing down.

149
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,935
I could do no wrong.

150
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,897
Wish I could say the same
for my friends.

151
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,858
Cook didn't show up for class today.

152
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:10,368
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:15,698
Yeah, Ted, we know, like,
a ton of people named Cook.

154
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:25,250
Here we go.
The dreaded Dale call.

155
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:27,969
It's my mom.

156
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:30,663
She's going through some pretty
major league health stuff.

157
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:33,483
God, why won't that guy call?

158
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,261
Wait a minute.
You want him to call?

159
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,845
No! Shut up.

160
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:41,641
Don't you guys have, like, a...
a toothbrush to share or something?

161
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:44,158
Yeah. When did you guys
even start doing that anyway?

162
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:47,105
Like, years ago. You should know.
We lived with you.

163
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:49,459
But you always
kept your toothbrush in the bedroom.

164
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,776
Also weird, by the way.

165
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:53,319
We kept it in the bathroom.

166
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,717
No, there was only one toothbrush
in the bathroom, and it was mine.

167
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:01,605
Wait.

168
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,530
Are you saying...

169
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,800
... that for eight years,

170
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,835
All three of you
shared one toothbrush?

171
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,011
- Oh, my God.
- Kill me.

172
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:20,138
So, you're through four nights.
You're over the hump.

173
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:21,139
Nice.

174
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,640
I try. I'm no you.

175
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:28,521
But then came night five,
and with it, trouble.

176
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:31,607
Beer here.

177
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,491
How's Barney doing tonight?

178
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,244
Cool as a cumber.
Just like he's been all week.

179
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:45,205
- That's hard to believe.
- Why?

180
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:47,998
Apparently, this big merger
fell through last week

181
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,734
and Barney's being blamed for it.

182
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,794
That's weird.
He hasn't said anything.

183
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:54,542
I work with the guy.
I didn't find out until this afternoon,

184
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,174
when I walked by his boss's office.

185
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,499
<i>... you cost this company, Stinson?!</i>

186
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:00,470
I'd never seen Barney
look that scared.

187
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:03,527
I think he's going to get fired.

188
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,759
I can't believe he might get fired.

189
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,263
They're having a meeting on Friday
to determine if he keeps his job.

190
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,277
Poor guy. He must be freaking out.
I'm going to go talk to him.

191
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:24,261
You can't distract a man
in the middle of a... you-know-what.

192
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,378
Come on, this is his career.

193
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:29,344
This is much more important
than some stupid perfect...

194
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,835
You can lick my hand
as long as you want.

195
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,754
I'm not going to let you ruin his...

196
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,535
Guys, we need to talk to him.

197
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:39,806
I'll go.

198
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,454
He needs a bro.

199
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,529
- Everything all right?
- Absolutely. Sure.

200
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,263
Top of the world.

201
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,680
Who am I kidding?

202
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:54,732
- I need your help.
- Anything, buddy. What is it?

203
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,255
Which one of these girls
looks the dumbest?

204
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:03,228
All right, kid.

205
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,680
Let's check the scouting report.

206
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,736
What about the heater?

207
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:16,474
High and outside?

208
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
All right.

209
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,446
I'd go with the slider.

210
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:28,905
Thanks, Skip.

211
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:34,090
So, what did he say?

212
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,927
He's going to take a swat
at the Hamburglar over there.

213
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,797
You were supposed to talk to him
about losing his job.

214
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,851
How is forcing him to dwell
on a problem he can do nothing?

215
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,353
How is ignoring it
going to solve anything?

216
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:49,069
You ignored good dental hygiene

217
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:50,773
for the better part of a decade...

218
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:51,974
Cook Pu!

219
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:55,028
- Dale call yet?
- Why do you got to...

220
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:56,103
Guys, look!

221
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,816
I'm going to stop you.

222
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,484
There's a thing I have to ask.

223
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,321
Have you ever used
performance-enhancing drugs?

224
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:07,644
No, sir.

225
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,033
I respect the game too much.

226
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:13,704
Although,
I can't say I haven't been offered.

227
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,968
Dude, it was pretty awesome.

228
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:22,472
You should try it.
I have, I have some more.

229
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:23,839
No, thanks.

230
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:24,986
You sure?

231
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:27,345
All right, suit yourself.

232
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,680
What time is it?

233
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:31,719
It's 8:00.

234
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:42,190
I need to go to the hospital.

235
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,528
I'd never touch the stuff.

236
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,456
You can test me if you want,
Jim Nantz.

237
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:51,501
Barney, I trust you.
I regret I even asked you the question.

238
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,683
Let's go to night six.

239
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:56,390
Two girls away from perfection.

240
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,135
What are you doing here?
Get down to the bar!

241
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:02,622
Ted, relax.

242
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,097
I'm already six for six.

243
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,338
Really?

244
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,052
I was lunching
at Tavern on the Green,

245
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,219
I started chatting up
this Swedish supermodel.

246
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:12,333
Next thing you know,
I'm playing a day game

247
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,659
in the back
of a horse-drawn carriage.

248
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,664
Giddy-what-up?!

249
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:21,730
Awesome.

250
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,319
What really happened?

251
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:26,035
I had lunch at a Staten Island Chili's
and banged a drunk hairdresser.

252
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,495
Are you happy, Truthy McGee?

253
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,169
We know you might get fired.

254
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:38,157
Wait, you have to talk about this.

255
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,532
You are just using meaningless sex

256
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:43,177
to distract yourself
from a really serious issue.

257
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:45,344
It is not meaningless, okay?

258
00:12:45,469 --> 00:12:47,890
Number five and I really connected.

259
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,531
She's going back to school.

260
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:53,187
Or has a kid in school...
Something about school!

261
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:58,471
So, today one of my students told me
Cook is dropping my class.

262
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:01,603
Pu dropped out?

263
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,324
She is flushing her education
down the toilet!

264
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,701
Any word from Dale?

265
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,953
It's only been five days,
he's gonna call!

266
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,414
Why do you care anyway?
You said he was a total dork.

267
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:13,657
Do not talk about Dale that way.

268
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:16,285
He is twice the man
you will ever be!

269
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:20,097
God forbid, if you can't find
another job, sell your place.

270
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:23,426
Marshall and I have an extra room.
You can stay there as long as you need.

271
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,460
Make sure
you bring your own toothbrush.

272
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,157
Lily, what are you doing?

273
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,891
Talking to my friend
who's going through a really tough time.

274
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:31,684
He's doing fine.

275
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,491
Trying to sleep
with seven women in seven nights

276
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,156
is not "doing fine,"

277
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:37,940
it's a cry for help.

278
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:39,682
Barney's life is a cry for help.

279
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:42,482
But you don't mess with a man
when he's in the middle of a perf...

280
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,572
What?
Perfect week?

281
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,156
Perfect week!

282
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,279
Grow up!

283
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,783
Unbelievable.

284
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,875
You know,
there's two things you don't do.

285
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:59,161
One: you don't open an e-mail
from Phil Simms in front of your kids.

286
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,632
And two: you don't jinx a man
going for a perfect week.

287
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:05,009
I don't know what to tell you.
Lily's messing.

288
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,502
I think
she has a thing for the Barnacle.

289
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,683
You're a keen observer
of the human condition, Jim Nantz.

290
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,812
- I can't believe you jinxed him.
- He doesn't stand a chance.

291
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:16,979
Question:

292
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:18,819
If I ruined everything,

293
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:20,938
why is Barney totally hitting it off

294
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,111
with Third Martini Girl over there?

295
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:27,597
- He's going to do it!
- See?

296
00:14:27,722 --> 00:14:29,742
There is no such thing as a jinx.

297
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,663
Tell me she didn't say
"There's no such thing as a jinx".

298
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:34,780
Wish I could.

299
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:37,542
You were about to achieve
something so beautiful!

300
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,129
Thanks to her, the only thing
that could ruin a surefire hookup

301
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:43,965
was about to walk through that door.

302
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:50,487
A member of the 2009

303
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:53,757
World Champion New York Yankees.

304
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,803
Lily, I'm getting my own toothbrush.

305
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:10,701
I guess that's it.

306
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:13,238
- Barney's streak ends at six.
- What?

307
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:16,105
Why? Because of that guy
with the weird hair?

308
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:17,694
That's Nick Swisher.

309
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:20,052
He's a New York Yankee.

310
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,992
No normal guy in New York City
can compete with a Yankee.

311
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,627
It doesn't even have to be a Yankee.
When I first moved here,

312
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:29,712
I was on a fourth date with a girl,
until I got rack-jacked

313
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:30,911
by Phil Rizzuto.

314
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,706
I was there.
Holy cow, that guy had game.

315
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:35,718
I'm not seeing it.

316
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,002
Let me try
to Canada this up for you, eh?

317
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:41,498
How would you react
if one of those Ca-chuck guys

318
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:44,508
with the skates and the sticks
walked in here?

319
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:48,821
If one of the Vancouver Canucks
walked in here,

320
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,487
my panties would drop so hard,

321
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:52,669
there'd be a hole
in the floor halfway to China.

322
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:55,480
- That's what it's like with them.
- Well, Barney's screwed.

323
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,229
It's happening! Look.

324
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:01,400
Want to come over
and look at my snow globe collection?

325
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:02,776
Snow globe collection?

326
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,403
He's throwing junk out there.

327
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:08,396
That is Nick Swisher!

328
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,899
- Good effort.
- Good game.

329
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,371
Not good enough.

330
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,449
This whole week was a waste.

331
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:19,969
And tomorrow,

332
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:21,954
I'm going to get fired.

333
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,317
I'm really sorry, dude.

334
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,285
But for what it's worth,
this week wasn't a waste.

335
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,383
We were all having

336
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:34,257
a really horrible week
and you took our minds off it.

337
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,192
I had my first student drop my class...
It sucked.

338
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,570
I met my soul mate
and he never called me back.

339
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:41,245
I mean yet.
He will.

340
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,192
He will.

341
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,279
We scared off a really great couple
just because we share a toothbrush.

342
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,782
You share a toothbrush?

343
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,492
Them and Ted.

344
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,631
Wait a second.

345
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:56,640
When we were dating, you borrowed
that toothbrush all the time.

346
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:02,381
<i>And that's when Aunt Lily realized
what's great about sports:</i>

347
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:05,422
<i>They take your mind off your troubles,
if only for a moment.</i>

348
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:08,478
<i>And deep down,
we all need that perfect week.</i>

349
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:13,597
The second she sits down
next to Swisher, it's all over.

350
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,994
Wait a minute!

351
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,145
<i>Aldrin's got a bead on her!</i>

352
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:26,513
<i>She's running out of room.</i>

353
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:27,778
<i>She dives...</i>

354
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,476
I have no idea where she's going.

355
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,492
Are you okay?

356
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,392
Sorry.
I'm such a klutz!

357
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:40,624
I think I twisted my ankle.
Can you get me some ice?

358
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:41,712
Of course.

359
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:43,895
She did it!

360
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:46,380
I guess there is no such thing
as a jinx!

361
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,804
I'll get you some ice, Lily.

362
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,690
Damn it.

363
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,067
Swisher's back in play!

364
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,101
Follow me.

365
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:03,305
This guy and his wife
share a toothbrush!

366
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:04,634
So?

367
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,317
That's weird, right?

368
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,319
I think it's kind of sweet.

369
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,609
In a way, aren't we all trying
to find that special someone

370
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:15,284
to share a toothbrush with?

371
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:16,693
Excuse me.

372
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,871
Nick Swisher thinks we're sweet.

373
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,286
Martini?

374
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:24,835
We're having a beer with a Yankee.

375
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,378
How cool is that?

376
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,096
It's amazing.
I totally follow baseball.

377
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,508
Mookie Wilson, is that a thing?

378
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:33,767
Baseball, it's amazing.

379
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:36,096
But I tell you one thing,
it's no hockey.

380
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:37,875
I live...

381
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:39,844
right upstairs.

382
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,669
What do you say
we go back to my place?

383
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:46,607
To be honest,

384
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,355
I don't normally do that, but...

385
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,086
I feel a real connection here,

386
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:52,362
seven... Christy.

387
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,630
Please.

388
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,067
I did it!

389
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,548
Amazing!

390
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,967
Congratulations
on your perfect week!

391
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:16,852
I couldn't have done it
without my teammates.

392
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,222
On to a new topic.

393
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,974
Do you really think
you might get fired today?

394
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:26,063
Jim, I told you
I don't want to talk about that.

395
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,082
I'm a figment of your imagination,
so apparently you do.

396
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,611
Think about that.

397
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:35,285
What a jerk.

398
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,206
You're a jerk.

399
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,286
Mr. Donovan will see you now.

400
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,292
We've reached a decision.

401
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,763
We're keeping you on.

402
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,758
I know this past week
must have been tough on you.

403
00:19:56,382 --> 00:19:57,632
I barely slept.

404
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,216
Here you go.

405
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:03,267
The official hat
of Barney's perfect week.

406
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:06,254
I was going to do shirts,
but you have to guess sizes.

407
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,063
And feelings get hurt.
It's a mess.

408
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:12,875
In commemoration of Barney's induction
into the Hall of Game,

409
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:17,179
this tie, worn on the seventh night
of his perfect week,

410
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,574
is hereby retired.

411
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:21,256
May Barney's heroic feat
be remembered

412
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:23,787
and spoken of
for generations to come.

413
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:27,801
I'm totally going
to sit my kids down one day

414
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,836
and tell them about the time
Barney nailed seven chicks in a row.

415
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:34,753
<i>Am I a bad dad?</i>

416
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:39,738
Take out order for Cook Pu?

417
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:42,823
We have a number two over here
for Cook Pu.

418
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:45,284
You guys got Wendy saying it now?

419
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,458
Come on, I get it.

420
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,333
Cook Pu is a stupid name,
it gets stupider the more you say it.

421
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:55,335
Here.

9999
