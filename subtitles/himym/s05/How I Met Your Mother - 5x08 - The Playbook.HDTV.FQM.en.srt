<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, the secret to dating
is very simple:</i>

2
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,334
<i>Be confident, be comfortable
in your skin,</i>

3
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:10,067
<i>be assured of who you are.</i>

4
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>Uncle Barney was really good
at that last one,</i>

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,567
<i>even though a lot of the time
who he was was someone else.</i>

6
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,601
Hi. Do you see that guy
over there in the scuba suit?

7
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,067
You thinking of going
and talking to him?

8
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,167
No.

9
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,367
Good. He's seriously
the biggest jerk

10
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:30,133
on the face of the Earth.

11
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,434
How do you know him?
Oh, he's one of my best friends.

12
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:34,434
So what's with the scuba suit?

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,234
Well, it's a long story.

14
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,334
See, he just went through
a breakup...

15
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:40,733
<i>NARRATOR:
There's two basic philosophies</i>

16
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,733
<i>of how to handle yourself
after a breakup.</i>

17
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,668
<i>Some people throw
themselves into...</i>

18
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,267
My career. That's my number one
focus right now.

19
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:48,767
From now on, no more dating.

20
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,434
It's all about work.

21
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,434
<i>NARRATOR:
While others throw

Every woman in New York City.

23
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right, Barney Stinson
is back on the market.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,501
Mothers, lock up your daughters.

25
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,967
Daughters, lock up
your MILSWANCAs.

26
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:03,900
MILSWANCAs?
Wait, I can get this.

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,067
Mothers I'd Like To Sleep With
And Never Call Again.

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,000
Correct!
Cile gets the square.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,700
Don't you think you're kinda
rushg back into this?

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,668
Lily, since I started dating
Robin, there's a certain

31
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:17,700
<i>thing I haven't used as much
as I would like to.</i>

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,000
It's... kinda big,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,668
surprisingly heavy,

34
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:24,700
kind of leathery,
and it's black.

35
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,467
Huh?

36
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:29,434
This, my friends...

37
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,267
is The Playbook.

00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:50,100
every scam, con, hustle,

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,401
hoodwink, gambit, flimflam,

43
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,967
stratagem and bamboozle
I've ever used--

44
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:56,833
or ever hope to use--
to pick up chicks

45
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,201
and give them the business.

46
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:01,700
Wow, you wrote
another book?

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,000
Uh... we got a...
Stephen King over here.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,301
It's all in here.

49
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:12,700
Everything from basic moves like
"The Don't Drink That."

50
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,800
Whoa, don't drink that.

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,634
I saw some guy
slip something in there.

52
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,000
What? Who?

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,467
Uh...

54
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,334
that guy.

55
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:24,700
(Ted grunts)

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,301
Thank you.

57
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,734
To more advanced maneuvers
like "The Mrs. Stinsfire."

58
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,901
Now Kappas, after our
disciplinary hearing

59
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,000
for lewd behavior last semester,

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,534
we have been aigned
a new housemom.

61
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:44,033
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Stinsfire.

62
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,901
Hello, girls!

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,467
Wow. I can't picture

64
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,801
a way that wouldn't work.

65
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:57,917
What's
"The Loreo Von Matterhorn"?

66
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,217
I'm glad you asked.

67
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,084
"The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn"
will be

68
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:03,251
my grand return to the stage.

69
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,251
Or you know, the bed.

70
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,351
Actually, my bed
is kind of on a stage.

71
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:09,117
I put a platform underneath,
and got some lights going.

72
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:11,551
It's a real production.
Barney exits!

73
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,984
So, how about you,
Robin?

74
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,150
You getting back
out there?

75
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,484
Where is your playbook?

76
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:17,651
My playbook?
Yeah.

77
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,451
Bro, uh, two-volume
set, right here.

78
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,984
It's a great read
actually.

79
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,750
Yeah, I'm reading
it right now.

80
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,384
Anyway, I told you already, I'm
taking a break from all that.

81
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:29,117
Mm, mm. Marshall,
it's totally gonna happen.

82
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:30,883
So gonna happen.
What's gonna happen?

83
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:33,017
You're gonna fall in love.
So soon.

84
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:35,417
(laughs) Not likely I'm
focusing on my career.

85
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:36,517
I'm done with dating.

86
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,651
<i>Oh, okay, we playing
The Pyramid?</i>

87
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,783
Okay, uh,
"Things people say

88
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:41,750
right before they meet
the love of their life."

89
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,984
Ooh! Kelly Harris,

90
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:45,451
girl I went
to law school with said...

91
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,017
(Marshall's voice):
Hey, law school'so hard,

92
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,984
I just want to focus
on my studies.

93
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:49,783
Six months later?

94
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:51,718
<i>Married!</i>

95
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:52,817
We, that's all
well and good...

96
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,184
Travis Frenchroy, backup
bartender tells me...

97
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,917
(Ted's voice): Oh, I'm so
over the whole dating game.

98
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,950
<i>I just want to focus
on my Star Trek fan fiction.</i>

99
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,783
Six months later...

100
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,017
<i>Married!</i>

101
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:04,718
May I respond?
Mm-hmm

102
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,351
Well, that's all well
and good for them...

103
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:09,917
Matthew Blitz,
accountant at my office says...

104
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,618
(Marshall's voice):
Oh, I'm gonna die
single and alone.

105
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,684
I might as well just focus
on this year's taxes.

106
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:15,850
Six months later?

107
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:23,150
Protest all you want,
but it's gonna happen.

108
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,351
It's a law of nature.

109
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,050
Lawyered. Of nature.

110
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,284
Believe me, I'd love to have
no interest in a relationship.

111
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,917
There's no way
I'd be single right now

112
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,584
if I wanted to be single.

113
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:33,950
Okay, now you're ready.
Ready for what?

114
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,718
Three years ago,
this girl Shelly

115
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,117
started teaching
at my school.

116
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:38,684
The moment I saw
her, I was like,

117
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,618
"This is the girl for Ted."

118
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,017
Why am I just
hearing about her now?

119
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,017
Ah...

120
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,718
You know, I usually
hate being set up

121
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,917
but this Ted just
sounds so great.

122
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,217
Oh, he is.

123
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:50,417
He's so sweet and thoughtful
and intelligent.

124
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,750
MARSHALL:
Come on buddy!

125
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,384
One more chicken finger
and the crown is yours!

126
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:57,584
Hmm, I don't see him anywhere.

127
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,718
He must be out
doing charity work.

128
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:02,551
So, different bar?

129
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,284
(muffled): That girl with Lily's
pretty cute!

130
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,950
<i>Oh, yeah she was cute.</i>

131
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,217
Yeah, still is.
And now you're ready.

132
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:12,684
Yeah, bro, now
you can fit like,

133
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,517
three times as many
chicken fingers in your mouth.

134
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,351
You know it.
Okay, I will set it up,

135
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:19,184
but promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

136
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,718
I promise I won't do
anything stupid.

137
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,750
<i>And I kept that promise.</i>

138
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,417
<i>But only because...</i>

139
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,284
<i>she never showed up.</i>

140
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,917
I know. I'm sorry,
I feel terrible.
You should feel teible!

141
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,950
I do feel terrible! I do!
You should!

142
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,351
You should!
You should!
I do, I do!

143
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,984
I don't.

144
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:41,250
Look, I was really

145
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,384
looking forward to meeting Ted,

146
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,450
but I got to the bar
an hour early

147
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,083
and I met this amazing guy.

148
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,551
Like, seriously amazing.

149
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,751
And you met him at MacLaren's?

150
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,484
Yeah, right at the bar.
What's his name?

151
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:56,217
I shouldn't say.

152
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:58,018
Oh, what the heck.

153
00:05:58,018 --> 00:06:00,851
It's Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!

154
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:04,352
You son of a bitch.

155
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:11,817
So, he hooked up
with Shelly?

156
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:13,217
You must've been pissed.

157
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:14,651
Damn straight.

158
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:18,551
Barney, I've had Shelly set
aside for Ted for three years.

159
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:20,417
Dude, Ted was not missing out.

160
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,317
She's brainy and annoying,

161
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,618
kind of boring in the sack.

162
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,484
Oh, I guess she would've
been perfect for Ted.

163
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,551
Oops.

164
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:29,718
Ow! Ok.

165
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:31,850
Had I known that
she was there to meet Ted,

166
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,817
of course I wouldn't
have done it, but...

167
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:36,817
given the circumstances,
I think Ted'll be proud of me.

168
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:41,184
I pulled off
"The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn."

169
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:43,618
Okay, what's the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?

170
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:45,284
My question exactly.

171
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:47,817
Okay, what's the
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?

172
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:50,883
Glad you asked.

173
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:53,217

<i>Basic knowledge
of Web site design</i>

176
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:58,217
<i>and a very unique fake name.</i>

177
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:02,150
<i>So, think of your
fake name right now.</i>

178
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,684
<i>Have you got it? Good.</i>

179
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:05,984
<i>Now, select your target.</i>

180
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,584

182
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,284
(sighing)

183
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:18,050
Yeah, it's me.

184
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,817
Do I know you?

185
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,984
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

186
00:07:26,284 --> 00:07:28,517
Are you, like,
famous or something?

187
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:32,451
Yes.
(laughs)

188
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:37,718
What a refreshing
change of pace.

189
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:38,783
Nice to meet you...

190
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:40,684
Shelly.
Shelly.

191
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:43,584
Once again,
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

192
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,451
Spelled like it sounds
two "T"s.

193
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:48,984
Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

194
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:51,451

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,451
<i>and does an Internet search

198
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:00,718

202
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:08,384
<i>There's the fake

203
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:09,718
<i>about Lorenzo,

00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:14,917

<i>And by the time you get back..</i>

211
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,818
Hi, Shelly,
uh, I hate to be forward,

212
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,117
but can I buy you
a cup of coffee?

213
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:28,350
Yes! Please.

214
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,250
What does coffee go
for these days, $50?

215
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,951
(laughs):
Oh, Lorenzo.

216
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,817
<i>And it is on.</i>

217
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,550
That's awful.

218
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,784
You realize you broke
her heart, right?

219
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,118
She's inconsolable.

220
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:46,618
Why would she be inconsolable?

221
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,951
Lorenzo's balloon
won't disappear over the Arctic

222
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:50,450
for another week.

223
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,918
The only way she would
be upset is if someone

224
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:55,018
told her it was all
a bunch of lies.

225
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,417
It was all just
a bunch of lies?

226
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,250
It was all just a bunch of lies.

227
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,417
The balloon expedition?
Lies!

228
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,350
The man-made island
shaped like his face

229
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,517
off the coast of Dubai?
Lies!

230
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:08,150
Finishing third
in the laser tag competition?

231
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,617
Li-- Oh, actually,
that one's true.

232
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:10,918
I went to that.

233
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,050
You went to the Vatican?

234
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,317
Lies!

235
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,050
Oh, my God!

236
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,651
Well, I hope you're
happy with yourself.

237
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,417
What?
You broke that girl's heart.

238
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,150
Me?
You!

239
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,918
She'll probably never
trust a guy again.

240
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:28,551
You ruined her for Ted.

241
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,817
Not to mention
Julio Von Matterhorn,

242
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,384
Lorenzo's twin brother.

243
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,851
Can you believe that?

244
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,317
He blames me

245
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,551
Oh, and by the way, Ted,

246
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,050
I bet she'd still
go out with you.

247
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,350
Hm, let me think.

248
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,417
Do I want to go out with
a girl Barney hooked up with?

249
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,884
Guys, help me out
with the harmonies.
Sure.

250
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,684
* Hell no...
* Hell no...

251
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,918
* Hell no...
* Hell no...

252
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,951
Well, you must be a
little bothered by this.

253
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,484
Well, it's his life.

254
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:58,751
Look, if these girls are dumb
enough to fall for this crap,

255
00:09:58,751 --> 00:09:59,984
Agreed.

256
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:02,250
Have you seen the one
there labeled "The SNASA"?

257
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:06,650
Wow, you're an astronaut?

258
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,184
Shh!

259
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:11,650
I'm actually in a top secret
government space program

260
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,384
called Secret NASA
or SNASA.

261
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:19,351
Wow, SNASA.
Mm-mm.

262
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,683
Do you go to the Moon and stuff?

263
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,317
Well, not the Moon
you're familiar with,

264
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:25,783
though I have been
to the Smoon.

265
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,583
Wow, the Smoon.

266
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,251
If you fall for that one,
my heart breaks for you,

267
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,717
but I'm sorry,
you're a smoron.

268
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:39,517
So, what happens next?

269
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:40,817
Well...

270
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:43,151
Come on, Barney,
you just...

271
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,418
You just got out of an
honest to God relationship.

272
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:49,051
(sighs)
You're a real boy now.

273
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:51,517
You can't go back
to these cheap tricks.

274
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,184
Cheap tricks?!

275
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,184
Not one of these
is a cheap trick.

276
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,184
Except for "The Cheap Trick."

277
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,517
I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.

278
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:06,284
And even that one involves
expensive hair extensions.

279
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,884
Now, if you don't mind,

280
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:10,851
I am off to prepare for
tonight's main event.

281
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:14,051
I will be performing
"The He's Not Coming."

282
00:11:14,051 --> 00:11:16,250
Glad you asked.

283
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:19,317
<i>BARNEY:
To perform
"The He's Not Coming,"</i>

284
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:20,617
<i>here's what you'll need:</i>

285
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:22,517
<i>The observation deck
of the Empire State Building.</i>

286
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:23,684
<i>Are you  there?</i>

287
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,250
<i>Good.</i>

288
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,317
<i>For generations,
this has been the spot</i>

289
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:29,517
<i>New Yorkers have chosen
for their romantic reunions</i>

290
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,617
<i>with long-estranged lovers,
so all you have to do</i>

291
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:35,617
<i>is walk up to every girl you see
and say..."He's not coming."</i>

292
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:36,817
What are you
talking about?

293
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:38,584
Never mind.

294
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,051
He's not coming.

295
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,584
He's not coming.

296
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,851
She's not coming?

297
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,951
Sorry.

298
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:51,084
<i>Until sooner or later...</i>

299
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:53,051
(sighs)

300
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,350
He's not coming.

301
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,751
He's not?

302
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,517
But we agreed.

303
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,517
We always said
we'd meet here.

304
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,051
On this night.

305
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:04,118
(gasps)

306
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:07,151
(sobbing):
I'm such a fool.

307
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,550
Shh, shh, shh...

308
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,751
All right, I'm going
to go get the paper.

309
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,717
More like,
go get a husband.
Totally.

310
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:18,717
Okay, you guys need

311
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,051
to stop that, seriously.

312
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,084
The last thing I am looking for
right now is a relationship.

313
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:23,851
Uh-huh. When you
pick up that newspaper,

314
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:25,517
be sure to check
the wedding announcements.

315
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:26,851
(singsongy):
For yours.

316
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,917
MARSHALL:
Robin, it's like this.

317
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,450
Do you have any idea how
many times in my life

318
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,584
I've gone to t freezer

319
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,051
looking for frozen waffles
and not found them?

320
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,584
Thousands?
Millions.

321
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:37,550
But when I go to the freezer
looking for a Popsicle--

322
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,184
or the remote control because
Lily and I are having a fight

323
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:42,218
and she's hidden it there--
you know what I fi?

324
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:43,951
Frozen waffles.

325
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:44,917
That's how it works.

326
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,784
You go out there looking
for a paper,

327
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,417
you're coming back
with frozen waffles.

328
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:52,417
And, in this case, frozen waffles
is a guy.

329
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:55,717
Also, could you pick up
some frozen waffles?

330
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:59,218
In that case, frozen waffles...

331
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,450
are frozen waffles.

332
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,484
Guys, code red! Emergency.

333
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,550
Lock down. Nobody's leaving.

334
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,450
Whoa, what happened?

335
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,118
I tried "The He's
Not Coming,"

336
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,218
and it worked.
Gangbusters.

337
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:12,784
You should have
seen this girl.

338
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:15,051
Bang, ping,
pa-dowga-donk.

339
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,118
Okay, I'm leaving.

340
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:19,118
So, we get up to my place,

341
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,984
and I go into my room
to set up the camera--

342
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:22,951
to light the candles--

343
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,517
and when I come out,

344
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:28,151
she's gone,
and so is The Playbook!

345
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,617
I think we all know
who is responsible for this.

346
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:32,951
Yeah, we do.

347
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:34,017
Yeah.

348
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,417
Al-Qaeda.

349
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,550
No, you idiot.

350
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,517
It was me.

351
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:43,518
You son of a bitch.

352
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,143
Wow, you stole
The Playbook?

353
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,711
So, the girl on the
Empire State Building?

354
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,344
A friend of mine--
an actress.

355
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:57,843
An actress.

356
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,210
Of course.

357
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,311
That explains her impeccable
diction and her sluttiness.

358
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:04,412
Barney, I've got half a mind
to take that playbook

359
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,311
and put it up on the internet
for the whole world to see.

360
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:10,177
You wouldn't.
I won't, as long as you agree

361
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:13,210
to no more scams, no more cons,
no more hustles,

362
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,177
no more hoodwinks,
no more gambits,

363
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,711
no more stratagems
and no more bamboozles.

364
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:20,877
I notice you
left out flimflams.

365
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:22,477
No more flimflams!
Damn it.

366
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:24,710
Oh, my God.

367
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,744
I-I'm sorry to interrupt,
but look at this.

368
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,844
No.

369
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:35,077
I got left at the altar.

370
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,777
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

371
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:42,644
I wonder if that would work.

372
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:44,410
That's not even
the worst one in here.

373
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,278
Have you guys seen, uh,
"My Penis Grants Wishes"?

374
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:52,244
Really?
A genie comes t of it?

375
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:54,578
Only if you rub it hard enough.

376
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:58,044
So, then, what happened?

377
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,444
It says here he breaks
into song,

378
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,610
and then the furniture comes
to life and dances with him.

379
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,211
It's not very well
thought out.

380
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:05,177
It's no
"Mrs. Stinsfire."

381
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:06,677
No, what happened
in real life?

382
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:08,810
Well, a few
hours later...

383
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,977
(banging on door)

384
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:18,344
You know,
I heard it was gonna rain.

385
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:19,978
If anyone's interested,

386
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:22,510
I will be at MacLaren's Pub
performing a play

387
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,410
out of The Playbook entitled "The Scuba diver"

388
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,844
That is all.

389
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:30,711
Okay, that's it.

390
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,711
I'm putting The Playbook up
on the Internet.

391
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,210
Baby, can you put The Playbook
up on the Internet?

392
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,444
Yeah. Of course, baby,

393
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:38,911
but here's the...
here's the weird thing.

394
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:41,277
I have literally been through
this book cover to cover.

395
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:43,911
There is no play in here
called "The Scuba Diver."

396
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,544
<i>BARNEY:
Oh.</i>

397
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:50,410
So, now you guys want to know
what "The Scuba Diver" is.

398
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,844
<i>Well, it was</i>

399
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,811
on the last page
of The Playbook,

400
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:57,544
but I ripped it out
just in case.

401
00:15:57,545 --> 00:15:58,745
Don't worry, though,

402
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:00,577
You're about to see it
in action.

403
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:02,477
See the blond over there
by the bar?

404
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:06,777
Tizzarget acquizzired.

405
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:09,077
Barney, don't do this.

406
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:10,211
You're so...

407
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:11,244
Ah, give it a rest, pest.

408
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:12,377
If anyone
should be mad,

409
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:13,610
it should be Rob.

410
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,877
She loves The Playbook.

411
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:17,244
I don't love
The Playbook.

412
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,310
What are you talk...?

413
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,777
The Playbook-- it's gold.

414
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,410
You got to admit
it's pretty spectacular.

415
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,977
Look, Barney, we just broke up.

416
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:27,244
I mean, yes,
the costumes are cute, but...

417
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:29,410
we just broke up.

418
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:34,011
Well, I didn't...
I didn't know you felt that way.

419
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:36,677
I guess I've been so wrapped up

420
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:37,977
in my own stuff that I...

421
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,410
Oh, crap,
she's looking over he.

422
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,377
Quick, everyone,
scatter.

423
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:45,011
That's it.

424
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:49,844
Hi. You see at guy
over there in the scuba suit?

425
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,944
And that brings us
to rig now.

426
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,644
Wow.

427
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,111
But... wait.

428
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,410
So, why is he
wearing scuba gear?

429
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,477
We don't know.

430
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,144
And it's killing us,
Claire.

431
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:02,544
It's killing us!

432
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:04,278
Let's go ask him.

433
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,811
So, what's
"The Scuba Diver"?

434
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,911
And this iClaire, by the way.

435
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:12,944
Hello, Claire.

436
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,644
My name is Lieutenant
Frank Lyman.

437
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:18,211
I train bomb sniffing
dolphins for the Balt...

438
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:20,577
You know what?

439
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:22,278
I'm... I can't...

440
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,044
I can't...
I can't do ts.

441
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,510
Robin...

442
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:27,477
I'm  so sorry.

443
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,644
I guess
this breakup's

444
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:32,343
been tougher on me
than I thought.

445
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,510
I think
this playbook

446
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,410
was just a way to take my mind

447
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:37,011
It's okay.

448
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:38,577
It's been tough on me, too.

449
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:39,711
I mean, look at me.

450
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:41,210
I've sworn off relationships.

451
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,377
She's so about
to get married.

452
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:44,544
I got to work
on my toast.

453
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:45,978
I got to make
sure my tux fits.

454
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,477
I will bang your heads together
like coconuts.

455
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,911
LILY:
Barney, I'm so glad

456
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,444
you're stopping this.

457
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,978
And-and, frankly,
the real Barney

458
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:56,644
is way cooler than any
of the fake Barney's

459
00:17:56,644 --> 00:17:57,611
in this any book.

460
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:58,744
Oh, is that right?

461
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,310
Claire, you've
probably heard a lot

462
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,478
about the real
Barney tonight.

463
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,310
Want to grab a
cup of coffee?

464
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,711
Claire, before you
turn him down,

465
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:08,311
I-I think you should know
that under this neoprene suit

466
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,810
with what appears to be

467
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,478
a tube sock stuffed
in the crotch.

468
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:13,111
Can of Pringles,
but go on.

469
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,010
...is an amazing guy.

470
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,511
He's fun

471
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:19,610
and one of my
best friends.

472
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,643
And he landed
this hottie.

473
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:23,977
He's a good guy.

474
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,177
Come on, Claire,
go out with him.

475
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:28,444
MARSHALL:
It's just a cup
of coffee, right?

476
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:30,478
Right? Come on.
ROBIN: Yeah.
LILY: Can't hurt.

477
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:31,677
All right, all right.

478
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,643
Let's t some coffee.

479
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,643
<i>NARRATOR:
And by the end of the night...</i>

480
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,377
I'm prd
of that guy.

481
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:41,910
To be that vulnerable
takes a lot of Prings.

482
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,044
(cell phone chiming)

483
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,444
Ooh. I got a text
from Barney.

484
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:48,110
Oh.
"Look under the table."

485
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,011
Oh.

486
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:54,611
It's a page from The Playbook.

487
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,011
What does it say?

488
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,978
's "The Scuba Diver."

489
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,044
<i>BARNEY:
Step one: tell a meddlesome
female friend</i>

490
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,244
<i>about The Playbook.
Step two: run play</i>

491
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,111
<i>on one of her coworkers,
king her so angry</i>

492
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,112
She steals the Playbook.

493
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,111
Step Three: Put on a scuba suit

494
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:09,411
and tell her you're going to do

495
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,111
<i>one more scam
called "The Scuba Diver"</i>

496
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:12,411
<i>on the hot girl
standing by the bar.</i>

497
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:14,544
<i>Your fend--
let's call her Lily--</i>

498
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:15,411
<i>goes and talks to the girl</i>

499
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:16,743
<i>and tells her
everything about The Playbook.</i>

500
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:18,211
<i>Now, here's where
it gets tricky.</i>

501
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,077
<i>When Lily and the girl ask
at "The Scuba Diver" is,</i>

502
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,111
<i>about your deep-seated
insecurities</i>

503
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,411
<i>which don't really exist</i>

504
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:24,677
<i>because-- let's face it--
you're awesome.</i>

505
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:26,544
<i>Feeling bad for you,
Lily talks you up</i>

506
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:29,111
<i>to the girl, who then agrees
to go get coffee with you.</i>

507
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:32,944
<i>And it... is... on.</i>

508
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,945
You son of a bitch.

509
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,011
I'll give you a call.
All right. Bye-bye.

510
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,143
Uh, for those of you
keeping score,

511
00:19:51,143 --> 00:19:53,210
"The Ted Mosby" works.

512
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,777
Shh.

513
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,978
Robin, here we go.
Say you don't want a relationship.

514
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,844
Well, the love of
your life is about

515
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:02,143
to walk through
the door,

516
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,510
and it's...

517
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,811
that guy.

518
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,310
Yeah, I'm not falling in love
with that guy.

519
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,410
Right, right, right,
because it's going to be...

520
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,011
th guy.

521
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:16,410
Mmm, I don't know.
The blue blazer's just,

522
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,177
like, not doing it for me, so...
Yeah, yeah.

523
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,444
You're right, 'cause here
he comes. It's that guy!

524
