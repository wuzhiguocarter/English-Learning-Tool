{\pos(192,220)}<i>be assured of who you are.</i>

<i>Uncle Barney was really good
at that last one,</i>

5
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,474
<i>even though a lot of the time
who he was was someone else.</i>

6
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:22,444
Do you see that guy
over there in the scuba suit?

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,333
You thinking of going
and talking to him?

8
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:30,446
Good. He's seriously the biggest jerk
on the face of the Earth.

9
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:33,338
- How do you know him?
- He's one of my best friends.

10
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:35,244
So what's with the scuba suit?

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,830
It's a long story. See, he just
went through a breakup...

12
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:43,223
<i>There's two basic philosophies of how
to handle yourself after a breakup.</i>

00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:47,469
My career. That's my number one
focus right now.

15
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:50,592
From now on, no more dating.
It's all about work.

16
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,875

themselves into...</i>

That's right, Barney Stinson

Mothers, lock up your daughters.

20
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:02,187
Daughters, lock up your MILSWANCAs.

21
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:04,872
- MILSWANCAs?
- Wait, I can get this.

Correct!
Circle gets the square.

24
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,071
Don't you think you're kinda
rushing back into this?

25
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:15,460
Since I started dating Robin,
there's a certain

26
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:18,119
thing I haven't used as much
as I would like.

27
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:20,455
It's... kinda big,

28
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,165
surprisingly heavy,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,247
kind of leathery, and it's black.

Don't drink that. I saw some guy
slip something in there.

What? Who?

48
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:22,586

00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:07,645
Actually, my bed

62
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,127
{\pos(192,210)}I put a platform underneath,

I'm taking a break from all that.

00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,937

- You're gonna fall in love.

71
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:34,138

Protest all you want,
but it's gonna happen.

92
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,557
- It's a law of nature.
- Lawyered. Of nature.

93
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,165
Believe me, I'd love to have
no interest in a relationship.

94
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,230
There's no way I'd be single right now
if I wanted to be single.

95
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,964
- Okay, now you're ready.
- Ready for what?

96
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,856
Three years ago, this girl Shelly
started teaching at my school.

97
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:41,364
The moment I saw her, I was like,
"This is the girl for Ted."

98
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,658
Why am I just hearing about her now?

99
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,358
{\pos(192,210)}You know,
I usually hate being set up

100
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,563
{\pos(192,210)}but this Ted just sounds so great.

101
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,066
He is. He's so sweet
and thoughtful and intelligent.

102
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,211
One more chicken
finger and the crown is yours!

103
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't see him anywhere.
He must be out doing charity work.

104
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,485
So, different bar?

105
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:11,778
- Yeah she was cute.
- Still is. And now you're ready.

106
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:14,855
Now you can fit like, three times
as many chicken fingers in your mouth.

107
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,184
- You know it.
- Okay, I will set it up, but,

108
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:19,568
promise me you won't do
anything stupid.

109
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,196
I promise I won't do
anything stupid.

110
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,240
<i>And I kept that promise.</i>

111
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,196
<i>But only because...</i>

112
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,207
<i>she never showed up.</i>

113
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,499
I know. I'm sorry, I feel terrible.

114
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,977
- You should feel terrible!
- I do feel terrible!

115
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,602
- You should! You should!
- I do, I do!

116
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:43,122
I don't. Look, I was really
looking forward to meeting Ted,

117
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,491
but I got to the bar
an hour early and I met this

118
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,098
amazing guy.
Like, seriously amazing.

119
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:51,392
And you met him at MacLaren's?

120
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,103
- Right at the bar.
- What's his name?

121
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,856
I shouldn't say.

122
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:01,144
What the heck.
It's Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!

123
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:05,156
You... son of the bitch.

124
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,248
{\PUB}So, he hooked up with Shelly?
You must've been pissed.

125
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,583
Damn straight.

126
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:19,710
{\pos(192,210)}I've had Shelly set aside
for Ted for three years.

127
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:21,893
{\pos(192,210)}Dude, Ted was not missing out.

128
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:25,268
{\pos(192,210)}She's brainy and annoying,
kind of boring in the sack.

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,770
I guess she would've been
perfect for Ted.

130
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,426
Had I known
that she was there to meet Ted,

131
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,465
of course I wouldn't
have done it, but...

132
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,195
given the circumstances,
I think Ted'll be proud of me.

133
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,732
I pulled off
<i>The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn</i>.

134
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:44,153
What's <i>The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn</i>?

135
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,863
My question exactly.

136
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,657
- What's <i>The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn</i>?
- Glad you asked.

137
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:54,204
<i>To perform

138
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:57,422
<i>here's what you'll need,
basic knowledge of Web site design</i>

139
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,166

140
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,784

right now.</i>

141
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,273

142
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,537
<i>Now, select your target.</i>

00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:10,062

145
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,888
Yeah, it's me.

146
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,186
Do I know you?

147
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,068
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

148
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,865
Are you, like, famous or something?

149
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,606
You really don't know
who I am, do you?

150
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:40,332
What a refreshing change of pace.
Nice to meet you...

151
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:45,254
Once again,
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.

152
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,964
Spelled like it sounds two "T"s.

153
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,639
<i>Then, as soon as you're gone,
she gets out her phone</i>

154
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,107
<i>and does an Internet search
for Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.</i>

155
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,604
<i>And that's when she discovers.</i>

156
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,906
<i>A series of fake Web sites,</i>

157
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:07,631
<i>all devoted to the incredible life
of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.</i>

00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:10,821
<i>There's the fake business article about

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,035
<i>the North Pole, a feat of pure
daring and imagination.</i>

161
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,627
<i>The fake medical journal
featuring the heartbreaking story</i>

162
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:21,612
<i>of doctors telling him penis reduction
surgery isn't an option.</i>

163
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,323
<i>And by the time you get back...</i>

164
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,254
I hate to be forward but,
can I buy you a cup of coffee?

165
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,508
Please.

166
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,384
What does coffee go
for these days, $50?

167
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,604
<i>And... it is on.</i>

168
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:41,685
That's awful.

169
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,232
You realize you broke her heart?
She's inconsolable.

170
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,593
Why would she be inconsolable?

171
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,903
Lorenzo's balloon won't disappear
over the Arctic for another week.

172
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,071
The only way she would be upset

173
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:55,366
is if someone told her it was all
a bunch of lies.

174
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:59,870
- It was all just a bunch of lies?
- It was all just a bunch of lies.

175
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,123
- The balloon expedition?
- Lies!

176
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,241
The man-made island
shaped like his face

177
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:06,210
- off the coast of Dubai?
- Lies!

178
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,879
Finishing third
in the laser tag competition?

179
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,632
Li... Actually, that one's true.
I went to that.

180
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,926
- You went to the Vatican?
- Lies!

181
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,518
Well, I hope
you're happy with yourself.

182
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,437
- What?
- You broke that girl's heart.

183
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,979
- Me?
- You!

184
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,940
She'll probably never trust
a guy again.

185
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:31,216
You ruined her for Ted.
Not to mention

186
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:34,363
Julio Von Matterhorn,
Lorenzo's twin brother.

187
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:38,401
Can you believe that? He blames me

188
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,288
And by the way, Ted,
I bet she'd still go out with you.

189
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,792
Let me think. Do I want to go out
with a girl Barney hooked up with?

190
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,967
Help me out with the harmonies.
Sure.

191
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,210
Hell no...

192
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,737
- You must be a little bothered by this.
- It's his life.

193
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,307
If these girls are dumb enough to fall
for this crap, they have it coming.

194
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,684
Agreed. Have you seen the one
there labeled <i>The SNASA</i>?

195
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,730
You're an astronaut?

196
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,969
I'm actually in a top secret
government space program

197
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,123
called Secret NASA

198
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,472
or... SNASA.

199
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:20,136
SNASA?

200
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,908
- Do you go to the Moon and stuff?
- Not the Moon you're familiar with,

201
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,641
though I have been to the Smoon.

202
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,087
The Smoon.

203
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,418
If you fall for that one,
my heart breaks for you,

204
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,345
but I'm sorry, you're a smoron.

205
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,347
So, what happens next?

206
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:43,891
Come on, Barney, you just...

207
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:48,395
You just got out on
an honest to God relationship.

208
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:50,421
You're a real boy now.

209
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,526
You can't go back
to these cheap tricks.

210
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,229
Cheap tricks?!
Not one of these is a cheap trick.

211
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,155
Except for <i>The Cheap Trick</i>.

212
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,535
I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick.

213
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,581
And even that one involves
expensive hair extensions.

214
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:11,543
Now, if you don't mind, I am off
to prepare for tonight's main event.

215
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,672
I will be performing
<i>The He's Not Coming</i>.

216
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:16,717
Glad you asked.

217
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:21,470
<i>To perform The He's Not Coming,
here's what you'll need,</i>

218
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,969
<i>the observation deck
of the Empire State Building.</i>

219
00:11:24,094 --> 00:11:26,143
<i>Are you up there? Good.</i>

220
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,349
<i>For generations, this has been
the spot New Yorkers have chosen</i>

221
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:32,135
<i>for their romantic reunions
with long-estranged lovers,</i>

222
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,069
<i>so all you have to do is walk up
to every girl you see and say:</i>

223
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,593
He's not coming.

224
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:39,434
- What are you talking about?
- Never mind.

225
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:40,906
He's not coming.

226
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:45,297
He's not coming.

227
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:48,092
She's not coming?

228
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,221
Sorry.

229
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,762
<i>Until sooner or later...</i>

230
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,631
He's not coming.

231
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:57,828
He's not?

232
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:02,790
But we agreed.
We always said we'd meet here.

233
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,370
On this night.

234
00:12:05,904 --> 00:12:08,550
I'm such a fool.

235
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,443
I'm gonna go get the paper.

236
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,925
- More like, go get a husband.
- Totally.

237
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,922
You guys need to stop at, seriously.

238
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,657
The last thing I am looking for
right now is a relationship.

239
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:26,944
When you pick up that newspaper, be sure
to check the wedding announcements.

240
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,069
For yours.

241
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:31,379
It's like this. Do you have any idea
how many times in my life

242
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:34,388
I've gone to the freezer looking
for frozen waffles and not found them?

243
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:35,979
- Thousands?
- Millions.

244
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:38,172
But when I go
to the freezer loing for

245
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:41,421
a Popsicle or the remote control
because Lily and I are having a fight

246
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:44,011
and she's hidden it there,
you know what I fi?

247
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,043
Frozen waffles.
That's how it works.

248
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:48,025
You go out there looking
for a paper,

249
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,559
you're coming back with
frozen waffles. And, in this case,

250
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,427
frozen waffles is a guy.

251
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,983
Also, could you pick up
some frozen waffles?

252
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,476
In that case, frozen waffles...

253
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:01,655
are frozen waffles.

254
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:06,992
Guys, code red! Emergency.
Lockdown. Nobody's leaving.

255
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,936
- What happened?
- I tried <i>The He's Not Coming</i>,

256
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,561
and it worked. Gangbusters.
You should have seen this girl.

257
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:16,977
I'm leaving.

258
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:19,880
So, we get up to my place,

259
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,677
and I go intmy room to set up
the camera... to light the candles...

260
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,344
and when I come out,

261
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:26,699
she's gone,

262
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,504
and so is The Playok!

263
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:32,519
I think we all know
who is responsible for this.

264
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,854
Yeah, we do.

265
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,357
Al-Qaeda.

266
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:38,719
No, you idiot.

267
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,361
It was me.

268
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:44,573
You... son of a bitch!

269
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,857
{\PUB}You stole The Playbook?

270
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,042
So, the girl on the
Empire State Building?

271
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,710
A friend of mine, an actress.

272
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:58,295
{\pos(192,210)}An actress.

273
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,621
{\pos(192,210)}Of course.

274
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,507
{\pos(192,210)}That explains her impeccable
diction and her sluttiness.

275
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,600
{\pos(192,210)}I've got half a mind
to take that playbook and

276
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,971
{\pos(192,210)}put it up on the Internet
for the whole world to see.

277
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,221
- You wouldn't.
- I won't, as long as you agree

278
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:14,245
to no more scams, no more cons,
no more hustles,

279
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,154
no more hoodwinks, no more gambits,

280
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,023
no more stratagems
and no more bamboozles.

281
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:21,276
I notice you left out flimflams.

282
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,544
- No more flimflams!
- Damn it.

283
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:27,074
I'm sorry to interrupt
but look at this.

284
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,366
I got left at the altar.

285
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,529
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

286
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,779
I wonder if that would work.

287
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:45,676
That's not even
the worst one in here.

288
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,720
Have you guys seen the
<i>My Penis Grants Wishes</i>?

289
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,808
Really?
A genie comes out of it?

290
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:55,334
Only if you rub it hard enough.

291
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,342
- So, then, what happened?
- It says here he breaks into song

292
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,844
and then the furniture comes
to life and dances with him.

293
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,029
It's not very well-thought-out.
It's no <i>Mrs. Stinsfire</i>.

294
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,491
- No, what happened in real life?
- Well, a few hours later...

295
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,680
You know, I heard it was gonna rain.

296
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:22,403
If anyone's interested,
I will be at MacLaren's Pub

297
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:26,049
performing a play out of
The Playbook entitled <i>The Scuba Diver.</i>

298
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:27,872
That is all.

299
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,508
That's it. I'm putting
The Playbook up on the Internet.

300
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,060
Baby, can you put The Playbook
up on the Internet?

301
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,906
Of course, baby,
but here's the weird thing.

302
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,612
I have literally been through
this book cover to cover.

303
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:45,444
There is no play in here
called <i>The Scuba Diver</i>.

304
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,491
So, now you guys want to know
what <i>The Scuba Diver</i> is.

305
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,939
Well, it was

306
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,079
on the last page of The Playbook,

307
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:58,582
but I ripped it out just in case.

308
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:01,990
Don't worry, though.
You're about to see it in action.

309
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:04,415
See the blond over there by the bar?

310
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,925
Tizzarget acquizzired.

311
00:16:08,462 --> 00:16:11,511
- Barney, don't do this. You're so...
- Give it a rest, pest.

312
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,182
If anyone should be mad, it should be
Robin. She loves The Playbook.

313
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,601
I don't love The Playbook.

314
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,536
What are you talk...?
The Playbook, it's gold.

315
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:22,759
You got to admit
it's pretty spectacular.

316
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,892
We just broke up.

317
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:27,778
I mean, yes,
the costumes are cute, but...

318
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,780
we just broke up.

319
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,493
Well...
I didn't know you felt that way.

320
00:16:36,385 --> 00:16:38,936
I guess I've been so wrapped up
in my own stuff that...

321
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:42,041
{\pos(192,210)}Crap, she's looking over here.
Quick, everyone, scatter.

322
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:45,695
That's it.

323
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,551
You see at guy over there
in the scuba suit?

324
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:52,845
And that brings us to rig now.

325
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:58,350
But... wait. So, why is he
wearing scuba gear?

326
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:02,562
We don't know. And it's killing us,
Claire. It's killing us!

327
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:04,189
Let's go ask him.

328
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,946
So, what's <i>The Scuba Diver</i>?
And this is Claire, by the way.

329
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:14,950
Hello, Claire. My name
is Lieutenant Frank Lyman.

330
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,412
I train bomb sniffing
dolphins for the Balt...

331
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,739
You know what?

332
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,867
I can't do this.

333
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,361
I am so sorry.

334
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:31,884
I guess this breakup's
been tougher on me than I thought.

335
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,684
I think this playbook was just a way
to take my mind off of things.

336
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,824
It's okay.
It's been tough on me, too.

337
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:42,185
I mean, look at me.
I've sworn off relationships.

338
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,912
- She's so about to get married.
- I got to work on my toast.

339
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:46,539
I got to make sure my tux fits.

340
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:49,514
I will bang your heads together
like coconuts.

341
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,275
I'm so glad you're stopping this.
And, frankly,

342
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,906
the real Barney is way cooler
than any of the fake Barneys

343
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,357
- in this playbook.
- Is that right?

344
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:02,464
Claire, you've prably heard a lot
about the real Barney tonight.

345
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,539
Want to grab a cup of coffee?

346
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,797
Before you turn him down,
I think you should know that

347
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:10,692
under this neoprene suit
with what appears to be

348
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:14,617
- a tube sock stuffed in the crotch...
- Can of Pringles but go on.

349
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,497
... is an amazing guy. He's fun

350
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,821
and one of my best friends.

351
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,559
And he landed this hottie.

352
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:24,913
He's a good guy.

353
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,442
- Come on, Claire, go out with him.
- It's just a cup of coffee, right?

354
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:33,026
- Can't hurt.
- All right, all right.

355
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:34,654
Let's t some coffee.

356
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,884
<i>And by the end of the night...</i>

357
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:43,330
I'm prd of that guy. To be that
vulnerable takes a lot of Pringles.

358
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,980
I got a text from Barney.

359
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,000
"Look under the table."

360
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:57,228
- It's a page from The Playbook.
- What does it say?

361
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,012
It's <i>The Scuba Diver</i>.

362
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,479
Step one, tell a meddlesome
female friend about The Playbook.

363
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,240
Step two, run play on one of her
coworkers, making her so angry

364
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,976
she's steals the Playbook.
Step three, put on the scuba suit and

365
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,603
tell her you're gonna do one more
scam called <i>The Scuba Diver</i>

366
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:15,584
on the hot girl standing by the bar.
Your friend, let's call her Lily,

367
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,823
{\goes and talks to the girl and tells her}goes tell the girl
everything about The Playbook.

368
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,197
{\Now, h}Here's where it gets tricky. When Lily
and the girl ask at <i>The Scuba Diver</i> is,

369
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:23,922
take off your mask, get them some
schmear about your deep-seated

370
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,483
insecurities which don't really
exist cause{\ let's face it} you're awesome.

371
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:29,328
Feeling bad for you, Lily talks you up
to the girl, who then agrees

372
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,634
to go get coffee with you. And it...

373
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,759
is...

374
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,159
on.

375
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,139
You... son of a bitch!

376
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,228
{\PUB}I'll give you a call.

377
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:54,953
For those of you keeping score,
"The Ted Mosby" works.

378
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,323
Here we go. You say
you don't want a relationship.

379
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,535
Well, the love of your life is about
to walk through the door,

380
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,753
and it's...

381
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:07,671
that guy.

382
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,261
I'm not falling in love
with that guy.

383
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:13,486
Right, cause it's going to be...

384
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:14,637
that guy.

385
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,884
I don't know. The blue blazer's just,
like, not doing it for me, so...

386
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,643
You're right, cause here
he comes. It's that guy!

387
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,575
You should at least give her a chance.
You know, make out with her a little,

388
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,359
see if there's sothing there.

389
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:33,273
- I'm going to work.
- Yeah, you are.

390
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,291
I'm actually going to work.

391
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:38,397
<i>And the ironic part was...</i>

392
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,017
Are you Robin?

393
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,866
I'm Don, your new cohost.

394
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,984
<i>That was the day she met Don.</i>

395
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,766
Damn it, Marshall.
