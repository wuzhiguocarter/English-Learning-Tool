00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,743
<i>Kids, on a warm March evening
in 2010</i>

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:05,909
<i>a New York City police boat
pulled a 34-year-old white male</i>

3
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:08,409
<i>out of the Hudson River:
your Uncle Barney.</i>

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,677
Let's hear the story.
From the beginning.

5
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,013
It all started a week ago.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,890
<i>I was making time
at the local watering hole.</i>

7
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:19,308
<i>Enter...</i>

8
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:20,938
<i>a dame.</i>

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,071
Nothing sexier than a man
in a fine cravat.

10
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,909
Except for a woman
who appreciates a fine cravat.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,579
How about we just call it a tie?

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,211
A cravat is a kind of tie.

13
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,009
- I get it.
- Anyway,

14
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,841
next thing you know,
I get her back to my place.

15
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:54,624
When I get in bed with a man,

16
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:58,184
my body becomes a machine
fueled by desire, lust

17
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,477
and a singular hunger to satisfy

18
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,769
my lover's every carnal need.

19
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,815
Good thing the cleaning lady
is coming tomorrow.

20
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,809
Well, good night.

21
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:12,946
What? Wait, what?

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,275
I thought your body was going
to become a machine

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,820
fueled by desire, lust
and a singular hunger

24
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,495
to satisfy my every carnal need.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,266
I really think that Don and I
are hitting our stride as a news team.

26
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:44,016
All credit
goes to this lady on my left.

27
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,310
That story you did on which rodents
to avoid on the subway...

28
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:49,277
The answer may surprise you.

29
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,048
It's all of them.

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,653
I got to run. I'll see you.

31
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,214
It's good to meet you.

32
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,224
That guy is awesome.

33
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,509
He's funny, he's smart,
he's handsome.

34
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,373
Scoop him up
before someone else does.

35
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,626
I hope you're not talking about you.

36
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,190
It has been four months
since you broke up with Barney.

37
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,422
Maybe it's time
to put yourself back out there.

38
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,676
Exactly. Barney's dating again,
and he couldn't be happier.

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,552
I couldn't be more unhappy.

40
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,096
All night long,
she's hot and heavy for me.

41
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,307
I get her back to my place,
and she just bolts?

42
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,755
I mean, at least,
when I run out on a girl,

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,726
I have the common courtesy
to sleep with her first.

44
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:29,254
It's called manners.

45
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,279
She read that book

46
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:34,422
<i>Of Course You're Still Single,
Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut</i>.

47
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:39,324
It's this book that helps single girls
find a husband.

48
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:43,703
It's Robin's copy.
I leafed through it a little bit.

49
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,602
Fine.

50
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,308
When you were with this girl,

51
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,382
did she subtly slip the word
"sex" into conversation?

52
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,976
I'm in the inter-sex-tion,

53
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:02,139
and I only have a couple of sex
before the light changes.

54
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,474
I mean, everyone's honking at me,

55
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,386
and it totally sex,

56
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,308
but I can't turn around

57
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,523
because a jogger slipped
and fell in horse sex-crement.

58
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,241
Go on. Go on.

59
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,988
Did she make excuses
to establish physical contact with you?

60
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,051
Is this cashmere?

61
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,575
Cashmere?

62
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,909
This is hand-spun virgin merino.

63
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,999
The fibers in this suit

64
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,583
are less than 12 microns thick.

65
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,763
12 microns.

66
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,205
I love a tiny fiber.

67
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,424
Well, you're in luck,
because mine's the tiniest.

68
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:40,777
And the more you touch it,

69
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,079
the softer it gets.

70
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,401
She did that, too.

71
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,741
Here is the final test.

72
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,480
Next time you see her,
ask her out for the following night.

73
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:56,342
The book says that's forbidden,

74
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,886
so she'll probably give you
some lame excuse like this:

75
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,208
"I can't do anything tomorrow night.

76
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,438
"I've already made plans
to clean my garbage disposal

77
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,081
"and treat myself to a bubble bath.

78
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,777
"But how about next week sometime?"

79
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:11,349
You're trying that
<i>Of Course You're Still Single,</i>

80
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,501
<i>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut</i>
crap on me.

81
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,670
It's not crap.

82
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,507
It is a brillant book!

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,510
It scares away guys
who are only interested in getting laid.

84
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,889
Why not just say you have a kid?

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,815
You'd be surprised how many jerks
there are out there.

86
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:30,394
That's why the book says
never sleep on the first date.

87
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,939
- Totally.
- On the second.

88
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,601
- Of course.
- Or on the third.

89
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,185
- Or on the fourth.
- Just tell me how many dates!

90
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:37,860
17.

91
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:42,771
Excuse me, is anyone using this?

92
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:50,739
Here it is:
no sex until after 17 dates.

93
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:55,033
If you're not going to take her out
on 17 dates, you should just give it up.

94
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,724
She is gonna give it up, not me.

95
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:01,785
Because, thanks to Ted's book...

96
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,453
That's Robin's.

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,144
I can stay two steps ahead of her
at all times.

98
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,667
There's a loophole in here somewhere
and I'm going to find it.

99
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,870
<i>Listen...</i>

100
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,467
you wanna go out Saturday night?

101
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,080
- Saturday night...
- Is he asking you out?

102
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:21,319
Say yes!

103
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:26,491
It's really sweet of you to ask,

104
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,811
and you're a great guy...

105
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,897
- I will go out with you.
- Robin, are you okay?

106
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,583
I just had a little cold.

107
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:37,713
That's probably what you're hearing.
But Saturday night sounds great.

108
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,755
We can even go to a steak house,

109
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,846
and you can bring home
some prime rib for my friend.

110
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,593
Gotta go. Love you. Bye.

111
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,262
What the hell are you thinking?

112
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,378
You've got to do this, okay?

113
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,445
A great guy like Don is rare.

114
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:53,543
And speaking of rare,

115
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:55,186
prime rib! Don't forget. Thank you.

116
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:00,835
I don't believe it.

117
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,445
This is her!

118
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,073
She wrote the book.

119
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:08,867
Her name must be Anita.

120
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:14,065
My plan was to sleep with her,
but this changes everything.

121
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:15,767
New plan:

122
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:18,838
I'm going to sleep with her.

123
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,549
Boy, this girl
that Barney's going after,

124
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,784
she kind of sounds
like the anti-Barney.

125
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:29,485
I love how the universe
decided to bring those two together.

126
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,925
Actually, Anita's going after Barney
because I told her to.

127
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:42,503
Wait, you sicced Anita on Barney?

128
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:45,227
- How do you even know her?
- She was on my show.

129
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:48,467
But, um, if you had
to summarize your book

130
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,511
in 30 words or less...

131
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:52,659
I'll summarize it in one word.

132
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:53,931
That word

133
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:55,140
is "no."

134
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:56,475
By saying no

135
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:59,520
constantly and consistently,
you empower yourself

136
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:02,483
while simultaneously
turning any jerk

137
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:05,359
into a submissive,
sniveling, puddle of a man.

138
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:07,993
And isn't that every girl's dream?

139
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:11,115
After the break, we're going to talk
about your new book,

140
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,244
<i>Of Course You Don't Have
a Retirement Plan Yet,</i>

141
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:16,286
<i>Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut,</i>
due out in June.

142
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,163
We'll be right back.

143
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,681
We're clear.

144
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,626
- You guys want any coffee?
- You know what, that'd be great.

145
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:23,794
You?

146
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:29,716
What about you? You dating anyone?

147
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,977
Dating's not really my bag
right now.

148
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,557
Somebody broke your heart?

149
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,436
And then, I told her everything.
It just came pouring out.

150
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,727
And by the end of it...

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,146
This Barney needs
to be taught a lesson.

152
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,066
You say the word,
and I will destroy him.

153
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:49,403
- What do you mean?
- I can use the power of "no"

154
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,206
to break your friend, Barney.

155
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:55,117
- Just say the word.
- That stuff doesn't really work.

156
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,619
- Does it?
- I didn't know what you wanted,

157
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,395
so I got you a cappuccino,
an espresso, a latte, a decaf...

158
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,542
And this is a Turkish coffee.

159
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,832
- Think about it.
- <i>I didn't think I would think about it,</i>

160
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:10,340
<i>but... I thought about it.</i>

161
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,162
This Pilates instructor
was off the charts.

162
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:18,457
Picture Robin, but younger.

163
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:21,208
And bigger boobs.

164
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:24,242
Maybe not bigger, but more shapely.

165
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:26,531
And bigger.

166
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:31,696
I get her up against the StairMaster,
and we...

167
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,280
- Do it.
- Spoilers.

168
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,032
- Anyway, we do it.
- It's done.

169
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,043
I know, it was stupid,

170
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:50,094
but you have to understand, back then,
I was really upset about the breakup.

171
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:51,965
I was going though
my mourning period.

172
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:55,844
There was a lot of scotch and a lot
of long nights at the shooting range.

173
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:58,169
I hope those weren't
the same nights.

174
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,144
It's not like I remember
all of them.

175
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:05,812
Did you know that Robin
was going through a mourning period?

176
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:08,899
- She seemed fine after the breakup.
- You know how she is.

177
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,729
She keeps her emotions to herself.

178
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:13,218
But yeah, I caught her crying
a couple times.

179
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,625
She cried?

180
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:16,572
Like, real tears?

181
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,003
But that means...

182
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,290
<i>And then, Marshall realized
what a jackass he had been to Robin.</i>

183
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:28,502
Exactly. Barney's dating again,
and he couldn't be happier.

184
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:29,795
I mean,

185
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:32,462
that guy has been active.

186
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:35,008
Sexually.

187
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:36,468
He's been...

188
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:41,298
You know?

189
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:42,995
It's like...

190
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,114
How could you let me do that?

191
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,993
You're supposed to stop me
from embarrassing myself in public.

192
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:04,019
I know,
but that song's kind of catchy.

193
00:10:12,242 --> 00:10:13,046
Damn it.

194
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:15,841
I've read that thing cover to cover,
and I can't find a loophole.

195
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:17,768
What am I going to do?

196
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,083
Well,
there is one other option, but...

197
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,930
you're not ready.

198
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,521
Tell me.

199
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,278
If you have to seal the deal
in one date,

200
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:28,353
it's got to be
one doozy of a date, right?

201
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:31,815
I'm not talking dinner and a movie.
I'm not talking mini-golf.

202
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,233
I'm talking...

203
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,224
17 dates worth of romance

204
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:38,030
wrapped up
into one incredible night.

205
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:40,157
I'm talking about...

206
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:41,617
a superdate.

207
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,251
A superdate?

208
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,081
That sounds kind of lame.
What if we call it a megadate?

209
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:50,278
If you want my help,
it's a superdate.

210
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:52,083
- All right.
- Leave it to me.

211
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:55,740
- I'll plan the whole thing.
- You're going to plan the whole thing?

212
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,850
I bet
it'll be all gooey and romantic.

213
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,468
Gooey and romantic?

214
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,476
Gooey and romantic?

215
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,824
<i>You don't have to take her... </i>

216
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,675
<i>To Paris or Peru.</i>

217
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,152
Ted, what are you doing?

218
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:15,888
<i>You just have to make her
understand...</i>

219
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,954
Ted, people are looking at us.

220
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,960
<i>What she means to you.</i>

221
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,419
God, really?
You're going to do this right now?

222
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:28,334
<i>On your superdate,</i>

223
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:31,461
<i>Troubles of the world</i>

224
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:35,109
<i>will simply have to wait.</i>

225
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,733
<i>For wonders and amazement</i>

226
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:42,307
<i>served upon a silver plate,</i>

227
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,362
<i>hurry up now, don't be late.</i>

228
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:50,226
<i>'Cause hand in hand
you'll find a land...</i>

229
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,259
<i>where paradise awaits.</i>

230
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,708
And then boom!

231
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,953
Fireworks
over the Manhattan skyline!

232
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:05,504
You kiss her.

233
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,946
<i>And that's your...</i>

234
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,706
<i>superdate.</i>

235
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,531
That sounds gooey and romantic.

236
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:30,975
- Strip club?
- Strip club.

237
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:34,478
<i>Finally,
the night of the big dates arrived.</i>

238
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,022
So, tonight's the big night.

239
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:39,109
Where's the D-bag taking you?
That's not a good nickname for Don.

240
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:42,320
- I'll think of a better one.
- You know, that, I just... I canceled.

241
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,366
What do you mean you...

242
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:49,369
- What's wrong?
- Robin canceled her date.

243
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:52,330
What? She was totally psyched for it
like an hour ago.

244
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,962
You look like the classiest,

245
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,338
most expensive prostitute ever.

246
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:01,715
Thank you.

247
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,968
I take it
you're excited to go out with Don?

248
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,804
You know what? I kinda am.
Don't tell Marshall.

249
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,629
I won't.
I bet you'll have a nice time tonight.

250
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:12,451
Not, however, a super time.

251
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:16,354
A super time will be had
by Barney on his date with Anita.

252
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,830
Carriage ride,

253
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:20,650
dinner at <i>Le Tombeur des Culottes</i>.

254
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,283
They're calling it a superdate,
so...

255
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,306
How could you do that?!

256
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:31,077
Robin just got over
her mourning period!

257
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,079
She seemed
so happy after the breakup.

258
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,602
So unobservant.

259
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:36,777
Such a guy.

260
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:38,835
She was obviously crushed.

261
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:41,064
Wait, but that would mean...

262
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:46,426
<i>And then I realized
what a jackass I'd been to Robin.</i>

263
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:49,471
Whatcha singing?

264
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,228
Just a ditty I wrote about girls
Barney's been banging lately.

265
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,439
- Well, count me in for a verse.
- Great.

266
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,945
God.
Where is she?

267
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,738
I think she's in the restroom.

268
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:11,910
Guys, I'm fine.

269
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:20,919
Dude.

270
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,861
Why would you do that?

271
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:25,136
Because I'm angry at you.

272
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:28,134
I'm angry at me.
I'm angry at Ted.

273
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,303
And frankly,
I'm still angry at the Empire.

274
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,514
Why are you angry at me?

275
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,019
Dude, you've been a real jerk
in front of Robin

276
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,893
while she's been have
her mourning period.

277
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,021
She hasn't been going through
any mourning period.

278
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:42,862
- So unobservant.
- Such a guy.

279
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:46,106
Barney, sit down,
you need to hear some stuff.

280
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,698
- What, is she upset or something?
- Of course she's upset.

281
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,867
Take a look at yourself,
you dumb slut.

282
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,954
<i>And then Aunt Lily told Barney
every excruciating detail</i>

283
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:57,998
<i>of what he hadn't been seeing.</i>

284
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,156
You should've seen this girl.

285
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:03,795
I'm leaving.

286
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:05,515
So...

287
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,540
we get up to my place...

288
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,594
I can't believe Robin's been upset.

289
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,513
I can't believe you threw up
in your Stormtrooper helmet.

290
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:50,155
I did something worse in it
after <i>The Phantom Menace</i> premiere.

291
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,641
So, she's been this way
ever since we broke up?

292
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,739
Actually, she was doing much better

293
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:59,943
until you decided to go
on this stupid superdate with Anita.

294
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,780
And now she's off,
sulking God knows where.

295
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:05,782
I know where.

296
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,419
Barney, what's up?

297
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:19,864
Thought you were going
on some big date.

298
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,965
Robin, I know you're upset.

299
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,068
What?

300
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,886
I have...
I've never been happier.

301
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:28,863
And this Anita sounds lovely.

302
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,736
I am so glad that you two just...

303
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:33,442
randomly happened
to find each other.

304
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,562
It just warms my frickin' heart.

305
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:46,167
So, you're not upset?

306
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,075
Of course I'm upset, Barney.

307
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:51,643
Don't you see how constantly
talking about your conquests

308
00:16:51,768 --> 00:16:54,206
makes me feel
like I'm just another number to you?

309
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:55,707
But you're not that.

310
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,370
You know,
and now you're taking Anita,

311
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:01,022
who you barely know,
on this amazing date,

312
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,548
when I never got treated that way.

313
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:05,472
It just...

314
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,629
it just sucks, that's all.
It just sucks.

315
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,424
I knew I was bad
at being a boyfriend,

316
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:22,984
but I had no idea I'd be so much worse
at being an ex-boyfriend.

317
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,245
I'm sorry.

318
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:30,659
What can I do?

319
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,659
Nothing.

320
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,497
You've already proven
I'm not important.

321
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,910
Stop that, I'm serious.

322
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,535
Ask me for anything.

323
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,338
- Don't sleep with Anita.
- Done.

324
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,737
Barney, of course
you're going to sleep with her.

325
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:48,469
Why else would you be taking her
on this superdate?

326
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:51,424
She's not going on the superdate,
Robin.

327
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:53,432
You are.

328
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:57,503
<i>Your Uncle Barney
finally gave Aunt Robin</i>

329
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:59,778
<i>the superdate she truly deserved.</i>

330
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,399
<i>With a guy she truly deserved.</i>

331
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:06,758
<i>Of course,
there was still one loose end.</i>

332
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:10,866
I meant to call you.

333
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:14,427
Well, I'm breaking all my rules
coming down here, but...

334
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,956
nobody stands me up like that.
So, are we going out or what?

335
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:20,426
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:22,697
I made a promise to a friend.

337
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,337
I have to say no.

338
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,970
I see.

339
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,470
You're trying the "no" thing on me.

340
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:33,638
You think that'll work?

341
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,052
'Cause it won't.

342
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,111
How about this.
I'll cut you a deal.

343
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,396
Maybe...

344
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,142
you might...

345
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:45,442
get lucky after the 12th date.

346
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:48,706
The 11th date.
Fifth date.

347
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:50,670
Tonight.
Tonight before dinner.

348
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:53,768
How about you?
You interested?

349
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:56,369
Come on, Barney.

350
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,887
I'm sorry, Anita.

351
00:18:58,518 --> 00:18:59,790
The answer is no.

352
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:01,769
Well, good.

353
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:04,085
Because my answer is no, too.

354
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,089
Here's my final offer.

355
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:40,163
And that's my story.

356
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:44,027
Well, here's a $500 ticket
for jumping in the river.

357
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,159
I hope it was worth it.

358
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,192
I hope so, too.

359
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,750
It's an old wives' tale.

360
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,963
How did the big date go?

361
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:30,726
Pretty well.

362
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,977
Pretty... pretty well.

363
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,012
Like how "pretty well"?

364
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:36,911
Guys, come on.

365
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,930
It was fine.

366
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,806
You know, it was nice.

367
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:43,082
We had a good time.

368
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,508
Let's just...

369
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:46,180
let's just leave it.

370
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:49,748
Although,

371
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,703
one interesting thing did happen.
