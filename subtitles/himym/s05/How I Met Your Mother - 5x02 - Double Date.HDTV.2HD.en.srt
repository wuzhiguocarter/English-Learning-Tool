00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,200
<i>NARRATOR: This is the story
of two blind dates.</i>

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:06,601
<i>One in 2009...</i>

3
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,868
<i>And one seven years earlier.</i>

4
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:11,367
<i>In all that time,
my dating routine</i>

5
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:13,934
<i>remained more or less
the same...</i>

6
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,133
<i>...until the fall of 2009,</i>

7
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,901
<i>when I finally had a date
that was different.</i>

8
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,033
<i>Because it was
exactly the same.</i>

9
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,901
<i>I was on a blind date
with the same woman</i>

10
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,501
<i>I went on a blind date with
seven years earlier.</i>

11
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:31,334
Ted?
Ted?

12
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:32,200
Jen?
Jen?

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,767
It's nice to meet you.

14
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,067
<i>And she didn't remember it.</i>

15
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>But then again...</i>

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,701
It's nice to meet you, too.

17
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>Neither did I.</i>

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Do you want to...?
Yeah.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,400

20
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,167
Guess who just got four tickets

21
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,167
<i>to the "Origins of Chewbacca"
Star Wars exhibit?</i>

22
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,834
Why?
No, I said, "Guess who?"

23
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,334
I heard you.

24
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:05,167
Yeah, um, isn't it a little early 
in our relationship

25
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,467
to do something that
would end our relationship?

26
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,968
What? No, what are
you talking about?

27
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,834
It can be our first
double date as couples!

28
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:12,934
And plus,
it sounds awesome!

29
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:14,801
Is the original Chewbacca
going to be there?

30
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:17,000
Peter Mayhew, in the fur.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,968
Who's with me?

32
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:20,167
Hey, do you think
they'll have

33
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,634
Wookiee to English
dictionaries there?

34
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:24,467
I mean, even just an everyday
phrase book would be helpful.

35
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:25,701
We're not going

36
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:28,334
to the "Origins of Chewbacca"
exhibit, Marshall.

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,367
It's in Houston this year.

38
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,400
Everyone knows that.

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,300
I just wanted to get
rid of the girls.

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,534
Where are you taking me, Barney?

41
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:39,334
<i>This wasn't the first time
your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.</i>

42
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:41,400
Wait a second.

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,601
The "Origins of Chewbacca"
exhibit's in Montreal this year.

44
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,467
Everyone knows that.

45
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:48,234
Where are you taking me?

46
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,934
My guy in the DA's office
scored us

47
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:52,467
front row seats
to a lethal injection.

48
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:54,734
But we're still stopping
for chili dogs first.

49
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,067
Stop the cab.

50
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:58,501
Where are you taking me?

51
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:01,367
(techno dance music playing)

52
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,501
Barney,
why are we here?

53
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,801
Marshall, now that
Robin and I are together,

54
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,667
I've learned a lot
about relationships

55
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,133
by watching you and Lily.

56
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,167
Thanks, man.

57
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,567
You're a terrible couple.

58
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:13,667
Lily has taken

59
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,901
all the man out of you.

60
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,501
I used to think that's just
every relationship.

61
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,767
But what I've got with Robin
proves that you can

62
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,934
have a girlfriend and fully
functioning male genitalia

63
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,334
all at the same time.

64
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,167
Okay, right.

65
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,534
So, if Robin knew
that you were here,

66
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,167
she would be completely
fine with it?

67
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,434
Are you kidding?

68
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:31,634
She'd sprint down here
with a purse full of singles

69
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:34,267
and a poncho
for the 10:30 Jell-O show.

70
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,667
BT-Dub, I called ahead--
it's lime.

71
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,868
<i>Meanwhile, Jen and I were at
my favorite</i>

72
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,200
<i>first date restaurant...</i>

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,667
<i>for the second time.</i>

74
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:43,901
So, Jen, what do you do?

75
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,834
I'm between jobs--
banking crisis.

76
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,033
I'm between jobs--
Internet bubble burst.

77
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,434
Makes me realize I should

78
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,133
go into something
more stable...

79
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,133
like banking.

80
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,501
So what about you?

81
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,868
I'm an architect.

82
00:02:57,868 --> 00:02:59,067
Hopefully, one day,

83
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,601
I can use my own humble brush

84
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:04,033
on the masterpiece that is
Manhattan's skyline.

85
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,133
I teach aritecture.

86
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,734
Get 50% off

87
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,467
Married!

88
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,934
What is wrong with you?

89
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:18,300
You're just looking.

90
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,667
It's like fantasizing
about other women.

91
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,901
It's harmless.

92
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,901
What.

93
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,434
Don't tell me you don't
fantasize about other women.

94
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,267
I do!

95
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,067
It's just not that easy.

96
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,334
False.

97
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:35,000
I once fantasized about
that silhouette chick

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,868
you see on a truck's mudflaps.

99
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,334
Took me less than a mile.

100
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,467
Not everyone is you,
okay, Barney?

101
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,901
Even when I do start to have
a dirty thought like that...

102
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,934
<i>it seems so much like cheating
on Lily, that I feel guilty</i>

103
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:51,033
<i>So first, I need to have
a different fantasy.</i>

104
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,167
(hiccups)

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,367
Bad news.

106
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:02,100
Lily has a rare and fatal
hiccup disorder

107
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,868
that's apparently
medical illegitimate.

108
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,033
What?! How could this be?!

109
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,567
Beats me, but it says it
right here

110
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,400
on this doctor clipboard
that doctors have.

111
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,167
It's time, baby.

112
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:28,067
I will never love again.

113
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,000
No, Marshall, you must.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,067
And after

115
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,067
an appropriate number of years,

116
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,901
you should
find someone else.

117
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,133
Someone like that

118
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:39,634
busty delivery girl
from that one time.

119
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:43,133
And plow her like a cornfield.

120
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,100
And so, Marshall,
to honor Lily,

121
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,000
you must find that busty
delivery girl from that one time

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,901
and plow her like a cornfield.

123
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:09,167
Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.

124
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,501
Where do I sign?

125
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:27,734
And then watch out,
because it is on!

126
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:32,000
That is the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,767
Dude, Lily gets you
in real life

128
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,000
She has no business
in your fantasies.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,033
It's all I know, okay?

130
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,501
I can't, I can't help it.

131
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:40,501
I accept your invitation.

132
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:41,567
Marshall Eriksen,

133
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,801
from this day forward,

134
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,200
I will be the wingman
of your mind.

135
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,934
Now, focus on the next dancer.

136
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,200
Put Lily completely
out of your mind.

137
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,267
Gentlemen,

138
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,133
say hello  J-J-J-Jasmine.

139
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,000
Barney?

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,400
Is it just me or does that
stripper look exactly like...?

141
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,934
Ted, we found a stripper who looks
exactly like Lily!

142
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,634
Yeah, I can't
talk right now.

143
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:11,033
I'm speechless, too.

144
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:13,267
Everything's as perky
as we've always imagined!

145
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:14,634
Stop looking at her.

146
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,901
Uh, look, I got to go.

147
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,234
Take a picture.

148
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:18,267
Oh, I will.

149
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:19,868
But first, I'm going to
make Marshall

150
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,567
watch as I wedge
Ulysses S. Grant

151
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,033
between his wife's tatas.

152
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,300
I'll kill you!

153
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,734
Sorry about that.

154
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,133
So, any thoughts on food?

155
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,534
Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?

156
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,734
I would love to share
the oysters.

157
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,868
Good. 'Cause if you didn't...

158
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:41,968
...that would be
mighty shellfish.

159
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,267
Wow, that's bad.

160
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,067
That's why it's funny!

161
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,268
We've been on this date before.

162
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:56,701
We've been on this

163
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,667
exact blind date before.

164
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,801
In this exact same restaurant.

165
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,867
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think
that blind date went too well.

166
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:06,868
Me neither.

167
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:09,400
I remember thinking
that you were a little snobby.

168
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,767
Wait, you...

169
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,067
You dress ur cats up
in weird costumes.

170
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,934
They're not weird.
See, you're being snobby again.

171
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,133
Oh, my God.

172
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,767
Do you realize what this means?

173
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:23,667
Since our first date,
we've done a complete lap

174
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,767
of all the single people
in New York

175
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,400
only to end up back here,
with each other.

176
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,267
Whoa.

177
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,467
We're going to die alone,
aren't we?

178
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,033
Well, you've got your cats.

179
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,834
(chuckles)

180
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:37,300
This is insane.

181
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,467
Wait, I got to ask.

182
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,067
Why did you think I was snobby?

183
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:43,567
Wait... Okay...
yeah, we were

184
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,100
sitting over there...

185
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,400
(laughs)

186
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,467
Main Lobster.

187
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,567
They spelled "Maine"
without the "e."

188
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,167
Good to know we're not
getting the crappy

189
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,934
understudy lobsters, right?

190
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:56,801
Tonight, the role of
pound-and-a-half lobster

191
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:57,801
will be played by...

192
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,000
I get it, Ted.

193
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:02,167
Pointing out
spelling errors in a menu

194
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,868
makes you seem kind of snooty.

195
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,534
Huh.

196
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:06,801
I had no idea.

197
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,367
Okay, well, what about me?

198
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,767
Aside from the cats,
how did I come across?

199
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,467
That's right-- the check.

200
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,567
The check came

201
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,601
and, of course,
I was going to pay,

202
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:19,067
but you didn't
do the check dance.

203
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:22,000
(lilting orchestral
melody plays)

204
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,200
Guys want to wave the girl off

205
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,834
and, you know,
look like a big shot.

206
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:44,467
Huh. I had no idea.

207
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,300
This is good.
We're learning stuff.

208
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,133
You know what we should do?

209
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,901
We should retrace
the rest of that night

210
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:52,601
and figure out what else
we do wrong on first dates.

211
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:56,534
'Cause let's be honest--
we are scaring people off, Jen.

212
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:58,601
We really are.

213
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,334
Okay, I'm in.

214
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,067
Great.
Where'd we go next?

215
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,400
I think we went to MacLaren's.
Okay.

216
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:12,734
Hey, I didn't really talk about
my cats that much, did I?

217
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,100
And then,

218
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,567
there's Tabby-gail Adams,
the jester of the group.

219
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,200
Tone down the kitty talk.

220
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,133
Check.

221
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,200
You will not believe
who we saw tonight.

222
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,067
Dude, um...

223
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,634
We saw the third
doppelganger!

224
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,968
(gasps)

225
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,501
<i>I should explain.</i>

226
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,667
<i>Over the years we had spotted
two strangers</i>

227
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,367
<i>who looked exactly like
members of our group.</i>

228
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:38,734
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

229
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,200
<i>Lesbian Robin.</i>

230
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,834
<i>And Moustache Marshall.</i>

231
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,067
<i>By the following summer,</i>

232
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,234
<i>we would find the remaining
two doppelgangers.</i>

233
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,400
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

234
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,667
Ladies, meet Stripper Lily.

235
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,601
Oh!
Okay.

236
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:01,067
Yeah, I couldn't get
her face in it.

237
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,567
But she looks
just like you.

238
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,400
So you went
to a strip club?

239
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,868
Busted.

240
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:08,434
And there was a stripper
who looked exactly like me?

241
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:10,868
Okay, babe, look,
before you get mad, let me...

242
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,601
Awesome!

243
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,968
I bet the guys were going crazy.

244
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:16,267
Oh, I bet they wanted
to touch her so bad.

245
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,634
But all you can do is look,
unless you go

246
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,501
into the back room, but honey,
you got to pay for that.

247
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,300
So...

248
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,033
Strip club.

249
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,200
Marshall made me go.

250
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,701
All right, so what did I do
wrong next?

251
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:34,434
Let me have it.
I'here to learn.

252
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,100
Well, I kept telling you I was cold,
but you didn't offer me your jacket.

253
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,267
It's a little brisk
out tonight, huh?

254
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,767
Not really.
Really?

255
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,901
I can't feel my fingers.

256
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,434
I'm pretty impervious
to stuff like that.

257
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,767
I couldn't
admit I was cold.

258
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,467
I didn't want
to seem like a wimp

259
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,300
compared to your
action hero ex-boyfriend

260
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,234
who you wouldn't
stop talking about.

261
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:55,601
After a day
of fighting fires,

262
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,534
Jim would love
to come home and unwind

263
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:59,634
working on his
'68 Camo.

264
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:00,934
That or bare-knuck boxing,

265
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:03,667
which he learned
in the Marine Corps.

266
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,501
I had an aunt
in the Coast Guard.

267
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:09,801
Okay, so no talking
about the ex.

268
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,868
Not even about his
shockingly small wiener?

269
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:16,868
See? Why didn't you
lead off with that?

270
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,434
Was there
a shower on stage?

271
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,000
Sometimes there's
a shower on stage.

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,634
I bet stripper me
would get in there

273
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:26,167
with another girl
and just go bananas.

274
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,467
See, Marshall?

275
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,067
We got to have a bros'
night at a strip club

276
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,200
and both of our ladies
are totally cool with it.

277
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,434
I'm not cool with it.

278
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,367
Because they understand
that it's healthy for us

279
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:36,968
to do that
from time to time.

280
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:38,100
It's disgusting.

281
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,334
Because it's harmless.

282
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:41,067
Did one of your
whores tell you that?

283
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,868
And, Lil, Marshall shouldn't have to go
to so much trouble

284
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:46,667
just to have
an innocent fantasy.

285
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,100
Trouble?
What trouble?

286
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,601
It's, no, it's nothing.

287
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,033
Marshall, tell her.
We're all friends here.

288
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:56,467
No, we're not.

289
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,534
Sometimes I think about
other women.

290
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:00,667
Okay, it happens

291
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,000
But even when I do,
I feel so guilty

292
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,033
that I-I have to imagine you...
passing away first,

293
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,801
You're... you're
just my life, baby.

294
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,767
And I love you.

295
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,868
You kill me first?!

296
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:20,834
I mean, fantasize about
other girls all you want,

297
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,868
but could you maybe
not murder me?!

298
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:23,634
Murder?!

299
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:24,801
No! I, baby-no.

300
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,067
You develop
a chronic illness!

301
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:29,367
I spare no expense
for your care!

302
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,200
We're, like, this close
to a cure.

303
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,701
Remember?

304
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,234
Oh, yeah!

305
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,467
I do remember.

306
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,133
We went in here for a drink
with your friends.

307
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,000
Who I loved...
Or hated,

308
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,634
depending on whether you're
still friends with them.

309
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,968
You loved them.
They're family, Ted.

310
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:45,667
Let's go in and see
what they remember.

311
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,033
And they are my best friends,

312
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,934
so don't be surprised if they
suddenly "can't think"of

313
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,801
anything I do wrong.

314
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:53,567
Did he juggle?
Bad puns?
Mmm.

315
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:57,067
Expect a standing ovation
for picking up a $19 check

316
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,100
Oh, let's not forget
the menu typo gold mine.

317
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,634
Keep pannin'
that river, buddy.

318
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,868
Well, it is a lot cheaper
than buying a coom.

319
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,934
Oh!

320
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:07,767
Actually you know
what it was?

321
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,601
I remember him coming across
as kind of a player.

322
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,067
Me?
Ted? Ted?

323
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,267
Yeah.

324
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,133
We were all sitting
over there...

325
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,734
And here's a picture of my cats
dressed up like Batman villains.

326
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,901
You got the Joker,
the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...

327
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,100
Wh about Cat Woman?

328
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,501
Yeah, that would've been good.

329
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,501
Psst! Ted!

330
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,734
Nice.

331
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:39,234
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!
I member that.

332
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,734
Psst, Ted.

333
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,968
Nice.

334
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,868
We were checking out
Moustache Marshall.

335
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:52,467
Ah.
Ah.

336
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,601
Gosh, I thought you
were such a jerk.

337
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,801
I'm so sorry.

338
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,601
Yeah, well,
it's nice to know

339
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,701
"past me" wasn't
a total jackass, huh?

340
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:02,767
"Present you"
isn't so bad, either.

341
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:07,267
Thank you very much.
You got it.

342
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:08,868
Yes.

343
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:11,801
Oh, yeah!

344
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,467
I remember this.

345
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,400
...and there's the
Chrysler Building.

346
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,234
And the Empire
State Building.

347
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:22,234
And at 12:00,
a rotund couple

348
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:24,000
going at it
against the glass.

349
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,334
Aww...

350
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,300
That's kind of sweet.

351
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,534
Oh, look.

352
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,701
Snack break.

353
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,801
Good for them.

354
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:35,701
Letting a guy eat pizza
off your back, that's love.

355
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,467
So, um...

356
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:43,567
I know this wasn't the best
first date of all time,

357
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:46,200
but, uh, I'm glad we
stuck it out.

358
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,801
Me, too.

359
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,200
That was really great.

360
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,901
Wh... What went wrong?

361
00:14:57,901 --> 00:15:00,234
I remember now.

362
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,400
Wow.

363
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,834
Yeah.

364
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,767
So would you
maybe, um...

365
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,367
want to go out again?

366
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,434
Yeah, I, I would.

367
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:13,501
Will you call me?

368
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:14,701
Absolutely.

369
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:15,934
Promise?

370
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:17,834
Promise.

371
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:24,567
I have been so busy.

372
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:25,868
Good night, Ted.

373
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,450
Hello?

374
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,784
Jen, I sorry.

375
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:38,450
Look, I know I'm seven years
late with this call,

376
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,951
but I was an idiot
back then.

377
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,517
You saw the goatee.

378
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:43,851
The truth is,

379
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,051
I had a great time tonight,

380
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:46,717
and I'd love
to see you again.

381
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:49,517
Ted, there are
two kinds of guys.

382
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,650
The guys that you want
to call you, who don't;

383
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,350
and the guys you don't want
to call you, who always do.

384
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,017
And somehow,
right now, you're both.

385
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:01,151
Baby...

386
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:04,051
You should be able to fantasize 
about another woman

387
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:07,550
without feeling guilty,

388
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,884
I wish that I could,

389
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,951
but I've been doing
this for so long,

390
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:13,450
I'm all confused
about death and sex.

391
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,483
It's gotten to
the pot where

392
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:15,951
every time I drive
past a cemetery,

393
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,517
I'm sportin' a partial.

394
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,750
All right,
we got to fix this.

395
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,650
Okay, when

396
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,884
Stripper Lily gets out here,

397
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,584
you have my permission
to fantasize about her.

398
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,550
And since she's
basically me,

399
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,017
maybe you won't feel guilty.

400
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:32,483
Thanks, baby.
I'm-I'm so lucky I have you.

401
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,851
And stripper you.

402
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,383
Bring out Stripper Lily!

403
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:42,417
You know, I don't
come here that much.

404
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:43,917
Hey, Barney.

405
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,684
He's the usual
and I'll send over

406
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,684
the other usual as soon
as she's done stretching.

407
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:48,684
Hmm...

408
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:51,884
Thank you, kindly stranger.

409
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,784
Ladies and gentlemen...

410
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,884
Oh, hey, Barney.

411
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:56,017
Didn't see you come in.

412
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,383
I'll load up some
AC/DC for you, buddy.

413
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,218
Ladies and gentlemen, please

414
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:02,750
put your hands together
for Jasmine.

415
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:09,984
I am hot!

416
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:13,617
Ye.
Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.

417
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:14,884
I is awesome.

418
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:16,151
Baby, can I get another hundred?

419
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,251
That was a hundred?

420
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,417
Wow, she crawls fast.

421
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:22,483
Look, Jen,
I wish I could

422
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:25,318
go back and talk some sense
into 2002 Ted,

423
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,251
but that guy's
a lost cause.

424
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,483
He's 24.

425
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,017
He thinks a little facial hair
makes him look like John Depp.

426
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,184
And he has no idea

427
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:35,184
what a great girl
he's missing out on.

428
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,851
But I've learned a lot
since then.

429
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,817
I've learned a lot tonight.

430
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:41,917
The only thing that we've learned
is that, seven years ago,

431
00:17:41,917 --> 00:17:43,784
it was mistake
for us to go out.

432
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:46,517
And I guess it was a mistake
for us to go out tonight.

433
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:47,884
No, it wasn't.

434
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,517
I had a great time tonight.

435
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:51,917
And seven years ago,
if you think about it,

436
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,450
we didn't miss by that much.

437
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,550
If a couple things

438
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,251
had gone a little bit
differently...

439
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:59,417
who knows what
would have happened?

440
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,650
Wow.

441
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,218
Wow.

442
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,151
You are the best.

443
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:49,151
My girlfriend is
at a strip club with me

444
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,218
and she couldn't care less.

445
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:51,784
I do care, Barney.

446
00:18:51,784 --> 00:18:54,550
Look, we're dating now, okay?
That changes things.

447
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,517
We have to have a serious
talk about this.

448
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,417
Just the best.
Hey.

449
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,184
Girlfriend trouble?

450
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,584
I wish I could help,
but my unbelievably cool wife

451
00:19:02,584 --> 00:19:05,251
just bought us a private dance
with her stripper body double.

452
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,584
So if you need me,
I'll be getting grinded

453
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,517
like some pepper,
in the Champagne room.

454
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,051
Just the best.

455
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:20,151
... now what?

456
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:22,318
I just remembered
why I didn't call you.

457
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:23,450
Why?

458
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,851
I can't believe I'm gonna

459
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:27,284
screw this up again, but, um...

460
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:30,584
I like finding typos in menus.

461
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:31,750
What?

462
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,617
And I know my shellfish pun is stupid

463
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:34,917
but the truth ...

464
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,584
I'm not suddenly gonna stop
making stupid jokes.

465
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:40,417
Now that you mention it...

466
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:43,350
I'm never going to stop
talking about my cats.

467
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,417
They're funny and adorable

468
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,350
and totally worth having
to take six Benadryl a day.

469
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,884
Shouldn't we hold out

470
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:56,184
for the person who doesn't just
tolerate our little quirks,

471
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:58,117
but actually kind of likes them?

472
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,784
Even if it means
finding ourselves

473
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,784
on another blind date with each
other, seven years from now?

474
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:06,584
Oh, dear God,
I hope that don't happen.

475
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,284
Well... good luck
out there, Jen.

476
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:16,784
You too, Ted.

477
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,251
You'll find your shellfish lady.

478
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:27,917
<i>And kids, when I told your
mother that shellfish joke,</i>

479
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,284
<i>she did laugh.</i>

480
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:32,184
And I swear, it was only,
like, 30% pity.

481
00:20:39,018 --> 00:20:40,217
Hey, Lil.

482
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,217
Looks like, uh, Jasmine's
having a hard time

483
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:43,617
getting out of those boots.

484
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,484
What did you say, buddy?

485
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,217
Lily?

486
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:50,217
Who?

487
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:53,684
Oh, yes... I am this Lily.

488
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,450
We married long time.

489
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,118
May I have monies for shopping?

490
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:01,084
Lily!
