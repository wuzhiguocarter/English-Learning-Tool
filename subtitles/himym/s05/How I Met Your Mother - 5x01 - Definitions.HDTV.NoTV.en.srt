<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, on my first day
as a college professor,</i>

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,100
<i>there re two things
I didn't know</i>

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,033
<i>that I wish did.</i>

4
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:16,901
<i>The first thing was that your
mother was in that classroom.</i>

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,300
The second thing?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,701
<i>Well, to explain tt,
we have to go back</i>

7
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:25,033
<i>to the beginning of the summer,</i>

8
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,534
<i>when, after a year of wrestling</i>

9
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,033
<i>with their feelings
for each other,</i>

10
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:32,033
<i>Barney and Robin
finally, well...</i>

11
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,367
Whoo!
Lily, volume.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,534
Use your indoor "whoo."

13
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:36,868
Sorry, whoo!

14
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,200
It's jt they kissed!

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,834
They're finally a couple.

16
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,334
(gasps)
Oh, my God, you guys!

17
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:44,200
This is our first double date!

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,300
First of millions!

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,767
What if our kids
get married?!

20
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, I love this!

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,901
Yeah... Lily, listen.

22
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,968
Barney's awesome.

23
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:56,400
Ron's more than
just awe-"some."

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,033
She's awe-"quite a bit."

25
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,467
She's awe-"a whole darn lot."

26
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,000
Wait, what are you saying?

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,834
We're just not
feeling it right now.

28
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,567
But we'll totally
still be friends.
Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:10,367
Is it something I did?

30
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh, no, no, no,
no, God, no.
No, no, no.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,567
Uh-uh.
Lily, it's not you.

32
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:14,801
It'ss.
Yeah.

33
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:15,934
It's us.

34
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,101
You understand, right?

35
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,168
Sure, of course.

36
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,834
As long as you're happy,
I'm happy.

37
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,600
(sobbing)

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,700
We were gonna take 
cooking lessons together

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,367
and we were gonna go
on camping trips together

40
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:32,901
and then we were gonna sit
around telling funny stories

41
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:36,201
about our cooking lessons
and our camping trips.

42
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,967
I know, I know.

43
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:41,201
(sobbing

44
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,367
So, has the boat sailed
onex tonight or...

45
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,634
<i>After that, the summer
went by way too fast.</i>

46
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,300
<i>Until all of a sudden,
it was the Friday</i>

47
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,333
<i>before my firsday
as a college professor.</i>

48
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,834
Whoa, what's this?
Oh, boy.

49
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:58,467
It's just a little something
that we got for you

50
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:02,567
that used to belong to my
favorite professor of all time.

51
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:07,034
A fedora.

52
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,101
I'm Indiana Jones!

53
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm Indiana Jones!

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,500
That, my friend,
is the Dominator 8000,

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,300
the best bullwhip on the market,
according to my whip guy.

56
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:23,467
Yeah, I have a whip guy.

57
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,034
You know what we should do?
We should...

58
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,101
Finish ourd rinks, go out
in the alley, and whip stuff.

59
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:30,767
God, you just get me.

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,734
Okay, I should get going.
I got a date.

61
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,433
Oh, are you still
seeing that guy?

62
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:36,500
Uh, even better,
seeing him naked.

63
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,867
What!
Oh!

64
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,134
I should go, too.

65
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:41,333
I hooked up with this
Chinese girl last night,

66
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:45,234
and I don't know, it's weird.
I already feel like seconds.

67
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, Ted, you got first whip!

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,034
All right.

69
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:53,000
(imitating Clint Eastwood)
Hey, dummy.

70
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,567
What did tell you
about smoking in here?

71
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:57,701
Make him whip the habit!

72
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,034
I'so excited
about this whip!

73
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:00,501
I got whip fever!

74
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,534
Just whip him, Ted!

75
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,567
Don't even aim!

76
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:03,534
Just whip him!

77
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:04,833
I am so sorry.

78
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,200
No, it's just the whip's
not a toy, Ted.

79
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,833
There's such a thing
as common sense, you know.

80
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,800
Hey, you can whip me
if you want.

81
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,301
I will, some other time.

82
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,634

87
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,233
(sighs)
All summer.

88
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,367
I knew it!

89
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,634
I knew it! I knew it!

90
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,367
<i>You guys are boyfriend
and girlfriend.</i>

91
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:44,534
Whoa, hey.
Whoa.

92
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,100
Wow, no.
Whoa...

93
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,367
Whoa, whoa, whoaLily.
Girlfriend?

94
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,834
Slow your roll
there, Lilypad.
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,434
You've been together all summer.
I dot get it.

96
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,500
Okay, it's like this.

97
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,100
After we kissed,
we sat down to have the talk.

98
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,133
We should figure out
what this is.

99
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,400
Yes, we should.

100
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,500
Or.

101
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,334
Or...

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,734
<i>Okay, now, we have
to figure this out.</i>

103
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,467
Yes, we do.

104
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,334
Or. Or...

105
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,167
Whoa!

106
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,934
We kept trying to have the talk

107
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,867
and then we realized
we hate the talk.

108
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,467
Yeah, the talk sucks.

109
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,534
You have to, like, talk.
(groans)

110
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,267
And be all,
"I don't know.

111
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,701
"It's not that
I don't like you.

112
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,200
"It'sust that I haven't
had a girlfriend

113
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,300
"in a really ng time.

114
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,701
I hope it doesn't
make you mad."

115
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:33,267
(groans)
Who needs it?

116
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,701
You needs it.

117
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:35,801
Guys, you can't

118
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,034
just keep hooking up

119
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:38,701
and not at least
try and fire out

120
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:39,901
what you mean to each other.

121
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,767
Yeah, we knew
you would say that.

122
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,167
That's why we
kept it a secret.

123
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,534
We, that and the fact

124
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,267
that elaborate lies
really turn us on.

125
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,200
No, no, no. No.

126
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,068
You need tdefine
the relationship.

127
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,667
You ne to have
the talk.

128
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,167
Or. Or..

129
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,801
(Robin and Barney moaning)

130
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:00,901
I know what you're all thinking.

131
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,101
"Who's this cool peer of mine
up in front  the class?"

132
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,534
Well, I know the board says

133
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:09,767
"Professor Mosby,"
but to you

134
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,500
I'm Ted, huh?

135
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:15,333
Question. Awesome.

136
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,200
Hit it.
Yeah, here's my question.

137
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,400
"Ted," who the hell
do you think you are?

138
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,333
Yeah, "Ted."

139
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,967
We're supposed to learn
from you?

140
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:25,567
You failed as an architect.

141
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:26,600
Well...

142
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,534
And if you're a professor,

143
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:28,901
where's your h
and your whip?

144
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,367
They're at home.
I didn't think I'd need...

145
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:31,834
And where are your pants?

146
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,367
(laughter)

147
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,767
Oh! (gasps

148
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:37,867
Oh, God.

149
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,967
Barney, it was awful.
I was teaching...

150
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,567
Shh, Ted, now's
not a good time.

151
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,734
Whe do you keep
your condoms?

152
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,600
Okay, look, mistake #1

153
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,400
was taking that
girl's question.

154
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,333
You don't take questions
on the first day.

155
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,367
It shows weakness.

156
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:55,933
Mistake #2

157
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,467
was you should've hit that.

158
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,167
Dude, your pants
were already off,

159
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,967
u had a classroom full
of people to cheer you on,

160
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,301
and you n't knock her up
'cause it's a dream.

161
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:05,768
Class dismissed.

162
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:08,067
Mistake #3:
dude, where was the hat?

163
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,434
Because if y're
not going to wear it,
I'm taking it back.

164
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:12,501
I think what Barney's
saying is that

165
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,000
definitions are important.

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're their teacher,
not their friend.

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,601
Exactly.

168
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:19,602
If people don't know their place,

169
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:19,668
nobody's happy.

170
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:21,200
Amen.

171
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,734
You have to make things clear.

172
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:23,800
Run tell dat.

173
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,967
Define the relationship.

174
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,534
Yes! No!

175
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,334
Lily, private convo time.

176
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,833
Lily, can't you just
let us be happy?

177
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,234
You're not happy.

178
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:39,668
You just think you're happy
because you feel happy.

179
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,534
And that's not happy?

180
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,534
Of course not.

181
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,567
You and Robin need
to have the talk.

182
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,267
Why? Give me one good reason.
I'll give you 20...

183
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:49,167
Wow, you can't even
think of one.

184
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,467
Headlights. Deer.

185
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,800
Lily, for the last time,

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,134
things with me and Robin are
as good as they can possibly be.

187
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:57,501
Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.

188
00:06:58,634 --> 00:06:59,734
I've got two tickets

189
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,467
to the Rangers/Canucksame
tomorrow night.

190
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:04,000
I know you're a hockey fan,
so I was tnking...

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,668
Uh, oh, um...

192
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:06,933
Uh...

193
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,134
What do I have to do?

194
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:09,534
Put a gun to your head?

195
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:12,501
Buy you a six pack?

196
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,833
Oh, come on, Brad, that's...

197
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,034
Wow, there's really
six of them.

198
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,734
Uh, t, uh, I can't.

199
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,467
Why not?
You have a boyfriend?

200
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,501
No. No, no boyfriend.

201
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,434
Great! It's a date.

202
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:27,900
Hey, Barn.
Hey, Brad...

203
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:38,401
<i>Eventually, Robin and Brad
went to a hockey game.</i>

204
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,634
You're probably wondering
why I've been quiet all night.

205
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,367
Um...

206
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:44,401
Damn it, Hordichuk!

207
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,701
You miss another gimme
like that,

208
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:46,933
I'm gonna come down there

209
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,234
and put a slapper right up
ur beerhole! Come on!

210
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:51,567
Not really.

211
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,334
The truth is,

212
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:55,634
I-I feel kind of weird
being out with you.

213
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:57,200
Oh, man.

214
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,467
Is this the talk?

215
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:00,267
What?
No, this is good.

216
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:01,867
Let's get it all
out of the way.

217
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,267
Robin, I'm looking
for something serious.

218
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,967
No, Brad, no, it's...

219
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,768
But before we go any further,
you should know something

220
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:10,034
about my stuff
below the belt.

221
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,900
I was born
a little different.

222
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,367
God, no, uh,

223
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,833
Brad, no, um...

224
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,668
This iabout
me and Barney.
You and Barn...

225
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:19,800
Oh, oh, so you,
you guys are...

226
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,367
Well, we-we-we don't
know what we are.

227
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,200
I mean, my heart says
"leap into it."

228
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,534
My brain says
"it's a bad idea."

229
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,501
Sounds like you guys
need to have the talk.

230
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,301
We're not gonna have the talk!

231
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,768
Would you just
have the talk, okay?

232
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,334
It's a five-minute conversation,

233
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,067
and then you get
to have sex afterwards.

234
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,933
It's great! Back me up, Ted.

235
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,067
I don't think
the talk is necessary.

236
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,267
What?!
Thank you, Ted.

237
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,567
Because Robin is already
his girlfriend.

238
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,867
What?!

239
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,601
MacLaren's Bar,
four years ago...

240
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:51,034
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend

241
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,600
Simple: the rules for girls

242
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,134
are the same as the rulesfor gremlin

243
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,534
"Gremlins"?

244
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,234
Gremlins. Rule #1:

245
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,067
never get them wet.

246
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,501
In other words, don't let her
take a shower at your place.

247
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,034
#2: keep them away
from sunlight--

248
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,700
<i>i.e. don't ever see them
during the day.</i>

249
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,501
And rule #
never feed them after midnight.

250
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:11,134
Meaning she doesn't sleep over

251
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,967
<i>and you don't have breakfast
with her ever.</i>

252
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,468
What about brunch?
Is brunch cool?

253
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,733
No, Ted.
unch is not cool.

254
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,301
Ok, new topic.

255
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,534
How do I pick a tie?

256
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:27,067
<i>Simple: remember
in the movie Predator...</i>

257
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,834
I've done all three
of those things with Robin.

258
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,700
Is she my girlfriend?

259
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:38,967
Just once, I wish you guys
would call me on Tuxedo Night.

260
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,534
ANNOUNCER (over intercom):
Ladies and gentlemen,
time to pucker up

261
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:45,534
for the New York Rangers
Kiss Cam!

262
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:48,733
CROWD (chanting):
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

263
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:49,967
Okayhow about this?

264
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:51,834
If you kiss me and you
feel bad about it,

265
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,067
you're meant
to be with Barney.

266
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,201
Why not? Lay it on me.

267
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:57,733
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

268
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,568
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

269
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:02,267
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

270
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,568
Hey, Bd.

271
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,401
Brad, we can't fight
like this all night!

272
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:10,234
We both got some good shots in.
Let's call a truce!

273
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,834
It's oy, dude.

274
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,667
I shouldn't go kissing
some other guy's girlfriend.

275
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,201
(laughing)
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, girlfriend?

276
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,334
He come on.

277
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,633
That's putting it
a bit strongly.

278
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,534
A bit strongly.She's no
Okay, yeah.

279
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,633
A gifriend's
a bit much, Brad, okay?

280
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,800
(both laughing)

281
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,301
Okay, seriously.

282
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:29,167
We're at the point
of physical violence.

283
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,501
Now, will you ease
have the talk?

284
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:32,900
<i>Because of that?</i>

285
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,667
Come on. That's  thing.

286
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,568
I'm always punching guys.
Mm-hmm.

287
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,334
Girls-- I'll punch a baby.
I don't care.

288
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,401
<i>Finally, my first clas
had arrived.</i>

289
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,700
<i>For real this time.</i>

290
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,401
<i>I knew I had to make
a strong impression.</i>

291
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,034
<i>I had thought of everything.</i>

292
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,834
<i>Except...</i>

293
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,967
<i>Wait. Does professor
have one "F" or two?</i>

294
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,867
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

295
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,167
<i>Professor.</i>

296
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,534
<i>Pro-fess-or.</i>

297
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,101
<i>They're all staring at me.</i>

298
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:00,568
<i>Professor.
Uh, I don't know.</i>

299
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:03,034
<i>Ju do something!</i>

300
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:05,201
<i>Two "F's."
That looks right.</i>

301
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,667
<i>I think that's right.</i>

302
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:26,067
Hey, sorry I went little
too far last night.

303
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,367
Oh, look, we've been over this.

304
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,234
Unless I say "flugelhorn,"
you haven't gone too far.

305
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:32,434
No, meant punching Brad.

306
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:34,367
Oh, right. Look,
don't even worry about it.

307
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,234
It's... oh. God.

308
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:37,800
The doorknob's broken off.

309
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,434
We're locked in here.

310
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,434
Did, did you do this?
No.

311
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,667
Flugelhorn.
Did you do this?

312
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,834
No.

313
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:49,000
Ted? Ted, are you out there?

314
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,034
Ted's not here, Robin.

315
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:52,800
Lily, let us out of here.

316
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,167
I'd be glad to.

317
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:57,167
Just as soon as you
and Barney have the talk.

318
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,900
Lily! Come on.
Let us out!

319
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,501
No. Sit down,

320
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:06,633
define the relationship,
write down

321
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,534
that definition
on a piece of paper,

322
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,900
slip it under the door,

323
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,501
and if I like what I read,
you can go.

324
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:14,600
We are not
having the talk!

325
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,633
Then you'll die in there.

326
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,167
You're gonna
lock us in here?

327
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,334
Well, guess what?

328
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:20,733
Maybe we'll spend
the whole day having sex!

329
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,401
Well, guess what?

330
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:25,334
I brought Marshall with me,
so maybe we'll do the same.

331
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,468
Hey, guys.

332
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,600
<i>NARRATOR:
I still hadn't decided</i>

333
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,567
<i>what kind of professor
I wanted to be--</i>

334
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,867
<i>authoritative or cool guy.</i>

335
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:39,234
<i>I thought I would decide
in the moment.</i>

336
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,235
And I did. About 20 times.

337
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:41,500
Good morning.

338
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,834
'Sup, dudes?

339
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,901
Silence!

340
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:47,834
This is Architecture 101.

341
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,634
I am Professor Mosby.

342
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,333
But you can call me Ted.

343
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,300
Professor Mosby.

344
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,500
T-Dawg.

345
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,634
Do not call me T-Dawg.

346
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,467
Ner take questions
on the first day.

347
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,901
It shows weakness.

348
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:08,234
Also,

349
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:11,201
don't look right here.

350
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,400
(Barney chuckles)

351
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,534
Okay, good luck. Byesies.

352
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,467
<i>NARRATOR:

00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,067
<i>I had to decide.</i>

355
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,934
Please save all your qstions
until the end of the lecture.

356
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:28,367
(in high-pitched voice):
Thank you!

357
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,467
Now...

358
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:31,201
<i>NARRATOR:
Professor Mosby d arrived.</i>

359
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,634
<i>Of course, if I had taken
that girl's question--</i>

360
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,734
<i>who, by the way,was not your mo</i>

361
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,333
<i>Your mom was sitting...</i>

362
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,367
<i>Wait, let me finish this story
al quick.</i>

363
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>Here's what
that girl wod have said.</i>

364
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,901
I'm sorry to bother you,Professor Mo

365
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,600
but this isn't Architecture 101.

366
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,333
This is Economics 305.

367
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,134
You're in the wrong classroom.

368
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,101
<i>NARRATOR:
Yes, I was
in the wrong classroom.</i>

369
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:53,367
<i>And thus began</i>

370
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,367
<i>the most humiliating
seven minutes of my life.</i>

371
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,600
Here's your ink-about-it
for the day.

372
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,134
Every single person
in this room

373
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:02,801
is already an architect.

374
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,834
Architect?

375
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,168
Hmm. Ooh.

376
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:12,001
"We're just hanging out."

377
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,567
Just hanging out?

378
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,500
Not good enough.

379
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,934
Not good enough!

380
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:26,234
Can anyone here tell me what
this class is really all about?

381
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,801
Economics?

382
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,433
(laughter)

383
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,667
No. No, no. Don't laugh.

384
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,101
He's not...
He's not entirely wrong.

385
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:35,767
An architect must be economical

386
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,801
in his use of space,

387
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:40,600
so, well done.

388
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,534
<i>Looks like somone's building</i>

389
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,600
towards an A, huh?

390
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:49,867
"We're seeing
where things are going."

391
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,134
(laughs)

392
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:54,101
<i>I'll tell you
where things aren't going--</i>

393
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,600
out of that bedroom.

394
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,001
Not good enough.

395
00:14:57,001 --> 00:15:00,300
Not good eugh!

396
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,001
You--

397
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,700
why do you want
to be an architect?

398
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,300
I don't want to be an architect.

399
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,034
Yes. Yes, exactly.

400
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,134
It-It's not something

401
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:11,333
<i>you want to be.</i>

402
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,034
<i>It's something you need to be.</i>

403
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:14,600
You dot have a choice, right?

404
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,234
None of you has a choice

405
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:19,500
No questions!

406
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,234
"We're Barnman and Robin."

407
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,600
(laughs)

408
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,634
Oh, come on, you got to admit,
that's kind of funny, Lily.

409
00:15:27,634 --> 00:15:29,934
Not good enough.

410
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:32,767
(shouting):
Not good enough!

411
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,034
So if any of you

412
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,300
have even
the slightest inclination

413
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,567
to do anything with your life
other than become an architect,

414
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,168
you're wasting my time
and yours.

415
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:44,567
There's the door

416
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,168
You can go.

417
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,467
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

418
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,168
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't-Don't all leave!

419
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:58,034
Architecture's
fun! Look!

420
00:15:58,034 --> 00:15:59,268
I brought a hacky sack!

421
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:00,534
MAN:
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

422
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:02,134
My name is Professor Calzonetti.

423
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:03,667
This is Economics 305.

424
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,201
You may return to your seats.

425
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:06,500
(Ted laughs)

426
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,700
Uh, sorry, sir.

427
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,734
This is, uh, Architecture 101.

428
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:11,867
Who invited their dad, right?

429
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,567
CALZONETTI:
Young man,

430
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,834
for the last 28 years,

431
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,967
Economics 305 has been taught
right here

432
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,634
in building 14, room 7.

433
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,001
Uh, yeah.

434
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:23,234
Buddy, I'm sure
200 architecture students

435
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:26,034
and their professor
all got the room wrong.

436
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:27,867
T-Dawg,
you're in the wrong room, bro.

437
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:30,101
(laughter)

438
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,700
Sorry. Coming through.

439
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,567
Excuse me. Whoa.

440
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,667
20 minutes late
on your first day?

441
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,300
That's rough.
MARSHALL:
Mm.

442
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,867
Yeah, but here's
the funny thing.

443
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:55,567
<i>By that point,
I didn't have time</i>

444
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:58,101
<i>to think about what kind
of teacher I was going to be.</i>

445
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,400
<i>I just got up there
and talked about architecture.</i>

446
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,634
And it was kind of great.

447
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:04,268
That's awesome, Ted.
MARSHALL:
Yeah.

448
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,333
Congratulations, buddy.

449
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,134
Thanks.

450
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:07,300
ROBIN:
Nice job, Ted.

451
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,634
BAEY:
Hey, Ted, door five!

452
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,734
(thump)

453
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:11,634
Were you there?
Yeah, I got you,
buddy.

454
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,867
They still haven't
had the talk, huh?

455
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,700
I think I know
how to speed things up

456
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,067
(sighs)

457
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,500
(sniffing)

458
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,567
Oh, not cool!

459
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:28,168
Pancakes, fresh bacon.

460
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:31,400
It is so yummy.

461
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,834
Uh, dude,
I'm starving. Let's...

462
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,567
Let's just have the stupid talk.

463
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,001
Come on.
Fine.

464
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,567
But

465
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,101
how do these this even work?

466
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,201
What do we say?

467
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,367
(Lily clears throat loudly)

468
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:48,168
Huh.

469
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,169
Where do you see this relationship going?

470
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,467
Oh, my God,
that sounds so cheesy.

471
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,734
(laughin
I know, right?

472
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,901
Totally. But, um,

473
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:58,433
<i>where-where do you see
this relationship going?</i>

474
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,901
I don't know.

475
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,567
I mean,

476
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,201
it's not like I don't like you.

477
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:06,567
I just haven't had a girlfriend
for a long time.

478
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,367
I hope
that doesn't make you mad.

479
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,700
Mad?

480
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,901
I feel the same way.

481
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,201
I suck at relationshs.

482
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:12,967
I mean,

483
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,433
except with Ted.

484
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,400
Man, he really got it right.

485
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,767
I know it's a cliche

486
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:22,134
but he really ruined me
for other men.

487
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,668
<i>NARRATOR:
Of course, I wasn't in the room
for this conversation,</i>

488
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,134
<i>but I have to imagine
Robin said something like that.</i>

489
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:28,267
BARNEY:
Hmm.

490
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,933
Maybe we should go back
to being jt friends.

491
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,401
Maybe.

492
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:34,634
But, um,

493
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,501
I don't want
to stop having sex.

494
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh, good. Me, neither.

495
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah. Friends
isn't gonna work.

496
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,467
Nope. Oh, we're not good
at being friends.

497
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:44,100
We're nogood at being
in a relationship.

498
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,267
Wh are we good at?

499
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:47,501
I know something we're good at.

500
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,800
I don't know. If we're
gonna do it again,

501
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,900
I'm gonna need
some Gatorade, or...

502
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,034
No! No, t that.

503
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,601
(quietly):
Lying. Okay, think about it.

504
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:56,167
We spent the whole summer lying
about being just friends.

505
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,601
Why not just keep lying?

506
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
Really?ROBIN:
Yeah.

507
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,034
Really. We sat down.
We had the talk.

508
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:11,567
Barney's my boyfriend now.

509
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,900
And Robin's
my girlfriend.

510
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,867
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.

511
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:18,900
We're both afraid of commitment,
but, the fact is,

512
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,734
we also can't live
without each other.

513
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,768
And if the alternative
is not being together,

514
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:24,967
then it's worth taking
this risk 'cause...

515
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:27,967
...she's awesome.

516
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,434
And he's awesome.

517
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,501
He looks nice in a suit.

518
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,800
She can handle
her Scotch.

519
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,467
He's my boyfriend.

520
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,401
And she's my girlfriend.

521
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,200
Oh!

522
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,734
(shoutg):
Good enough!

523
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,234
(both laughing)

524
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:52,434
We are good. She bought it.

525
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:53,933
Hook, line, and sinker.

526
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,100
are good.

527
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,200
Oh, totally. Mm.

528
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,134
So, you want
to get some breakfast?

529
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:00,967
You know, brunch actuall
does sound kind of good.

530
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,833
Hmm. Well, lead the way,
sweetie pie.

531
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,367
Wow! Flugelhorn.

532
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, that felt wrong.
Mm.

533
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Mm.
(laughs)

534
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:20,367
You do realize
they were lying, right?

535
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,933
No, Ted.

536
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,334
They don't realize
they weren't lying.

537
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,933
<i>NARRATOR:
And that's the story</i>

538
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,234
<i>of how Barney and Robin became
boyfriend and girlfriend.</i>

539
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,668
Oh, hello.

540
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,334
Hello. Good evening.

541
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,800
Hello. Don't get up.

542
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,367
Didn't we meet on a yacht?

543
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:41,000
Hello.

544
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,034
What?

545
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,234
Oh, no!

546
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,967
Did I not tell you guys
that it was Tuxedo Night?

547
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:53,734
Doesn't feel
very good, does it?
