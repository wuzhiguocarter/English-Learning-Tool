1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,052
y of my stories I'm a
starry-eyed romantic

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,221
on a noble search for true love.

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,790
In this one, I'm just a jerk.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:13,428
Well, guys, tonight is the night.

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,130
to see my antique
camera collection.

6
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:17,332
Ah! It's Ted's bait.

7
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,399
"Bait"?

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,635
A true gentleman invents a pretense

9
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:22,937
to lure an honorable
lady into his apartment.

10
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:25,406
Some item of interest
or beauty you can both

11
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:26,908
pretend to admire for five minutes

12
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:29,377
before she hops on
your disco stick.

13
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:30,945
Like she's coming up
to "borrow a book"

14
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,981
or "check out an album on vinyl."

15
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,315
Or to see your new rap poster.

16
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,050
"Rap poster"?

17
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:37,285
Who would that work on?

18
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:39,454
It was the first week of college.

19
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:41,422
I was really into Wu-Tang Clan.

20
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,925
Yeah, bait is tricky.

21
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:46,694
It has to be something interesting
enough to get the girl upstairs,

22
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,030
but not so interesting that
it overpowers the night.

23
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:51,432
I found that a slot machine
was too fun.

24
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,904
And a trampoline...

25
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,907
turned out to be too dangerous.

26
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,344
But then I found the perfect bait:

27
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:05,580
a teacup pig.

28
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,651
"A teacup pig"?
Who's that working on?

29
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,819
You have a teacup pig?
! I didn't know you had a teacup pig!

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,787
Can we see the teacup pig?!

31
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:15,056
Hey, can I borrow your teacup pig?

32
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:17,091
Yes, you can borrow my teacup pig.

33
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,693
You have a teacup pig?! Oh,
my gosh!

34
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:19,961
I can't believe you
have a teacup pig!

35
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:21,062
You're just so cute!

36
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:23,231
Yes, you are the cutest piggy ever!

37
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,099
What?

38
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,734
Were you always this pretty?

39
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:28,269
Or are you going to
give me that whole,

40
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,905
"Oh, in high school I was
really shy and awkward" line?

41
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,807
I was shy and awkward.

42
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:34,342
I was, like,
a hundred pounds heavier

43
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:36,944
and I had these crazy
buck teeth. Seriously?

44
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:39,247
No, I've always been hot.

45
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:41,849
What are you going to do?

46
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:46,120
Do you know who else would
love this teacup pig?

47
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,789
Hmm?

48
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,524
My boyfriend.

49
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,595
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

50
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,306
You have a boyfriend?

51
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:06,474
Ugh, I know.

52
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:08,609
So annoying, right? I mean, he's

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,411
not really my boyfriend.

54
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:12,347
Oh, good. I mean,

55
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:14,048
technically, he kind of is.

56
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,783
Well, is he or isn't he?

57
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:19,153
Some of both,
but definitely not either.

58
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:21,122
Are you getting any of this?

59
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:24,625
Look, I really like you.

60
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,794
I just need you to be patient.

61
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:30,631
I don't want to lose you,
Big Brown Eyes.

62
00:02:32,668 --> 00:02:35,503
Yup. Somebody doesn't want to lose

63
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,971
Big Brown Eyes.

64
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:38,539
Oh, Ted.

65
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,575
She's got you on the hook.

66
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,610
What? What? I'm not on the hook.

67
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,779
Oh, you are totally on the hook.

68
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,280
She's stringing you along.

69
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,715
She's not committing to you,

70
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,717
but she's keeping you
around just in case,

71
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:52,987
like an old can of
chili in the pantry.

72
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:54,322
Um, who's buying canned chili

73
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:57,392
and not eating it immediately?
Amen, sister.

74
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,461
Ted, don't feel bad.
We've all been there.

75
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,596
I've been on both sides of it.

76
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:03,164
I've been a hookey and a hooker.

77
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,599
Move past it, guys.

78
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
I've been a little bit loose,

79
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:08,069
but money never changed hands.

80
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,671
I've been on the hook.

81
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,740
Lisa Walker. Picture it:

82
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:16,411
1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.

83
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:19,981
So I was, like, thinking, Lisa-

84
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:24,752
do you maybe want to,
like, go out with me?

85
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:27,188
That sounds great.

86
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,257
But I'm sort of seeing this guy.

87
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:30,525
He's got a LeBaron convertible

88
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:32,093
and an "in" at the roller rink,

89
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:34,262
so I'd hate to burn that bridge.

90
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:38,399
I understand.

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,034
But how about this?

92
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,636
You can be my secret boyfriend

93
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,271
who does all my homework for me.

94
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,775
A'ight.

95
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,945
You want to see my rap poster?

96
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:52,814
Poster whore.

97
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,382
Anyway...

98
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:57,084
Lisa Walker strung
me along for months

99
00:03:57,085 --> 00:04:00,354
until one night,
I went to go tell her

100
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:01,656
how much I loved her.

101
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:02,857
Aww. Hmm. Ugh.

102
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:04,058
In song.

103
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:06,661
 She wasn't home yet,

104
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,896
so I waited.

105
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,567
And waited.

106
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:17,138
I woke up four hours later,
covered in snow.

107
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,173
And that's when I saw it.

108
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:22,643
Lisa's footsteps.

109
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:25,980
She had walked right over me
and into the house.

110
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,016
It was the best thing
that could have happened.

111
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,485
It got me off her hook.

112
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,019
Okay, that is definitely not

113
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,488
what's going on
with me and Tiffany.

114
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:34,822
Listen to this.

115
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:37,925
I'm really into you.

116
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:41,362
I just can't be with you right now.

117
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:44,131
Huh?! Huh?!

118
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,834
Ted, "right no" is the classic

119
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,436
on-the-hook catchphrase. Yup.

120
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:51,272
"Right now" paints a picture of
some sort of magical future time

121
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:52,373
when everything will work out,

122
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:55,309
but the truth is,
that will never happen.

123
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,210
It's like this.

124
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:59,080
"I can't be with you." Boom!

125
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,648
"Right now."

126
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:04,852
Yeah.

127
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:06,521
I think my high school
boyfriend, Scooter,

128
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,256
is still sort of
on the hook for me.

129
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,324
Sort of? He totally is.

130
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:13,160
The poor guy showed up at our
wedding hoping to win you back.

131
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,428
Yeah.

132
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:15,563
It's still sometimes weird

133
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:17,632
when I see him at work. Wait. What?

134
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,568
Scooter works in the
school cafeteria.

135
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,036
We've talked about this.

136
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,671
Hey, Lily. Nice dress.

137
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,506
Tater-tots?

138
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,512
We most certainly have
not talked about this!

139
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:32,680
Yes, we have.

140
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,515
I've mentioned it tons of times.

141
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,384
"Lunch Lady Scooter."

142
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,386
I thought that you were referring

143
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:41,088
to some sort of long overdue
device that carries around

144
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,758
those poor, underappreciated
lunch ladies!

145
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,193
This explains a lot.

146
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,763
Lunch Lady Scooter was
there again today.

147
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,232
Oh, yeah? Did you
jump on that thing?

148
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,501
Give it a ride? No!

149
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:55,937
Really? If it were me,
I'd be riding that scooter

150
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,906
all day long until I
broke that thang in half.

151
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,476
So those poor women still
have to walk everywhere?

152
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,479
Wait. Scooter is working
at your school?!

153
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,082
Are you jealous?

154
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,284
No, I just feel bad for Scooter.

155
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,919
'Cause the only reason
he took that job

156
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,254
is he thinks he has
a shot with you.

157
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:15,222
You have to make it
clear that he doesn't,

158
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,491
so that he can move on
and a real lunch lady

159
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:19,327
can get her job back. Damn!

160
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:21,195
I've tried.

161
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,697
Hey, Lily.

162
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:26,133
I saw you had seventh
period free. So do I.

163
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,802
You want to run away together?

164
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,504
Let me be clear, Scooter.

165
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:34,542
There is no way you and
I can ever be together.

166
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,218
Right now.

167
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,519
I'll see you tomorrow, Lily.

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,455
It's Tijuana Tuesday.

169
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,459
"Right now"?

170
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,827
You right-now'd Scooter?

171
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:55,630
You need to let Scooter off
the hook once and for all.

172
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,697
You're right.

173
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:57,832
Day after tomorrow,

174
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,333
that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

175
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,668
Why not tomorrow?

176
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,838
Baby, I can't ruin Tijuana Tuesday.

177
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,807
Really?

178
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:09,610
You're really going to sit here
all night watching the door

179
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:12,446
because Tiffany said
she'll "try to stop by"?

180
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,782
Barney, I'm not going
to just give up on her.

181
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:17,051
I should have given up on her.

182
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,520
This girl is special.

183
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,023
She was the devil.

184
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,291
Things are going to
work out with Tiffany.

185
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,894
No, they're not, dumbass.

186
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:30,431
Ted, let me be clear:
this girl is a poison

187
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:33,334
and you need to cut her
out of your life forever.

188
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,804
Hey, there she is.

189
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,575
Oh, she brought some
of her coworkers.

190
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,448
Hang on to this girl, Ted.

191
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:49,650
Hang on to her and never let go!

192
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,603
these are some of the hottest
girls I've ever seen.

193
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,138
And they all work with Tiffany?

194
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,107
Yup. There could only be

195
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,175
one explanation for this.

196
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:06,211
Ted...

197
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:07,879
is Tiffany a ph-ph-ph...

198
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,215
pharmaceutical sales rep?

199
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:11,383
Yeah, how did you know that?

200
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,417
And you never thought

201
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:14,586
to mention that?

202
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,421
What? It's just a job.

203
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:20,725
Just a j... just a jah...

204
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:23,728
Ted, throughout time

205
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,064
there has always been one
cutting-edge profession

206
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:28,967
to which hot girls,
like Tiffany, have flocked.

207
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,235
Shall I walk you
through the history?

208
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,936
I'm gonna explicitly say no.

209
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:35,206
It all started 2.
5 million years ago.

210
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,308
 Man was a hunter.

211
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,211
So, the hottest profession
of the day?

212
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:41,312
Gatherer.

213
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,748
Homo erectus indeed.

214
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,353
As man mastered technology,

215
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:50,855
the hottest profession of
the day evolved.

216
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,424
I'm pretty sure it's a hernia.

217
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,592
Can you check again?

218
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,165
And then, man took to the skies.

219
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,734
And so, hot women put
on high heels

220
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:04,269
and became stewardesses.

221
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:08,473
I am in the upright
and locked position.

222
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,946
And then man said, "Life is hard.

223
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:17,415
I should start taking
lotsf prescription drugs."

224
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,583
And so, hot girls

225
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:20,318
rolled into doctors' offices,

226
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,787
looking sexy enough to render
the very erection pills

227
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,422
they peddled ironically redundant.

228
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:25,623
So now,

229
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:27,559
pharma girls are today's

230
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
hottest profession.

231
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,597
Hey, Big Brown Eyes. How you doing?

232
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,799
I'm good.

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,201
Hey, by the way, you, uh,

234
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:38,203
you ditch that loser boyfriend yet?

235
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,838
No, sir.

236
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,576
Touched my nose.

237
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:48,113
Dude, ditch Tiffany
and join the Barnacle

238
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,014
in a pharma girl free-for-all.

239
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:52,684
Side effects may include
loss of clothing, rug burn,

240
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:55,220
shortness of breath and sore
abdominals the next morning.

241
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,188
What in the world is up?!

242
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,826
Hey. So...

243
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:03,461
I know that you've
been having trouble

244
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,296
letting Scooter off the hook.

245
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:07,599
Well, I decided what
you need is practice.

246
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,635
Now, you say the problem
is his cute, sad eyes?

247
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:12,737
Well...

248
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,376
Aww!

249
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,645
All right, shut it, woman.

250
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,181
Now, I want you to look at this

251
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:26,217
teacup pig and tell him
that there's no way

252
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,319
that you could ever be with him.

253
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,126
Teacup Pig, there is no way

254
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,428
I can ever be with you.

255
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:46,671
Right now.

256
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:48,439
Oh, come on! Grow a pair!

257
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,441
I'm sorry, but he's

258
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,610
just so freakin' cute.

259
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,013
I just want to cuddle
him all day long.

260
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:57,048
Yes, I do. You know that's funny.

261
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,651
I remember when you used to
say things like that about me.

262
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,152
Oh, I still do.

263
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,888
Yeah, not as much, Lily.

264
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,890
Not as much.

265
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,061
* Ain't no party like
a pharma girl party *

266
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:12,030
* 'Cause a pharma girl
party don't stop! *

267
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,766
Dude, I have already hooked
up with three of them.

268
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:15,934
Fantasmo.

269
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:17,869
Plus, my cholesterol is down.

270
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,404
My restless legs syndrome is cured.

271
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:21,372
I've never felt more alive- oh.

272
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,108
Guys, great news.

273
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:25,810
Tiffany broke up
with her boyfriend.

274
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,245
Proof that I am not on the hook.

275
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:28,680
Oh, you're still on the hook.

276
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:32,016
Ah, uh-uh, listen to how
we spent last night.

277
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:34,219
First, we cuddled.

278
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:40,124
Then, we shared chocolate cake.

279
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,895
Then, well, I don't usually join
in on locker room talk,

280
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:48,233
but I gave her a pretty
sensual foot rub.

281
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:54,339
And let me guess: it didn't
go any further than that.

282
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,506
Well, no, but...

283
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,508
And tell me, did you by any chance

284
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,177
make that chocolate cake?

285
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,346
It was a mix.

286
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:02,313
Dude.

287
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,616
There's no shame in
admitting it, Ted.

288
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:06,551
We've all been on people's hooks

289
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:08,953
and we've all kept
someone on the hook.

290
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,855
Um, I most certainly have not.

291
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,923
What?!

292
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,157
Are you joking?

293
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:16,327
What about that girl from
the university library?

294
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:17,929
Um, Henrietta?

295
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,031
Henrietta and I are just friends.

296
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,233
Oh, she is so on your hook.

297
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:24,002
Absolutely not.

298
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:25,703
 She totally was.

299
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,904
I mean...

300
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:28,673
we cuddled.

301
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,012
We shared chocolate cake.

302
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,316
She gave me foot rubs- long ones.

303
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,885
I'm not proud, kids.

304
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,654
You like having Henrietta
around for the same reason

305
00:12:42,655 --> 00:12:44,756
that Tiffany likes
having you around:

306
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:46,958
it's a nice little ego boost.

307
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,359
No wonder you're such an expert

308
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,194
about keeping people on the hook.

309
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:52,430
What about that poor
camera guy you work with?

310
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,098
Mike and I are just friends.

311
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,800
Come on.

312
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:57,535
Mmm...

313
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:00,338
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

314
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:01,706
Robin, have you ever thought

315
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,941
about taking us to the next level?

316
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,610
Well, if you're talking
about doing my laundry,

317
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:06,711
I'm on board.

318
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,179
You got yourself a deal.

319
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,847
Hmm.

320
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:10,848
What?!

321
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,917
I- I am not keeping
Mike on the hook.

322
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,752
You are Captain Hook.

323
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,287
Dude, I'm a girl.

324
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,790
Okayour girl parts
are like a spiderweb.

325
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,858
Sometimes you're gonna
catch stuff you don't want.

326
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:22,393
That doesn't

327
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:23,494
make it okay.

328
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,730
Oh, a-and Henrietta is in,
in no way

329
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:27,165
wasting her time with you, right?

330
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,133
Henrietta knows that
we're just friends.

331
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,835
In fact, I'm gonna call her up

332
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:34,038
and hang out with her
tonight as friends.

333
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,540
Hey, Ted. Hey.

334
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,774
I love you.

335
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,376
What? Uh, do you
want a foot massage?

336
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:40,545
'Cause I've been
practicing on myself.

337
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:42,580
No, I'm good.

338
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,048
I didn't know if you were hungry,

339
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,417
so I just threw together some...
it's not a big deal.

340
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:49,087
Kids, looking back,
I don't know how I didn't see

341
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,222
that Henrietta was madly
in love with me.

342
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,926
Oh.

343
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,961
Hello. Hey, Ted.

344
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:57,962
Hey, Tiffany.

345
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:58,930
I'm going out of town

346
00:13:58,931 --> 00:13:59,964
this weekend for my
friend's wedding.

347
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,400
Want to be my date?

348
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,668
I would love to.

349
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,136
Hey, what are you doing right now?

350
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,904
Oh, God, no.

351
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:09,307
Awesome. Okay, I'll see you in,
like, ten minutes?

352
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,608
Great.

353
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:12,310
Soy, Henrietta,

354
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,344
something came up.

355
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:15,279
Take a rain check, pal?

356
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,748
Yeah, it's no problem.

357
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,616
All right, yeah, hey-ho.
Oh, you're strong.

358
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:21,419
What a jerk.

359
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,088
Henrietta, I...

360
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,890
Wait. Where did Ted go?

361
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,592
I thought we were finally
going to get to meet him.

362
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:28,793
Yeah, something came up, okay, Mom?

363
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:32,397
I told you there was no Ted.

364
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,899
I heard that.

365
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:39,874
So there I was,
at one of the surest signs

366
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,277
of taking a relationship
to the next level:

367
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:44,078
an out-of-town wedding.

368
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,513
It was finally happening.

369
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,781
Champagne?

370
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:49,717
Ted, oh, my gosh,
I forgot to call you.

371
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,152
Well, whatever it is you
wanted to talk about,

372
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:52,487
we can talk about it now.

373
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:55,590
This is Jack.

374
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:57,292
He's the best man at the wedding.

375
00:14:57,293 --> 00:14:59,461
We just got back together.

376
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:00,762
You know, now that
I think about it,

377
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,530
a phone call would have been nice.

378
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:05,467
You're Ted? Ouch.

379
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:08,336
But I hear you make a
mean chocolate cake.

380
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,841
Oh, isn't he great?

381
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:15,176
And he's in a band.

382
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,846
Thanks.

383
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:20,148
Come on, Lily. You have to
get Scooter off the hook.

384
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,316
Now, try again.

385
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:24,686
Teacup Pig, oh...

386
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:27,422
I don't want to be with you.

387
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,797
Right now.

388
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:38,199
Man up!

389
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:42,604
Teacup Pig...

390
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:44,572
I don't want to be with you.

391
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:50,778
Ever.

392
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,180
Finish him!

393
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,215
We will never be together

394
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:57,185
in any sort of sexual
way ever again.

395
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:58,353
Nice.

396
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:00,822
Sort of a weird thing
to say to a pig.

397
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:01,990
It felt really wrong.

398
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,160
Anyway, I just don't think
you and I are going to work.

399
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,730
Right now.

400
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,932
 And that's when it hit me.

401
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,233
I was on the hook.

402
00:16:12,234 --> 00:16:13,735
I also realized...

403
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:16,004
I missed this so much, baby.

404
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:18,006
...Tiffany was on this guy's hook.

405
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,440
It was a vicious cycle.

406
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:21,009
Henrietta was on my hook.

407
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,244
And years later, I found out
this poor bastard

408
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,812
was on Henrietta's hook.

409
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:29,417
You know what?

410
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:32,020
We're not going to work ever.

411
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,789
I'm done.

412
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:39,427
And it's really better
for the circulation

413
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,496
if you knead the arches
with your thumbs.

414
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:42,997
Now, I'm done.

415
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,503
Marshall, I can do this by myself.

416
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:50,104
Okay, well, then prove it.

417
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:53,074
And, um...

418
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,109
Grab me a pudding.

419
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,681
Listen up, Scooter.

420
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:02,850
There is no way you and
I will ever be together.

421
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:11,960
Right now! Marshall!

422
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:15,363
I'm sorry, but he's
adorable. Listen.

423
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,698
I don't want to be with you.

424
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:18,533
Right now. Hang in there, Scoots!

425
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:20,268
I'm not going to live forever.

426
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:23,738
Last night I was with
this pharma girl who was

427
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,239
so hot, you should call a doctor

428
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,042
if you don't have an erection
for more than four hours.

429
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:30,311
Am I right, people?

430
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:31,346
Yeah, there's no people-

431
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:33,648
just the girl you
most recently dated.

432
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,384
Hey, Barney.

433
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:38,720
I want you to meet the
newest pharma girl.

434
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,787
Oh.

435
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:40,788
Gladys Reynolds.

436
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,223
Nice to make your acquaintance.

437
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:45,994
I represent statins and other
cholesterol-lowering drugs.

438
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:48,096
Come on, girl.
Let's go get our drink on.

439
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:52,233
It's over.

440
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:53,434
What's over?

441
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:57,705
Pharma girls are no longer
exclusively hot chicks.

442
00:17:57,706 --> 00:18:00,141
It's the en. You're being

443
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:01,175
a little dramatic.

444
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,543
Am I?

445
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:04,278
It starts out with a Gladys.

446
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,547
Next thing you know,
a few not-so-fabulous

447
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:08,116
gay guys enter the ranks.

448
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:09,484
And before you know it,

449
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,786
pharma girls look like the crew

450
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,889
on a Southwest flight from
Albuquerque to Little Rock.

451
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,660
It's over!

452
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:21,729
So that night, I went straight
to Henrietta's-

453
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,731
all set to let her off the hook.

454
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:33,775
This is Jack.

455
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:35,510
He's the best man at the wedding.

456
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,683
I'm done.

457
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:47,121
Yes!

458
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:49,323
The answer is yes!

459
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,093
No.

460
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:54,629
Oh, it gets worse.

461
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,164
It's perfect!

462
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:59,133
Mom, Dad! Ted proposed!

463
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:01,636
Oh, my God! I knew
this day would come!

464
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:04,872
Son! Yeah, well, there's been a...

465
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:07,775
No. What did you do?

466
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:11,646
I seriously considered
just marrying her

467
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,147
out of sheer awkwardness.

468
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:15,383
But I did what I had to do.

469
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:19,020
I did what anyone keeping
someone on the hook should do.

470
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,655
I broke her heart.

471
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:23,057
Henrietta, I'm sorry
if this is blunt,

472
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:24,826
but I think I owe you this.

473
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,830
I don't want to be with you.

474
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:31,332
Right now?

475
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,201
Ever.

476
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,638
But we're still getting
married, right?

477
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:41,275
It was brutal.

478
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:42,677
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

479
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,645
Honesty is tough, but in the end,

480
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,014
it is the far kinder alternative.

481
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,850
Yeah.

482
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:50,918
Hey, sweetie.

483
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:53,955
Hey, Mike.

484
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:56,224
I have to tell you something.

485
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,026
Wait. Did you finish my delicates?

486
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:01,362
Got one more load. Ah, it can wait.

487
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:06,534
I...

488
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,688
Hey. Hey, how's it going?

489
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,090
Still in mourning over the
end of the pharma girl era?

490
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,659
No. I realized that their reign

491
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,529
had to end to make room for
some new hot girl profession.

492
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:25,267
Maybe it'll be intergalactic
communications officer

493
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:27,603
on a rocket ship to some
distant solar system

494
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:29,404
we can't possibly imagine.

495
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:32,007
Maybe it'll be... meter maids.

496
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:33,342
We just don't know.

497
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:36,578
But one thing is sure.

498
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:41,416
The future glows like a giant sun

499
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:46,088
shooting amber rays of light
into our hearts and minds.

500
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:50,125
Wow, uh, what changed your mind?

501
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:53,161
The realization that hope
springs eternal, Robin.

502
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:56,331
That and this little
bottle of purple pills

503
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:58,300
I found in my couch cushion.

504
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:01,303
Don't know what they are,
but they are amazing!
