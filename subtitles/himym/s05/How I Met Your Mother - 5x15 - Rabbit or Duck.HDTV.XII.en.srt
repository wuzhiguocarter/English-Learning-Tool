00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:04,902
<i>at my apartment to watch
the Super Bowl.</i>

2
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:06,777
<i>Well, not all of us.</i>

00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,106
ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to
Super Bowl XLIV in Miami.

4
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:12,592
Get a load of that guy.

5
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:15,965
You think that's his real number?

6
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:16,933
Well, that explains

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,375
where Barney is. Dibs on his wings.

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,465
(ringtone playing) Hey, guys. Hey.

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,799
Does anyone know who won the Super Bowl?

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,701
You were there. It was the... I won,

12
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:41,402
because I am now in
possession of a magic phone

13
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:42,936
that always rings.

14
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,270
And do you know who's always

15
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:45,371
usually on the other end?

16
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:46,471
A chick.

17
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:48,873
So how many chicks do I have calling me now?

18
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,875
Infinity.

19
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:51,877
(ringtone continues)

20
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:53,781
You guys remember Ranjit. Hello.

21
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:55,583
TED & MARSHALL: Hey, Ranjit,
good to see you. Hey.

22
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,219
I've enlisted Ranjit's
services as my personal driver

23
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,388
because for the next week,

24
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:59,989
I will be sleeping with hundreds of women,

25
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,461
and I don't want to take the subway,
'cause you know, germs.

26
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:05,364
Wait, you're actually gonna
hook up with these girls

27
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,332
that call you? Oh, indubitably.

28
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,933
I'm meeting the first one here any minute.

29
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,668
Keep your eyes peeled for a red sweater.

30
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,436
Based on her texts, she's dirty,

31
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:15,772
dyslexic, and wants to 96 me.

32
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:18,141
Semicolon, end parentheses.

33
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:19,508
TED: This ought to be good.

34
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:21,410
I can only imagine the quality
of girl that... Oh, my God,

35
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:23,778
<i>you are the guy from the Super Bowl.</i>

36
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:27,515
Magic phone, guys, magic phone.

37
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,516
ROBIN: Hey, guys, hey, Ranjit.

38
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:31,485
How's it going? Hey. Hello. Hey.

39
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:33,822
That beer looks a little flat.

40
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:34,824
It's Scotch.

41
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:35,825
Whoa.

42
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:36,859
Something troubling you, kiddo?

43
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,095
(sighs) Don.

44
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:42,400
<i>Don was Aunt Robin's co-host on her morning
show.</i>

45
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:44,202
<i>Now, even though her show
was on so early</i>

46
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:45,336
<i>that no one watched,</i>

47
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:47,673
<i>Aunt Robin was a consummate
professional,</i>

48
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,975
<i>but Don was not.</i>

49
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,076
Oh, yeah.

50
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,646
<i>But that morning,
Don had gone too far.</i>

51
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:57,086
Now, that's what I call having
a "woof" over your head.

52
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:59,354
Don.

53
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:00,523
Don?

54
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:04,127
<i>Why is Ulee's Gold in
every crossword?</i>

55
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:06,363
Oh, it's me? Sorry, sorry.

56
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:09,166
Uh, next Sunday is Valentine's Day,

57
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,035
and one lucky patient will be receiving

58
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:15,206
a very special chocolate heart-
a human heart.

59
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:16,241
Oh, hey, that reminds me.

60
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:17,509
I've been meaning to ask you.

61
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,079
Robin, do you have any, uh,
Valentine's Day plans?

62
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,715
He asked you out?

63
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,984
He asked me out. That's crazy.

64
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:26,920
And they use "Ulee" because of the vowels.

65
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:27,920
Ah.

66
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,222
What did you say? Well,

67
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:32,458
we were on the air,
I was on the spot, so I said okay.

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,726
(chuckles)

69
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:37,730
Robin, you are going to marry
this guy so freaking hard.

70
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,064
Right in the butt.

71
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,967
What?! No, I hate Don,

72
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:43,134
and now I can't cancel

73
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,403
because I said I would go
out with him on the air.

74
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:46,871
What would your viewer think?

75
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:48,072
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

76
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:49,740
you said you'd go out
with him on Valentine's?

77
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:50,775
I thought we had plans.

78
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:51,943
What, getting drunk

79
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:54,546
and cleaning the apartment was a plan?

80
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:59,083
I did not say it was a good plan.

81
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,185
Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now,

82
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:04,589
and it is getting interesting.
Look at these texts.

83
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,091
Read this one.

84
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,092
Yowza!

85
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,161
Now, look at this one. Does she text

86
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,596
her mother with those fingers?

87
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:11,830
Now, look at this one.

88
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,565
Or this one

89
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,100
or this one or this one.

90
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,201
Okay, okay, okay,

91
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,936
buddy, how, how about you do this?

92
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:20,738
Go nail that girl, then read your texts.

93
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,206
I can't do that, Ted. (ringtone playing)

94
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:25,476
I just can't hook up with a
girl if there is a hotter girl

95
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:28,779
out there with whom up can be hooked.

96
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,315
Isn't there always a hotter girl?

97
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:32,283
I know.

98
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,118
Isn't it wonderful?

99
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,187
Go for Barney.

100
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:37,688
Cut to the chase-- what's your cup size?

101
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:38,890
Oh, hi, Mom.

102
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,660
There's always a hotter girl.

103
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:44,461
Isn't that the problem in a nutshell?

104
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:46,330
There's too many options-
you got Internet dating,

105
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,297
you got bars...

106
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:48,398
Holding up

107
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,967
your phone number on national TV.

108
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:50,968
(both chuckle)

109
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,571
I never had that problem.

110
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:57,676
When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage,

111
00:03:57,677 --> 00:04:01,547
and I love my wife more and more every day.

112
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:02,782
Hmm. MARSHALL: It is true.

113
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:05,485
It's, it's very rare
that two people just meet

114
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,387
and fall madly in love, like Robin and Don.

115
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,555
Oh,

116
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,523
we-we're not even, like,
going out for dinner.

117
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:12,025
We're just hanging out at his place.

118
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,192
LILY & TED: Ooh...

119
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:14,460
No, it's not like that.

120
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:16,396
It's just us and a bunch of other people.

121
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,331
Oh. Oh. Whoo...

122
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:22,735
Wait, Robin, what exactly did
Don say when he asked you out?

123
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:24,704
I'm having some friends over
at my place for a little party.

124
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,106
You should come by if you want.

125
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:28,175
Uh...

126
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:31,345
Okay.

127
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:35,348
Robin, Don didn't ask you out.

128
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,484
Uh, of course he asked me out.

129
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,652
Uh, no, he didn't.

130
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,253
Yes, he did.

131
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:41,821
He did.

132
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,290
He did-- he did!

133
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,424
Okay.

134
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:45,425
Well, dog

135
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:46,426
my cats.

136
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:47,861
I think I know what's going on here.

137
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:51,397
Robin, did you want Don to ask you out?

138
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:52,932
What?! (laughter)

139
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,967
No, I hate Don.

140
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:57,303
I-I can't stop thinking
about how much I hate him.

141
00:04:57,304 --> 00:04:58,972
It's like, it's like all the time.

142
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:00,640
I just want to attack him

143
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,075
and rip his stupid clothes off

144
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:03,810
and just spank him with his little paddle

145
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:05,978
until his bum's all red.

146
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,380
Shut up!

147
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,717
See?

148
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:13,487
That right there is what
free will gets you--

149
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:16,457
constant, ego-shattering uncertainty.

150
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,525
I'm done with that.

151
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,994
I want what Ranjit has.

152
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:20,629
I've spent my entire adult life

153
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,464
looking for the perfect woman,

154
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:25,134
and I'm spending Valentine's
Day scrubbing the toilet.

155
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,435
I need someone else

156
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:29,271
to find me that woman.

157
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:33,908
Marshall, Lily, arranged marriage me.

158
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,477
(ringtone playing) Or this one

159
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:38,346
or this one or this one.

160
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:45,751
You want us to arrange your marriage?

161
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:46,697
Absolutely.

162
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:48,391
Look, there's two sides to dating, right?

163
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,114
Picking and getting picked.

164
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,864
Getting picked I'm good at.

165
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,039
Ladies love Teddy West Side.

166
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,709
You're waiting for me to comment

167
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,646
on your self-assigned nickname.

168
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:02,782
All right, well, here's my comment.

169
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,451
I love it. Really?

170
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:06,586
Teddy West Side, continue.

171
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:07,721
It's the picking I suck at.

172
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:10,090
I pick the wrong girls, but you guys--

173
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:11,358
you're the best pickers I know.

174
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,593
You picked each other.

175
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,028
Aw-- well, with a slight assist

176
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,430
from the Wesleyan Housing Department.

177
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:18,900
And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir.

178
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:20,568
Get out there, find me a girl.

179
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,236
We'll double-date on Valentine's Day.

180
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:24,839
If I like her, I will marry her...

181
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,274
if she's cool with it, and she will be...

182
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,243
'cause I'll wear my nice blazer.

183
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:33,980
I love that blazer almost
as much as Robin loves Don.

184
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,115
I do not love Don.

185
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:36,149
Robin,

186
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,650
neurologically speaking,

187
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,952
the part of the human brain
that makes you hate people

188
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:42,021
is located right next
to the part of the brain

189
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:43,556
that makes you want to jump people's bones.

190
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:45,391
The two responses are so similar,

191
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:46,625
it's hard to tell them apart.

192
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:49,027
You know what it's like? Wait.

193
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:50,028
I have to get a book.

194
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,330
Give me 30 seconds!

195
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:52,965
Okay, this is fun.

196
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:53,966
Look at this picture.

197
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,601
It's a rabbit.

198
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,003
You can look at it for hours

199
00:06:57,004 --> 00:07:00,239
and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit,

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,041
but then one day you look at it

201
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,677
and you realize-- wait a second--

202
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:05,979
it's a duck.

203
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,148
Hmm. It's a rabbit, it's a duck.

204
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:10,117
Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck.

205
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:11,252
Isn't this fun?

206
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:12,720
<i>NARRATOR: It sure was.</i>

207
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,788
Well, relationships are like that.

208
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:16,458
I mean, look, when you first met Don,

209
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,392
you hated him.

210
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,394
You thought, "This guy is a duck,"

211
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,397
but one of these days,
you're going to realize,

212
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:23,299
"This is actually something that I love.

213
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
He's a rabbit."

214
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,401
TED: Whoa.

215
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:27,536
I think you got it backwards there, buddy.

216
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,972
The duck is the thing you love,

217
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,474
the rabbit is the thing you hate.

218
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:33,809
What? Yeah, I gotta

219
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,110
agree; ducks up, rabbits down.

220
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,645
Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits.

221
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:38,846
MARSHALL: Ducks are...

222
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:39,947

224
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,250
Ducks are, like...

225
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:44,886
Have you ever been in a fight with a duck?

226
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,255
I mean, ducks are jerks!

227
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,457
<i>This led to one of the most
intense arguments</i>

228
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,159
<i>our group has ever had.</i>

(fast-forwarding)

230
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,261
Duck is delicious!

231
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:54,063
Rabbit is all gamey!

232
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:55,764
We're not talking about flavor, Ted!

233
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:56,865
Flavor counts!

234
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,333
(fast-forwarding)

235
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,803
Who carries around a
duck's foot for good luck?!

236
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:01,837
Anyone?!

237
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:03,105
(fast-forwarding)

238
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,540
You wrap yourself in a comforter

239
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,841
stuffed with rabbit hair!

240
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:09,544
I'll wrap myself in one
stuffed with duck feathers!

241
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:10,713
Who's cozier?

242
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:13,749
No, no, no, no, but who's cozier?!

243
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,750

244

(fast-forwarding)

248
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:27,897
Then why don't we take a rabbit, a duck,

249
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,733
<i>stick 'em in a cardboard box, and let them

250
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:32,235
Because it's illegal, Ted!

251
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:34,237
Only if we bet on it, Marshall!

252
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,805
(fast-forwarding)

253
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,141
Fine!

254
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,442
I concede!

255
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,577
You win!

256
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:43,646
Say it.

257
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,815
You have to say it.

258
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,684
Ducks good...

259
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:52,788
(faintly): rabbits are bad.

260
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:54,389
Yes! Yes!

261
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,857
Yes! It feels so good!

262
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,092
Yes.

263
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:58,927
Thank you. And Don is--

264
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,430
and always will be-- a rabbit.

265
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:03,866
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin.

266
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,434
Think about it. Don?

267
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,403
Donald?

268
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:09,939
Donald... Duck?

269
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:15,611
And what, I wonder,
does Donald Duck never wear?

270
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:16,546
Pants.

271
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:17,947
Pants.

272
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:21,651
Don's a duck.

00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,153
Permission to say "lawyered"?

275
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:24,955
I'll allow it.

276
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:26,556

Want to marry my friend Ted?

366
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,274
What, you can be choosy?

367
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:07,943
You're in a bar on Valentine's Day, huh?

368
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,012
Hey, just real quick...

369
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,648
Aah!

370
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,118
You want to marry my friend Ted?

371
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,853
Man, Ted's right.

372
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:18,388
It's tough out there.

373
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:19,456
This is stupid.

374
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,491
You know what? We forgot about this.

375
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:23,227
I'm sure Ted did, also.

376
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:24,962
âTª Here comes the groom âTª

377
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:26,797
âTª In his favorite blazer âTª

378
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,200
âTª Gonna meet my wife and I... âTª

379
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,503
Blazer, Tazer.

380
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:33,071
Gazer, Ta... Bazer?

381
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,439
ROBIN: Hey, Ted?

382
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,540
Yeah?

383
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,242
Before you go meet your future wife,

384
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:40,409
come to Don's party with me.

385
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:42,380
That's what you're wearing?

386
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:43,748
Yeah. Why?

387
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,149
He's a duck.

388
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,250
That dude be straight duckin'.

389
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,887
âTª And I think that I'll amaze her. âTª

390
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,255
Nailed it!

391
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,790
<i>NARRATOR: So we went to Don's party.</i>

392
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,792
Look, Robin, I don't want to crowd you

393
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:58,160
on your little date here, so

394
00:13:58,161 --> 00:13:59,929
if things start to get hot
and heavy with you and Don...

395
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,130
They're not gonna get hot and...

396
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,799
I'm just saying, if they do,

397
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,068
I'll just say, "Well,
I got a dinner rez," and then...

398
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:06,203
Wait. This is the best part.

399
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:07,738
I've been working on this for a while.

400
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:08,472
Hmm.

401
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,074
I'll duck out.

402
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:11,409
Ha, ha, ha.

403
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,744
Okay, it's not gonna happen.

404
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:14,512
But, yeah, do that.

405
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:15,947
Mm-hmm.

406
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,851
Hello, Robin.

407
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,353
(shrieks) Oh!

408
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:23,988
Well, I got a dinner rez.

409
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:28,956
Oh! Oh, God, Don,
what the hell are you doing?!

410
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,282
I don't know. It's something
called The Naked Man.

411
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,430
I read about it on some guy's blog.

412
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:35,066
My God, I'm so stupid.

413
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:36,859
Why did I ever think it would
work on someone like you?

414
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:39,573
Yeah, 'cause I would never...

415
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:42,944
Could, like... standards, so, you know.

416
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,913
I-I thought this was a party.

417
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:47,015
I only said that to get
you to come over here.

418
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:48,449
I didn't think you'd bring a date.

419
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,784
Ted's not my date.

420
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:51,352
He's a friend. Oh, God.

421
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,554
You probably think I'm some
kind of playboy now, right?

422
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,526
You could say that.

423
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,628
So he's a rabbit.

424
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,363
At least you know for sure.

425
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:05,031
Ted, this may hurt a little.

426
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:08,467
I'm recycling your old
Architecture Weekly Magazines.

427
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:09,835
What are you doing?

428
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:12,138
Cleaning. You go on your date.

429
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,973
Happy Valentine's Day.

430
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:20,880
Oh, thank God you're here.

431
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:22,315
Yeah, I've been thinking.

432
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:24,250
Um, maybe we should call
this whole thing off.

433
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:26,519
No! Ted, we got her. What?

434
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,387
We got her. It's, it's the craziest thing.

435
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:31,257
We were searching all week,
and then, a couple hours ago...

436
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:32,192
Trudy?

437
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:33,226
Married.

438
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:34,493
Blah, blah?

439
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,061
Committed.

440
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:35,861
Relationship?

441
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:36,696
Bellevue.

442
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:38,698
Natalie?

443
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,900
Ted's her least favorite
person in the world.

444
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:43,236
Well, she's not getting any younger.

445
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,370
(ringtone plays)

446
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,138
Get rid of it!

447
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:46,873
What?

448
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:48,441
This phone is cursed.

449
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:50,109
Cursed, I tell you!

450
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,079
I try to ignore it,
but it just never stops ringing!

451
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,914
It's ruining my life!

452
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:56,116
I should get that.

453
00:15:56,117 --> 00:15:57,050
No, please.

454
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:58,118
Please!

455
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,452
Please, Marshall, let me answer it.

456
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:00,620
It could be an emergency.

457
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:02,856
She could be trapped in a giant bra!

458
00:16:02,857 --> 00:16:04,524
Barney, Barney...

459
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:07,027
let it go... to voice mail.

460
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:08,528
(cries)

461
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:10,697
(mumbling)

462
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,265
Okay.

463
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:15,268
(crying)

464
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,537
We have to find Ted a wife.
We're being too choosy.

465
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:19,538
It almost doesn't matter
who it is at this point.

466
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,540
Okay.

467
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,408
(ringtone continues)

468
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:25,110
It's a phone girl? I know.

469
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:26,244
I know, but no.

470
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,746
Then we met her, and Ted,

471
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:31,515
she's a world-class violinist,
she's a gourmet cook, and...

472
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,618
<i>she can quote every line
from Caddyshack.</i>

473
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,154
Wow.

474
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,823
Hello, Ted.

475
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:42,461
And what brings you to
this nape of the woods?

476
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:43,896
Neck of the wape?

477
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:45,732
Why are you here?

478
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:49,303
<i>NARRATOR: So we all had dinner.</i>

479
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:52,039
<i>And kids, Marshall and Lily's hard work had
paid off,</i>

480
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,007
because that girl was terrific.

481
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,242
<i>In fact...</i>

482
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,945
Oh, but Natalia, tell Ted the problem.

483
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:00,313
Yeah, yeah, tell him, tell him!

484
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:02,249
Well, unfortunately,

485
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,718
I'm going to have to leave the country soon

486
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,855
because my visa is about to expire.

487
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,723
LILY (whispering): She needs to get married!

488
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:10,758
(whispering): Federal law expressly dictates

489
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,927
that a foreign national
can't maintain residency

490
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:16,063
for longer than six months
without a work visa, so...

491
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:17,997
NARRATOR: But when it came down to it...

492
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:19,933
And you, sir? The rabbit or the duck?

493
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,100
What?

494
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,301
It's a prix-fixe menu

495
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,569
for Valentine's Day,

496
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,804
and we're already out of steak,
fish and chicken.

497
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,606
So, rabbit or duck?

498
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,113
Rabbit. Sorry, guys.

499
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:36,648
I got to go.

500
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:39,517
Why would Ted order rabbit
if he was just gonna run out?

501
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,520
(whimpering): I need it back!
Where's the phone?

502
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,955
Well, hello.

503
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,490
Oh, I met you already.

504
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,891
Where's the phone?!

505
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:48,359
(sighs) It's hidden.

506
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,828
Where?!

507
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,396
<i>NARRATOR: Where had Aunt
Lily hidden the phone?</i>

508
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:53,532
<i>Well, to answer that, we have to back up a
little bit.</i>

509
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,367
You go on your date.

510
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,070
Happy Valentine's Day.

511
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:59,705
(ringtone playing faintly)

512
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:07,214
(ringtone playing louder)

513
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:09,217
It's Barney's phone.

514
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,253
I wonder how it got in there.

515
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:13,855
Ted?

516
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,324
Come on. Big date.

517
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:18,994
Ah, what's the harm?

518
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,162
Hello?

519
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:22,698
<i>And just like that, I was hooked.</i>

520
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,332
Terrific. I will see you there.

521
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,301
And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer.

522
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:29,871
Oh, I think you'll know the
blazer when you see it.

523
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:31,640
Ooh. I gotta go.

524
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:32,644
Oh, thank God you're here.

525
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:34,776
So... rabbit or duck?

526
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,050
Rabbit. Sorry, guys.

527
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:44,985
I gotta go.

528
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:47,755
<i>Well, hello.</i>

529
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:49,123
(ringtone plays)

530
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:50,791
Sorry, babe. I gotta take this.

531
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,526
Barney's phone.

532
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:53,460
Teddy West Side speaking.

533
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:54,695
<i>It's my phone!</i>

534
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:55,829
I am taking it back!

535
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,331
And I'm taking your cool nickname, too!

536
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:58,532
Barney West Side speaking.

537
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,535
No! I love it so much! It just keeps ringing

538
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:02,037
and ringing and ringing. Hey, baby.

539
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,171
Give it to me. Come on.

540
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,773
Stop. It's mine now.

541
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:05,841
It's not your--

542
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,077
Lily. Ah!

543
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:09,211
(screaming) No!

544
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:10,445
Oops.

545
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:12,815
(scoffs)

546
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:14,483
Being single sucks. Mm.

547
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:16,351
It turns you into a crazy person.

548
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,987
I know.

549
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:20,390
So much running around and
freaking out, and for what?

550
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,057
It's all so you can find someone

551
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:23,492
you can sit on a couch

552
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,127
and put off cleaning the bathroom with.

553
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:26,295
(chuckles)

554
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:28,130
Well, the joke's on the rest of the world,

555
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,965
because we can do that on our own.

556
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,751
Exactly.

557
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:33,145
Exactly.

558
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,984
Hmm.

559
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,692
Robin, I-I have to apologize--

560
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,893
Just save it. Let's just do the news.

561
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,463
No, listen.

562
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,164
After you left the other night,

563
00:19:53,165 --> 00:19:54,532
I was embarrassed.

564
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,800
Not because I was naked.

565
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,601
I'm actually pretty okay with my body.

566
00:19:57,602 --> 00:19:58,635
Clearly.

567
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:00,204
(sighs)

568
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,139
I got married in college.

569
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,474
I just got divorced three months ago.

570
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:06,910
I have no idea how to be single.

571
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:09,246
But that's not why I was embarrassed.

572
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,182
I was embarrassed about my behavior

573
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,784
right here at Channel...

574
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:14,686
Um...

575
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:17,222
It starts with a one.
I know that much. Uh...

576
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:18,858
Twelve. 12! Channel 12.

577
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:20,526
I mean, just look at your mug.

578
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:21,794
Right.

579
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,531
Well, no. You look at this mug.

580
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:25,966
You are a tremendous news anchor.

581
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:29,035
And you deserve a c
o-anchor who gives a crap.

582
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,040
And from here on out, that's gonna be me.

583
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,442
Well, I'll believe that when I see it.

584
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,610
Well, you'll see it right now.

585
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,613
I'll go get you some coffee.

586
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,218
Don...

587
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:45,952
You're wearing pants.

588
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,123
Well, look at that.

589
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:53,393
Ah, duck.

590
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:59,394
