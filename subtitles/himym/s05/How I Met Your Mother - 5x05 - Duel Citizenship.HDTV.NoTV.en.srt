00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,133
<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, as you know,
Aunt Robin grew up in Canada.</i>

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,434
<i>That meant sometimes she
dressed a little differently.</i>

3
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:09,067
Okay, let's do this!

4
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:12,367
<i>Sometimes she talked
a little differently.</i>

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,868
Ted, this hydro bill is bigger
than Louis Cyr's biceps.

6
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:18,000
What, you leave the garburator
on all night, eh?

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,901
<i>She hung out at different bars</i>

8
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>and enjoyed leisure time
a little differently.</i>

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,934
You want to go?
You want to go?! Come on!

10
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:29,167
Make fun of the Great
White North all you want.

11
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,934
It's the best country
in the world.

12
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:32,534
The...
Mmmm.

13
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:33,434
Social experiment.

14
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:40,033
(chanting):
U.S.A., U.S.A.

15
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,534
Okay, okay.
You know what,

16
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:43,701
What does that even prove, okay?

17
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,634
You chant anything,
people will join in.

18
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:49,601
(chanting):
Canada, Canada,

19
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,901
Cana...
Okay, they won't chant anything.

20
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,400
(chanting):
Shrimp fried rice,

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,400
(all chanting):
Shrimp fried rice,
Shrimp fried rice,

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,300
Shrimp fried rice,
Shrimp fried rice...

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,868
Shrimp fried rice--
totally.

24
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,601
Anyway, speaking of food,

25
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,133
Marshall, I've got
so bad news.

26
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,067
Just read online,
Gazzola's is closing.

27
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,133
No!

28
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,334
What's Gazzola's?

29
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:14,901
A filthy mecca of spectacular
if undercooked pizza

30
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,801
located at 316 Kinzie Street,
Chicago, Illinois.

31
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,334
Back in college, Ted and I used
to take these crazy road trips

32
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:21,868
from Connecticut
all the way to Chicago

33
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:22,934
Just for a Gazzola's pizza.

34
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,033
22 hours.

35
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,467
No map.

36
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,133
We'd just jump in
the Fiero and drive.

37
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,667
We were like Lewis and Clark,

38
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,801
if Lewis and Clark peed
in empty soda bottles

39
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:32,801
and had a bong made
out of a cantaloupe.

40
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,334
Man, those Gazzola trips,

41
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:38,100
that's... that's when
we really became bros.

42
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:40,367
Mm. We ate nothing
but jerky.

43
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,300
Drank nothing but Tantrum.

44
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,033
<i>Ah, Tantrum.</i>

45
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:46,334
<i>Tantrum was a soft drink with
the highest caffeine content</i>

46
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:48,601
<i>legally available
over the counter.</i>

47
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:49,734
<i>It was eventually discontinued</i>

48
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,133
<i>after an extensive study
by the FDA.</i>

49
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,234
Oh, man, we went through a whole case 
of Tantrum one trip.

50
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,767
I was color-blind for
two weeks after that.

51
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,934
I think that's the reason
that I pass out

52
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:05,834
when I hear church bells.

53
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,033
It's probably a good thing
they're closing Gazzola's.

54
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,667
Those trips were
brutal, right?

55
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,734
The long hours in the car,
the motion sickness, the smell.

56
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:16,534
So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?
I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.

57
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:19,934
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

58
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:31,367
I am ready to hit the road.

59
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,567
I got baby wipes.

60
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,133
I got a variety of jerky.

61
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,801
I got six cans of Tantrum.

62
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,200
Well, four.

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,534
One burned through the can,
the other one I drank already.

64
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,334
(grunts)
Tantrum!

65
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,868
I am so psyched! Marshall and I

66
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,033
haven't done something, just
the two of us, for so long.

67
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,067
Ever since he got married, he's
turned from an "I"  to a "we."

68
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,100
What do you mean?

69
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
Think about it.

70
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,801
Hey, haven't seen you all week.
How you doing?

71
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,601
We're doing great.

72
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,467
Did you watch the Jets game?

73
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,067
We most certainly did.

74
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,701
How'd things go at the doctor?

75
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:05,934
We no longer have
a hemorrhoid problem.

76
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:08,367
Hmm.

77
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,567
You guys will not believe this.

78
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,534
I've been talking
to my lawyer all morning.

79
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:12,501
You know that guy I have

80
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:13,834
a slight disagreement

81
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,100
with at the Hoser Hut?
He's filing assault charges.

82
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,234
Come on!

83
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,801
I broke his nose with a chair.

84
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:22,067
And now, apparently, I may
end up getting deported.

85
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,667
Oh, my God, that sucks!
Yeah.

86
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm gonna go do push-ups
in the kitchen.

87
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,901
Tantrum!
(grunts)

88
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:30,334
Well, there's only one possible
way to avoid getting deported.

89
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:33,634
My lawyer said I could
become an American citizen.

90
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,734
Perfect. Problem solved.
Welcome aboard.

91
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:37,234
Well, it's not that simple.

92
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,467
I'm a Canadian.
I was born there.

93
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,334
My family's there.
It's who I am.

94
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:44,067
I know, and it's provided us
with a lot of laughs.

95
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,067
But, Robin,

96
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,434
if you want to live here,
work here

97
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:50,534
and throw chairs at people here,
you have to do this.

98
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:53,067
Well, there's a citizenship
test tomorrow.

99
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,133
A cit...
I'll think about it.

100
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,234
No, no, you have to do it.

101
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:57,734
I'll help you study.

102
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,267
We're gonna stay up
all night long.

103
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:01,601
I'm gonna drill you,
and then we're gonna study.

104
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,801
No, seriously.

105
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,901
We're gonna do some cramming

106
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,067
and then we're gonna study.

107
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,467
No, seriously. We're
gonna bone up on...

108
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:08,734
Okay, Barney.
Sorry.

109
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,367
It's a rich area.
It is.

110
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,734
But you know, it's not
going to be easy, this test.

111
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:15,200
It's not like the Canadian
citizenship test.

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,167
How do you know
the Canadian test is easy?

113
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,934
It's Canada.

114
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,734
Question one: Do you want
to be Canadian?

115
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,834
Question two: Really?

116
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,567
Ted! Ted!

117
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:26,868
Check it out!

118
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:29,701
I got black coffee on the left,
I got Tantrum on the right!

119
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:32,133
Do you have a phone book?!
Yes, I do!

120
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,067
I don't know why they make
phone books anymore.

121
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,200
Everything's online, right?

122
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,601
(yelling)

123
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:38,133
Tantrum!
Tantrum!

124
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,234
All right, let's hit the road.

125
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:42,601
You invited Lily?

126
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,033
We most certainly did!

127
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,734
I don't know if you caught that,
but he did the "we" thing.

128
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,767
Yeah, I heard him.
Okay.

129
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,834
Road trip!

130
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,667
So you guys want to talk
about bitches?

131
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,167
I'm kidding.
They're called women.

132
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,834
All right, next stop: Chicago.

133
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,934
I have to pee.

134
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,334
Couldn't you have gone
before we left?

135
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:07,834
I did. I just pee a lot.

136
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,133
You'll see.

137
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,767
Don't worry,
we'll get out on the road,

138
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,100
it'll be just like old times.

139
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,901
<i>It wasn't.</i>

140
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:24,300
* I would walk 500 miles

141
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,834
* And I would walk 500 more...

142
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,267
Sugar snap pea?

143
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,501
Pea...

144
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,300
That reminds me, I have to pee.

145
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,834
Okay, straight,
straight, straight.

146
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,801
Now, wait, a little
to the left.

147
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:41,534
We'll pass a state trooper.

148
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,901
Ooh, punch buggy yellow!

149
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,968
Ow!

150
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,267
Yellow-- that reminds me,
I have to pee.

151
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,167
Thank you!

152
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,434
Great.

153
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:57,434
Oh, hey, Ted...

154
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:58,868
You can't have
to go again.

155
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,334
It's not humanly
possible.

156
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:03,234
No, I was just going to say
maybe we should listen to something.

157
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:06,033
Oh, that's a great idea.
I think I have some Jerky Boys.

158
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,667
<i>Good-bye, Sparky.</i>

159
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,367
It's an audio book
about a boy and his dog.

160
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,367
It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.

161
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:16,200
<i>Good-bye Sparky,
by Nick Leotti.</i>

162
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,033
Read to you by Kenny Rogers.

163
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,167
Oh!

164
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:22,100
Chapter One:
When I first saw Sparky,

165
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,367
he reminded me of
my favorite comb;

166
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,634
he was missing a lot of teeth,
but I loved him anyway.

167
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,367
Mother was fit to be tied

168
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,000
every time he used
her prized rhododendron

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,434
to do his business.

170
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,868
(laughs)

171
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,100
That reminds me,
I have to pee.

172
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,300
"How many stars
are on the flag?"

173
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,868
50-- one for each state.

174
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,501
"What are
the first ten amendments

175
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,534
to the Constitution called?"

176
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:44,834
The Bill of Rights.

177
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,033
Look, Barney, I know
all this. I'm ready.

178
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,133
Ready for the test maybe,
but ready to be an American?

179
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,467
Not on your sweet life.

180
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,267
For you to be an American,

181
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,901
we got to get the Canadian
out of you.

182
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:57,968
That's why I've created
these questions.

183
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:01,100
Question one: "Who is this?"

184
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,167
Queen Elizabeth II.

185
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,567
No, the answer is Elton John.

186
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:08,434
Question two:
"What the hell is this?"

187
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:09,534
Oh, curling.

188
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:10,834
Um, it's a sport played...

189
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,901
Wrong. The answer
we were looking for

190
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,567
was "I don't care, it's dumb."

191
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,400
Let's go buy something
that's bad for us

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,234
and then sue the people
who made it.

193
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:19,467
That's America, Robin.

194
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,868
...because Sparky loved
chasing a ball,

195
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,067
and it didn't much matter
what kind.

196
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:28,267
Tennis ball, baseball,
Wiffle ball,

197
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,267
golf ball, basketball,

198
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,334
beach ball, gum ball,

199
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:34,234
a grapefruit-- which isn't
actually a ball,

200
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:35,667
but 's round like a ball--

201
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,234
a football-- which isn't round,

202
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,634
but it's still technically
a ball--

203
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:40,868
Indian rubber ball...

204
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,901
This ends disk seven.

205
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:47,300
The audio book continues
on disk eight.

206
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,567
Disk eight.

207
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,300
Lacrosse ball, volleyball...

208
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,067
Oh, my God, Lily, please
tell me you have to go pee!

209
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,100
Ah, I do.

210
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,834
<i>It was the worst trip ever,</i>

211
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,234
<i>but then it got worse.</i>

212
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,167
Well, don't worry, the
next exit's the hotel.

213
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,334
We can go there.

214
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,801
Hotel?

215
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,968
<i>WOMAN:
Crumpet Manor is listed</i>

216
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:10,434
in the American Registry
of Historic Bed-and-Breakfasts.

217
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:14,901
Our door is opened
on Christmas day, 1881.

218
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:17,834
And we have catered
to couples ever since.

219
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:21,801
Well, I mean, single people
can have fun here, too, right?

220
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,367
Oh, I suppose I could arrange
a little recreation.

221
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,234
Do you enjoy sitting
on a bench?

222
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,601
And by the end of the night, Barney
had turned Robin into a real American.

223
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,801
I want to say-- Jefferson?

224
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,000
Correct.
Oh!

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,567
Archie Bunker's neighbor
was George Jefferson.

226
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,601
Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this.

227
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:42,767
God, I'm buzzing

228
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,901
On America right now!
All right, hold your horses.

229
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,467
Now to prove that you are
as American as apple pie

230
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,300
and the childhood obesity
it leads to--

231
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,200
who is this?

232
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,567
That, Barney,

233
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:59,501
is the American actor,
beloved by millions,

234
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:03,167
<i>the "Hey, Vern" guy from the
popular series of Ernest films.</i>

235
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,601
And his name...

236
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:08,567
Jeff Foxworthy.

237
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,467
Jeff Foxworthy?

238
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,133
No, it's Jim Varney.

239
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,767
You're kidding me.
You don't know that?

240
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,100
Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy,
dumbass.

241
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,434
End of story.
Now shut your stupid face.

242
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:21,234
Not only are you wrong,

243
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,901
but you are belligerently
sticking to your guns

244
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,868
and insulting me
in the process.

245
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:29,367
Robin Scherbatsky--

246
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,834
you are an American.

247
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:36,467
Look who's back
from the wishing well.

248
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,200
It didn't work,
I'm still here.

249
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,501
Marshall, what are we doing?

250
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:42,801
We should be on the road.

251
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,367
Ok, Ted, we're not
in college anymore, okay?

252
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,901
We don't have
to drive all night.

253
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:50,167
Besides, they have a spa.

254
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,968
All our spa treatments
are designed for couples.

255
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,000
Would you
be interested

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,534
in the two-person,
cornmeal body scrub?

257
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:00,667
<i>And then finally it happened.</i>

258
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,868
<i>Marshall and Lily globbed
into one big married glob.</i>

259
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:07,934
We'd love a cornmeal
body scrub!

260
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,400
Whoa.

261
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,534
I got to dial back
on the Tantrum.

262
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:17,534
<i> Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be
an American, y'all.</i>

263
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:20,634
<i>Maybe I'll rob a liquor store.
Maybe I won't.</i>

264
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:21,834
<i>My choice.</i>

265
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:25,534
Learn English!

266
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,501
<i>The Hoser Hut.</i>

267
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,267
<i>I could duck in for a drink.</i>

268
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:32,734
<i>No, no, that life's behind me.</i>

269
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,501
<i>Forget it.</i>

270
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,033
<i>Well, I could  in
for just one beer.</i>

271
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,300
<i>What's the harm in that?</i>

272
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,634
<i>It's a free country.</i>

273
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:43,000
* O Canada

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,300
* Our home and native land...

275
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,834
Oh, God, I miss it.

276
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,968
* True patriots love...

277
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:54,100
(knocking)

278
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,667
Hey, man.

279
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,200
Shh.

280
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,334
Sorry about
what I said before.

281
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,601
You want to go to the store
and get some beer?

282
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,234
Lily is asleep.

283
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,767
I suppose I could
reschedule my pedicure.

284
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,467
What the hell?
But only light beer

285
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:14,000
because we have a couple
hike in the morning.

286
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,467
Dude, why are we pulling
to the highway?

287
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,667
Ted, where exactly
are we going to get this beer?

288
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,133
Chicago.

289
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,000
What are you doing?
We can't just leave Lily.

290
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,334
When she wakes up,
she's going to freak!

291
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:36,234
She'll have a back rub
and a crumpet.

292
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:39,267
She'll be fine.
Relax. Have some fun.

293
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,367
I just abandoned my wife.

294
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,434
How am I supposed to have fun?

295
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,834
* And I would walk 500 miles

296
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:50,667
* And I would walk 500 more...

297
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,667
Hey, you really think
Lily's pissed?

298
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,334
If she's pissed, she's pissed.

299
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,801
Pfft.

300
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,200
<i>NARRATOR:
When Barney finally</i>

301
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
<i>tracked down your Aunt Robin,</i>

302
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,501
<i>it wasn't a pretty sight.</i>

303
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,267
Good morning.

304
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,534
(moans)

305
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:04,667
Barney?

306
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:08,267
Oh, my God.
What happened last night?

307
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,133
You went Canadian.

308
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,267
How Canadian?

309
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,267
This Canadian.

310
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh. That was supposed
to be a dramatic view

311
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,167
of the Toronto sky--
you're in Toronto.

312
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,534
Oh, God.

313
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:29,467
Okay. It's coming back to me.

314
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:32,267
I, uh, I went
into the Hoser Hut..

315
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:33,467
(sighs)

316
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:36,400
And I met this
women's curling team

317
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,067
<i>ROBIN:
We started drinking.</i>

318
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,000
<i>And the next thing I know,
they're inviting me</i>

319
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,467
<i>to a Bryan Adams/Rich tittle
double bill in Toronto.</i>

320
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,868
How did you find me, anyway?

321
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,167
You called me,
said you were never coming back.

322
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,167
So, I jumped on a plane,
flew across the Atlantic...

323
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,200
Canada isn't
across the Atlantic.

324
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,501
You're talking nonsense.

325
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,033
Now, listen...

326
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:58,300
You slipped up. It's fine.

327
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,634
The test is in a few hours.

328
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,000
Barney,
I'm not taking the test.

329
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,501
God, you're still drunk.

330
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:04,701
(sighs)

331
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,834
Look, I-I appreciate
your help, but...

332
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,734
who am I kidding?
I'm Canadian.

333
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,200
I always will be.

334
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,868
Now, that's ridiculous.

335
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:17,033
We're gonna get some coffee
In you, we'll sober you up,

336
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,200
and get you back
to New York for that test.

337
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,167
But, before any of that,

338
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,467
we're gonna do it on this bed

339
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,033
'cause... hotel room.

340
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,200
Okay, let's get some coffee.

341
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,033
Kind of gross.
You're making me wonder

342
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,467
if this pizza is worth
the 22-hour drive.

343
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,400
Just like old times!

344
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,801
I feel so young again
except for the chest pains.

345
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,901
But the crust is so good.

346
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:44,567
What is the secret
to this crust?

347
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,033
It's no big secret.

348
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,334
It's made of cornmeal.

349
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:49,601
Cornmeal...

350
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:54,300
We'd love a
cornmeal body scrub!

351
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,400
I can't believe
you guys are closing.

352
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,634
I can't believe
we're still open.

353
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:01,100
Gotcha!

354
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,334
These are getting bigger.

355
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:07,767
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.

356
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,267
Yeah, give me
two coffees.

357
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,901
$3.50, please.

358
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,834
Hey, what did you think of
the game last night?

359
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:14,901
What game?

360
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,467
The Leafs beat Edmonton.

361
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,968
Beauchemin went five hole in OT.

362
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,501
Oh, I guess I missed it.

363
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,100
Oh, sorry. You're American.

364
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,701
Here's your change.

365
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:24,767
I'm not American.

366
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,968
American money?

367
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,200
Didn't watch the Leafs game?

368
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,300
No "please" or "thank you"
for the coffee?

369
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,367
You sure don't seem
like a Canadian.

370
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,667
What's wrong?
Other than the fact

371
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,567
that this five-dollar bill
they gave you is blue.

372
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,801
Wow. I'm not American,

373
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,834
and apparently,
I'm not Canadian either.

374
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:47,367
And there's kids
playing hokey on the back.

375
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:52,200
It's like you want us
to make fun of you.

376
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,601
I don't want this anymore.

377
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,133
Dude, don't look at it.
That's a rookie mistake.

378
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,501
We shouldn't have left Lily.

379
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,501
Well, if you're so worried,

380
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,634
why don't you give her a call?

381
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,467
I have.
I left her, like, 20 messages.

382
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,901
I said, "I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

383
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,000
It's all Ted's fault!"

384
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,467
What exactly is "Ted's fault"?

385
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:10,734
This! This whole thing!

386
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,000
We were having
a perfectly nice trip,

387
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,167
and then you kidnapped me.

388
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,567
You didn't even let me
put on underwear!

389
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,767
We never used to
put on underwear!

390
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:21,634
That was the fun of a
bro's trip to Gazzola's!

391
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:24,234
We left everything,
and everyone behind.

392
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:25,534
It was just you and me!

393
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:28,734
But now it's like you've
disappeared into Lily.

394
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:29,734
That is not true.

395
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,267
It is true. You're not upset

396
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,734
because you're worried she's
mad. You're upset because

397
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,267
you'd rather be with her,
eating muffins

398
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,567
than here with me,
eating this delicious...

399
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,901
I think one of my mushrooms
just crawled away.

400
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:41,334
Well, you know what?

401
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:44,234
That mushroom's not the only
thing that's leaving.

402
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,100
Car keys, please.

403
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,767
Look at this money!

404
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,501
This one has a moose,
this one has a beaver,

405
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,601
and they all have
Elton John on the back.

406
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,601
When I moved to the States,

407
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,667
I swore to myself,
I wasn't going to change.

408
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:17,667
And yet, here I am, in the most
Canadian place in the universe--

409
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:20,634
Tim Horton's-- around the corner
from the Hockey Hall of Fame,

410
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:23,167
and I don't belong.

411
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,367
It's like I don't
have a country.

412
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,934
Okay, that's it.

413
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,634
Attention, Canada!

414
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,434
I am Barney from America.

415
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,100
And I'm here to fix
your backward-ass country.

416
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,634
Number one: get real money.

417
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:42,934
Don't know what board game this
came from, but it's a "jhoke."

418
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:46,701
Number two--
and this is the biggie--

419
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:50,067
Quit letting awesome chicks like
Robin Scherbatsky get away

420
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,434
because, guess what?

421
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,968
You don't want her?
I'm planting my flag in her--

422
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:56,267
if you know what I mean,
which you probably don't--

423
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,367
and getting her
the hell out of here.

424
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:01,334
You may now return
to being pointless.

425
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,334
<i>Ah, this coffee is excellent.</i>

426
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,968
Oh. Hey, fellas.

427
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,501
It's called a "tie."

428
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:32,667
Sparky was my best friend,
but after I married Helen,

429
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:36,934
old Spark started to feel
a little left out.

430
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:39,601
For so long,
it had been just me and him,

431
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,200
but now he suddenly felt
like Helen had taken his place.

432
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,467
What Sparky didn't realize was,
even though I loved Helen,

433
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,334
I still loved him, too.

434
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,067
I had room in my heart
for both of them.

435
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,000
But maybe
I should have put aside

436
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,801
some special ball-tossing time
just for the two of us

437
00:17:56,801 --> 00:18:00,701
to make sure Sparky knew
that he was a good boy.

438
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:02,634
I wish now I had,

439
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:05,334
'cause old Sparky ran out
in front of a Cadillac

440
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,567
and got splattered
like a watermelon

441
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,567
in one of them Gallagher shows.

442
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,300
I'm sorry, Ted!
I'm sorry!

443
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,367
No, I'm sorry.

444
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:13,501
I never should have
been mad at you!

445
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,701
No, I never should
have brought Lily.

446
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:17,467
She pees all the time,
even at the apartment.

447
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,901
Still bros?

448
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,834
Best bros.

449
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:26,167
Hey, you want to crank some
Van Halen just like old times?

450
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,100
Hells, yeah!

451
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,400
Or listen to the
Sparky book again?

452
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,801
Listen to the
Sparky book again.

453
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:31,934
Okay. Let's listen
to it again.

454
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:36,067
Man, those Canadian
doctors banded me up,

455
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:39,801
reset my jaw, put my shoulder
back in its socket,

456
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,267
and they didn't even bill me.
Idiots.

457
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,067
All right,
I guess they're not idiots.

458
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:47,767
The coffee was extraordinary.

459
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,834
Huh.

460
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,334
I guess Canada's not so bad.

461
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,400
They play their cards right,

462
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,467
maybe they can even
become a state someday.

463
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,601
Barney, I've thought about this.

464
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,667
When you stood up and
told off those people,

465
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:05,434
I thought, "Yeah, America's cool."
Hmm.

466
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:08,033
And then when those guys
pounded the stuffing out of you,

467
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:13,501
I thought, "Yeah, Canada's
pretty cool, too."

468
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:16,100
I-I may have taken
a few pokes myself.

469
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:19,567
So, I've decided,
dual citizenship.

470
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,701
I'm going
to be American and Canadian.

471
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:23,601
Wait, you can do that?

472
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:24,868
Yeah, dummy.

473
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:26,701
Instead of being a woman
with no country,

474
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,868
I'm going to be
a woman with two.

475
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,701
I see.

476
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,067
You understand?

477
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:35,467
No, I can see out
of my left eye again.

478
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,033
Hey, baby?

479
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,400
Baby?

480
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,734
Hmm? Yeah?

481
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,801
I'm so sorry
that we left you.

482
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:54,133
Did you go somewhere, sweetie?

483
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:59,567
<i>Yes, kids, it turns out
Crumpet Manor</i>

484
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,968
<i>had pampered Lily into a nearly
comatose state of relaxation.</i>

485
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,234
<i>She didn't even notice
we were gone.</i>

486
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:07,767
(phone buzzes)

487
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,367
(in same register as phone):
Mmm....

488
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,934
(phone buzzes)

489
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:14,634
...

490
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:15,701
(staccato):
Oh, oh, oh...

491
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:18,200
(phone buzzes)
Yeah...

492
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,434
So, I had a great time, too.

493
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:21,601
That's good.

494
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,868
And I'm so sorry you
didn't get any pizza.

495
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh, that's okay.

496
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,567
<i>And if she didn't mean it then,</i>

497
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:29,100
<i>she certainly meant it
19 minutes later.</i>

498
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,267
God, my stomach!

499
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:33,467
Damn you, Gozzola's!
(straining)

500
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:36,400
It's like a hot ball of lead!

501
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Baby, cut it out of me.

502
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,367
That was a wild
trip, huh, Ted?

503
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,667
I know. It was
kind of crazy.

504
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,934
But how great is it
to drink some Tantrum again?

505
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,634
You know who had
fun, was Lily.

506
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:51,834
Lily drank like, four
cans of the stuff.

507
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:52,901
Right, Lil?

508
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,367
Where's Lily?

509
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,601
Tantrum!

510
00:20:56,601 --> 00:20:58,801
I have to pee.
