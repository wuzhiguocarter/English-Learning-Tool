1
00:00:01,217 --> 00:00:03,551
Guess what I've got
behind my back.

2
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:06,121
Wait, wait, wait,
I got this one. Left.

3
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:08,323
Wrong game. But correct.

4
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:12,793
<i>Five front-row tickets
to Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

5
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:14,194
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

6
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:15,362
That is awesome!

7
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:16,998
<i>You've heard of
Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

8
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,466
Never. But we assume it's
some sort of sporting event

9
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,636
That pits robots
against wrestlers!

10
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:22,970
That's exactly what it is,

11
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:24,404
According to the Web site!

12
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:27,842
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:30,143
Who's the fifth ticket for?

14
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:32,145
Uh... Robin.

15
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:33,146
I know--

16
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,648
She moved in with her boyfriend

17
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,950
And said she doesn't want
to hang out with us anymore,

18
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:39,185
<i>But this is Robots
vs. Wrestlers.</i>

19
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,420
<i>Robots...</i>

20
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,789
<i>Vs. Wrestlers!</i>

21
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,124
Barney is right.

22
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,324
It's impossible
to say no to that.

23
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:47,325
No to that.

24
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:48,694
I wish I could, but I

25
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:50,195
Have plans with don on Saturday.

26
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,429
He's making me Chinese.

27
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,098
I'll assume you're
talking about food,

28
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:55,467
Otherwise, I have some
follow-up questions.

29
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:56,702
Oh, I'm sorry, Lily,

30
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:59,004
But I got to give this thing
with don a chance.

31
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,505
And I can't do that if I'm out
drinking with you guys

32
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,307
Every single night--
especially when "you guys"

33
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:05,209
Includes two
of my ex-boyfriends.

34
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,944
I understand.
You're right.

35
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:09,714
It's just we
all really miss you.

36
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:11,215
Aw, I miss you, too.

37
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:13,317
Oh, listen, I got to go.
Talk soon?

38
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:14,618
Okay, bye.

39
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:17,387
Sorry, New York,
I had to take that.

40
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:18,755
Now, where were we?

41
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:21,658
Yeah. Yes. Bus crash.

42
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,326
She said no?

43
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:25,095
How could she say no?

44
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:27,397
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers
is our most important tradition</i>

45
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:28,799
As a group.

46
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,234
Tradition? We've never
done this before?

47
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,268
<i>It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily.</i>

48
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:35,738
How is that not
gonna be a tradition?

49
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,739
Well...

50
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,273
This is how it starts.

51
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:40,542
First Robin moves in with don,

52
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,477
Then Marshall and Lily
have a baby,

53
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:43,545
Then Ted...

54
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:44,546
Gets married?

55
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:46,481
I was gonna say,
"is found alone

56
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,450
In his apartment
devoured by his cats,"

57
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,018
But either way, not pretty.

58
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:51,019
Everyone's

59
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,954
Leaving me,
and I don't like it!

60
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,889
Oh, Barney, you
don't have to worry

61
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,524
About Marshall
and me having kids.

62
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:58,593
<i>That's a long way
down the road.</i>

63
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:00,228
Exactly-- it's,
uh, down the road,

64
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,429
A medium way.

65
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,331
A medium-long way.

66
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,932
I mean, you can see it ahead.

67
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:07,201
In the vast, vast distance.

68
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:08,869
But you're already seeing
exit signs for it.

69
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,237
Really? I didn't see any.

70
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:13,173
You might want to get
in the right lane.

71
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,908
I understand
how you feel, Barney.

72
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,777
Friendships are important.

73
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,779
In fact, Emerson wrote

74
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,180
A great poem entitled
"friendship."

75
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:23,015
You guys are gonna love this.

76
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:26,853
"a ruddy drop of manly blood,
the surging sea outweighs..."

77
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:31,523
<i>That's how it had
always been for me with the gang</i>

78
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:33,860
<i>Any time I tried to get
a little high-minded.</i>

79
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,462
You guys, you've got
to try this syrah.

80
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:39,231
Hints of creme de cassis,
red berries,

81
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,732
Toasty oak...

82
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,103
Hmm.

83
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:48,673
Five letters, blank baritone.

84
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,942
Of course! Lyric baritone!

85
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:53,778
Which is actually higher
than a dramatic baritone.

86
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,212
You know, there's
a telling moment

87
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,914
<i>In the second act
of la bohème...</i>

88
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,285
Guys, come on, I'm
just trying to add

89
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:02,753
A little class to
these proceedings.

90
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,054
It's like that line

91
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:05,222
<i>From Dante's inferno.</i>

92
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:10,226
You were not born
to live like brutes."

93
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:14,230
"but to follow virtue
and knowledge""

94
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,266
Or...

95
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,901
In the original Italian...

96
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:35,643
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

97
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:39,254
You guys are right.

98
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:40,722
I'm totally overreacting

99
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,323
To this whole Robin thing.

100
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,325
What's this envelope?
Is this a wedding invitation?

101
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:46,160
Robin's marrying don.
I'm gonna die alone!

102
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:48,129
Ted's gonna get eaten by cats!

103
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,130
Dude,

104
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,132
Relax-- it's for Marissa Heller.

105
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,067
Marissa Heller?
She sounds hot.

106
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:55,002
Face, boobs, describe.

107
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,103
Start with boobs.

108
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:58,271
<i>Who was Marissa Heller?</i>

109
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,207
<i>That mystery began
when Marshall and I</i>

110
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,541
<i>First moved in together.</i>

111
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,377
Ted! We got our
first mail delivery!

112
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,079
We are popular.

113
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,347
We've got

114
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,082
A golf magazine for...

115
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,383
Marissa Heller,

116
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,652
We've got a wicker
furniture catalog,

117
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,053
Also for Marissa Heller,

118
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,487
And...

119
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,990
A coupon for a bird store...

120
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,993
Addressed to Marissa Heller or--
stay with me--

121
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,794
"current occupant."

122
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,996
That's us!

123
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,031
We've got mail!
Fantastic!

124
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,466
Marissa Heller?

125
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,367
She must be the woman
who lived here before us.

126
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,736
I wonder what she was like.

127
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,171
<i>And just like that,</i>

128
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,540
<i>A picture began
to take shape...</i>

129
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,610
<i>A picture of Marissa Heller,
the golfer...</i>

130
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,750
<i>...Marissa Heller,
the wicker catalog shopper...</i>

131
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,552
<i>Marissa Heller,
the bird owner.</i>

132
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,690
And since then, with each
piece of mail we've gotten,

133
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:55,392
The picture's become
a little clearer.

134
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:56,493
The only thing

135
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:58,362
We don't know is
what she looks like.

136
00:04:58,363 --> 00:04:59,963
Well, I guess
I'll forward this along

137
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:00,997
Like I've been forwarding...

138
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:03,432
Oh, just open it.
Okay.

139
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,336
It's an invitation
to Jefferson van Smoot's

140
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:10,106
Annual spring social
this Saturday night...

141
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:11,941
In the penthouse apartment
of the Alberta!

142
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:14,310
You guys... That's the most
beautiful building in Manhattan!

143
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,345
We-we got to go
to this party.

144
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,613
That depends-- does it say
anything on that invitation

145
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:21,716
About robots battling wrestlers
for intergalactic supremacy?

146
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:23,251
No, but it says open bar.

147
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:25,520
Revised agenda

148
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,422
Free booze
at Marissa Heller's party,

149
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,957
<i>Then Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

150
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,025
One of us just

151
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:33,727
Needs to pretend
to be Marissa Heller.

152
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:37,031
guys, I'm flattered,

153
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,999
But I think Lily should do it.

154
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,936
<i>So the big night arrived.</i>

155
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,870
<i>Our first stop...</i>

156
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,806
<i>The Alberta building.</i>

157
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,808
Wow! This building is amazing!

158
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,708
Did you guys see
the Porte Cochere

159
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,044
And the Terra-cotta
spandrels outside?

160
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,211
Oh, my God, look!

161
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,080
I just got a text from Robin.

162
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:55,148
It says...

163
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,784
Okay, guys, huddle up.

164
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,287
Now, Lil, you can do
this-- all you have to do

165
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,756
Is look that guy in the eye,
say your name

166
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:05,490
Is Marissa Heller,
and we are golden.

167
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,492
And again, just so
we're clear, no accent.

168
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,162
Are we sure
she's not British, isn't it?

169
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:11,463
No! No!
No!

170
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:13,098
All right! Here I go.

171
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:14,566
I'm doing it.

172
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,733
Hi.
Hello.

173
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:16,801
Ooh. Sorry.

174
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:17,936
Go ahead.

175
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:20,072
I'm here for
the van Smoot party.

176
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:22,673
My name is Marissa Heller.

177
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,977
Bollocks.

178
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,955
So that's Marissa Heller.

179
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,323
Huh.

180
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:35,025
<i>She fine.</i>

181
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:37,560
Her teeth look really nice.

182
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,628
She must be remembering
to go to the dentist

183
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,263
Even without those
reminder postcards.

184
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:42,699
So, what are we doing?

185
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,302
I'm getting us into
the party, that's what!

186
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:47,904
Marissa Heller!

187
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:49,238
Barney Stinson!

188
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,140
We met at that gathering for...

189
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:52,708
Bird owners.

190
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:54,275
I don't think so.

191
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:55,276
Wicker lovers?

192
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,112
No.
Stinson out.

193
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:59,380
Guys, it's not gonna happen.

194
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:00,782
I got this.

195
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,121
You know, this elevator
still uses the same mechanism

196
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:08,556
From when it was first
installed in 1906.

197
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:09,556
Rumor is,

198
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:10,825
Louis Lamar Skolnick,

199
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:12,593
The architect who
designed this building,

200
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:14,161
Carved these panels himself.

201
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:15,730
Oh, a Skolnick fan?

202
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:16,997
Well...
I love

203
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,199
His juxtaposition between

204
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,067
The north German
renaissance exterior...

205
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,970
And the decidedly French
influence on the inside! I know!

206
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:23,971
He was an architect

207
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:26,272
With the soul of a poet, really.

208
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:27,907
No, no, no, don't, don't.

209
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:29,408
- It's working.
- You know,

210
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,476
I have a confession to make.

211
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:32,045
We're not on the guest list,

212
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:35,381
But... I've always wanted to see
the inside of the Alberta.

213
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,751
Well, then right this way.

214
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:40,153
We're all together.

215
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:44,289
Told you I'd get us in.

216
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,026
So...

217
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:50,995
<i>Anyone been watching
the young and the restless?</i>

218
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,165
awesome!

219
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,635
<i>Who ordered
soap opera illustrated?</i>

220
00:07:56,636 --> 00:08:00,705
Huh. Marissa Heller,
I like your style.

221
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:05,310
Anyone?

222
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:08,211
Am I to understand
that there isn't

223
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:12,283
A single soap opera fan
in this entire elevator, Hmm?

224
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,017
I don't own a TV.

225
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,886
The only operas I watch

226
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:18,689
Are at the met.

227
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,795
Dibs.

228
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,198
Ah. Excuse me.

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,267
Jefferson, darling.

230
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,873
Wow, I am not dressed for this.

231
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:40,709
One word, made up:

232
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,544
"douche-pocalypse""

233
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,979
Guys... That's
Peter Bogdanovich

234
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,349
Talking to Arianna Huffington
and Will Shortz,

235
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,484
Editor of the new
York times crossword!

236
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:51,486
Look, let's give
this party a chance, okay?

237
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:52,754
There's free food, free booze.

238
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,823
20 minutes, then we can leave.

239
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,692
But, you see,
music was changing,

240
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:00,127
And Giovanni Artusi
simply didn't understand

241
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:02,496
The new style of composing.

242
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:04,965
Excuse me, are you
talking about Monteverdi

243
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,867
<i>And his fourth book
of madrigals?</i>

244
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,502
My dear chap, what else?

245
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:11,738
That's my favorite
book of madrigals!

246
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,341
Smoked Foie gras

247
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:17,344
With caramelized mango
and crème fraîche?

248
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:18,778
Hey, uh, hey, guy,

249
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,080
Do you have anything in the
mini cheeseburger department?

250
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,850
I don't think so, sir.

251
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,852
No? Mini pizzas?
Little cups of fries?

252
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:28,721
Any food at all that'll
make me feel like a giant?

253
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,789
I'll check, sir.

254
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:36,061
He's not gonna check.

255
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:37,529
I'm performing
open-heart surgery

256
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,665
On the dutch ambassador
in the morning.

257
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,633
I hope he pulls through.

258
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:44,535
Really? A colleague of mine
just prescribed cumadin

259
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,036
To the dutch ambassador.

260
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:47,071
And there's no way

261
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:48,606
<i>She'd be on anticoagulants</i>

262
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:51,075
<i>If she were about
to undergo surgery.</i>

263
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,111
Just...

264
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:55,312
Okay?

265
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,382
You know who published
a great article

266
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,550
On Walt Whitman
and the politics of semantics?

267
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,252
Professor Hammersmith of Oxford.

268
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:04,388
<i>I am Professor Hammersmith.</i>

269
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,757
Wha...?!

270
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:09,058
...Which is exactly what
truffaut was talking about

271
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,662
<i>In his 1954 article
in Cahiers Du Cinéma.</i>

272
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:15,964
Film is an auteur's
medium, full stop.

273
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:18,734
Movies...

274
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:20,068
Right?

275
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,537
Actors.

276
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:25,073
Willem Dafoe.

277
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,975
Funny thing
about Willem Dafoe--

278
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:30,779
Uh, his name kind of
sounds like a frog...

279
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,180
Talking to a parrot.

280
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,582
Willem.

281
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,418
Defoe!

282
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,585
Willem.

283
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,788
Defoe!

284
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:41,790
No?

285
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,859
As undersecretary
of the treasury,

286
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,761
I had a big hand in crafting
that legislation.

287
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:49,596
Now... I wonder

288
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:51,965
If you'd like to join me
in the map room

289
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:55,268
<i>And give my package
some stimulus.</i>

290
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:56,770
I'm afraid not, darling.

291
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,139
You are too old for my taste.

292
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:03,208
Okay, Zsa Zsa Gabor is still
looking pretty hot,

293
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:04,444
But otherwise,

294
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:05,611
This party sucks.

295
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:07,079
Yeah, well, we
gave it a chance.

296
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,948
It's been 20 minutes.
Let's get out of here.

297
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,182
Where's Ted?
Yeah.

298
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:12,485
I know how to find him.

299
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,321
Just give me one...
Mm.

300
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,928
Gongs, right?

301
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,729
Uh, louder than you think.

302
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,067
Young man, that gong
is a 500-year-old relic

303
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:32,871
That hasn't been struck
since W.S. Gilbert hit it

304
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:36,373
<i>At the London premiere
of the Mikado in 1885.</i>

305
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:40,817
Wife is a 500 year relic that

306
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,527
hasn't been struck since W.S. Gilbert  hit it

307
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,537
at the London premiere 
of the Mikado in 1885.

308
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:48,251
Guys, Will Schorz, editor 
of the Times' crossword.

309
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:50,454
You know how I've been
saying they always use ulee

310
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,021
<i>From Ulee's gold
because of the vowels?</i>

311
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,356
Well, tell 'em,
will. Tell 'em.

312
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:54,524
It's because of the vowels.

313
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:55,758
It's because of the vowels!

314
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,227
Oh, wow. Ted, can I talk
to you just for a second?

315
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:01,230
Hey, will, ten-letter-word for
diminutive egg-based torte?

316
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:02,398
Mini-quiche? Where?!

317
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,400
Right there.

318
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,268
Such a great party. Such a

319
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,370
Great party! Yeah, totally, Ted.
It's time to go.

320
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:10,205
<i>It's Robots
vs. Wrestlers o'clock.</i>

321
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:11,206
Oh.
Ted.

322
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:12,574
There you are.

323
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:15,176
We'll be blind taste-testing
French whites in a bit.

324
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:16,879
Should be a hoot and a half.

325
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,615
Well, I decan't miss that.

326
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,451
I know.
You don't have to say it.

327
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,220
You don't decant white wine.

328
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:29,957
Miss Lily in the living
room with the candlestick.

329
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,192
Oh, my heavens, no!

330
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:34,128
That was Edgar Allan Poe's!

331
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,263
Sorry!

332
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,298
Uh, guys, listen,
I'm having fun here,

333
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,300
<i>So I think I'm gonna skip
Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

334
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,906
But Ted, you've never missed
Robots vs. Wrestlers!

335
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,643
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!

336
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,878
No! No! No! No! No!

337
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,047
Ted, this isn't happening.

338
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:56,314
First Robin ditches us,
and now you?

339
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:59,117
And for these stuffy,
pretentious snoots?!

340
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:01,286
Actually, I kind of like these
stuffy, pretentious snoots.

341
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,956
They don't make fart noises
every time I open my mouth.

342
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,391
Now, look, I'm going to stay.

343
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:07,760
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Yeah.

344
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:09,061
Come on, Barney.
It's just one night.

345
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:10,228
It doesn't mean anything.

346
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:11,729
Oh, it means everything.

347
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,033
<i>Ted, if you don't come
to Robots vs. Wrestlers,</i>

348
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,101
It's the end of our friendship.

349
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:19,571
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

350
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:24,075
Fine. Then you are out
of our gang forever.

351
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:26,410
You can reapply in two years.

352
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,679
Marshall, Lily,

353
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,313
Let's go watch

354
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,549
Wrestlers fight robots.

355
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:36,086
So embarrassing.

356
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,554
I forgot something.

357
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:53,457
So Ted, where did those chums
of yours scoot off to?

358
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,258
Oh, you know.

359
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,593
Poetry reading.

360
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:03,266
Best tradition ever!

361
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:05,001
Don't humor me, Marshall.

362
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:06,269
Let's face it.

363
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,171
The gang is over.

364
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,705
Ted's gone. Robin's gone.

365
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,573
We might as well just go
our separate ways.

366
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,509
God, Barney, enough
with t a abandonment issues.

367
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,245
Ted's allowed to have a life
outside of the group.

368
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,579
We all are.

369
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,314
Wait a minute.

370
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,916
Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

371
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,952
Oh, God, you're pregnant!

372
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:25,020
No.

373
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:28,389
Oh, God, you
already had the baby!

374
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,625
It's right behind me, isn't it?

375
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:31,992
No, you idiot.

376
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:34,228
It's just, eventually,
we're all gonna move on.

377
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:36,631
It's called growing up.

378
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:39,900
Is that all you got, bitch?

379
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,335
But can you at least promise me

380
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:42,935
That you won't get pregnant
for another year?

381
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,304
I can't make that promise.

382
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:46,906
You can't?!
You can't?!

383
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:52,646
Hmm?

384
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:58,284
Citrus and honeycomb flavors
with crisp acidity.

385
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:01,320
It's a sauv blanc, Loire valley.

386
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:03,088
Town of Sancerre.

387
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,956
Ah. Correct again!

388
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:06,392
Bravo, boy!

389
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,729
No! You can't
have kids!

390
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,398
You don't want to bring a child

391
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,732
Into this crazy,
messed-up world.

392
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:14,899
I don't know.

393
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,234
The world seems pretty awesome
right now, Barney.

394
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,005
Okay, Lily,
you leave me no choice.

395
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:23,808
If you have a daughter, the day,

396
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,078
Nay, the minute she turns 18...

397
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,146
Gong!
Oh, my God!

398
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:30,780
Hey, but Lily.

399
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:34,284
Lily... Babies.

400
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,686
Oh!

401
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:39,089
I hope
Ted is miserable right now.

402

Ted, your lyric baritone
is outstanding.

408
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:07,148
Thank you, Will Shortz.

409
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:11,119
Fine, you guys can have a baby,

410
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,791
1) you promise to always
love me more than the baby;

411
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:20,794
2) once a month, I get to use
the baby to pick up chicks;

412
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:23,664
3) that may involve
the baby falling

413
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:26,032
From a two-story window
and me heroically catching it;

414
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,236
4) no breastfeeding
in front of me;

415
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,904
5) forget about four.

416
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:32,573
You can whip them out
whenever you want.

417
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,308
<i>And then, something
amazing happened.</i>

418
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:39,512
Holy crap!

419
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:40,513
I don't believe it.

420
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:45,518
Well, of course, hell is an
interesting concept, isn't it?

421
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,021
I've always loved to imagine it

422
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:50,757
<i>As Dante did in
the divine comedy.</i>

423
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,224
If you'll allow me.

424
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,493
In the original Italian.

425
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:06,405
<i>I cannot believe this.</i>

426
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:08,372
<i>I'm reciting
the divine comedy</i>

427
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,175
<i>In its original Italian,</i>

428
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:12,277
<i>And nobody's making
fart noises!</i>

429
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,015
<i>Wow, this is weird.</i>

430
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,216
<i>Never gotten this far.</i>

431
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:22,687
<i>You know, I actually sound
kind of douchey.</i>

432
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:27,757
<i>My God, I'm out of control!</i>

433
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:30,027
<i>Listen to me.
I'm completely unleashed.</i>

434
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,562
<i>I'm the biggest douche
on the planet.</i>

435
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:42,338
<i>Ugh! I wish
somebody would stop me.</i>

436
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,540
<i>And then, somebody did.</i>

437
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:50,779
<i>Kids, I think I told you
how earlier that year,</i>

438
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,782
<i>We had seen some doppelgangers
of ourselves around town.</i>

439
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,617
<i>There was lesbian Robin.</i>

440
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:01,156
<i>There was moustache Marshall.</i>

441
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:03,458
<i>And, of course, stripper Lily.

442
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,594
<i>Well, that night,</i>

443
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,796
<i>One more doppelganger
surfaced--</i>

444
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,665
<i>Mexican wrestler Ted.</i>

445
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:16,270
<i>Soy el conquistador
de las máquinas!</i>

446
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,438
Oh!

447
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:20,474
Oh!

448
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,349
I got to go.

449
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,588
Rule number 83.

450
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:37,590
If anything
that comes out of that baby

451
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,693
Gets on one of my suits,
I get to touch Lily's boobs.

452
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,429
Dude, what is it with you
and my wife's boobs tonight?

453
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,131
Hey, hey,
I don't make the rules.

454
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:50,436
Baby, are you really starting
to think about this?

455
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:51,970
I don't know.

456
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,606
Maybe a little.

457
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,140
Okay.

458
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:57,610
Well, for whatever it's worth,
I think that we're ready.

459
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:58,677
I mean, look,

460
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:00,177
We love each other,

461
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:02,046
We're financially stable,
and honestly, I don't think

462
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:03,915
It would change our lifestyle
all that much.

463
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,216
<i>Aunt Lily still likes</i>

464
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,051
<i>To remind Uncle Marshall
he once said this.</i>

465
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:09,454
Marshall, if we were at home
with a baby tonight,

466
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:11,155
We never would have seen
Ted's doppelganger.

467
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:12,223
Imagine missing that.

468
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:13,691
How would that feel?

469
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,126
I would blame that child
for the rest of his life.

470
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,495
Exactly.
For the rest of her life.

471
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:21,765
Okay, you're right.

472
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:22,999
There's, there's no hurry.

473
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,868
Okay, how about this?

474
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,270
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby

475
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,473
Until we've seen
all five doppelgangers, right?

476
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:31,474
Of course. Stands to reason.

477
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,776
Okay, so when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,

478
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:36,178
That's the universe
telling us it's go time.

479
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,148
And that's when
we'll start trying. Deal?

480
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:41,116
Deal.

481
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:43,853
Hey, guys.
Hey.

482
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:45,387
Well, well, look who thinks

483
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:47,056
He can just waltz in here

484
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:48,924
And be part of the gang again.

485
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:50,391
Well, you can forget it.

486
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:51,993
Listen, Barney, I...

487
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:53,495
Please be part
of the gang again!

488
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,063
I don't want
to lose anyone else!

489
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:56,565
We're all really sorry.

490
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,967
We'll even let you recite
all the douchey poems you want,

491
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:01,703
And we'll never, never say
a bad thing about it, I promise.

492
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:03,371
Really? Because

493
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,372
There actually is a poem
I'd like to recite--

494
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:08,241
"friendship" by
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

495
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:11,912
"a ruddy drop of manly blood,
the surging sea outweighs.

496
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,581
The world uncertain
comes and goes..""

497
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:18,686
I'm sorry.
Someone had to do that.

498
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:20,720
Who wants another drink?
I'm buying.

499
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,490
<i>Kids, I'd love to
tell you that over e e years,</i>

500
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:25,257
<i>We didn't all drift apart
a little</i>

501
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,626
<i>At one time or another.</i>

502
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:29,362
<i>You don't mean
for it to happen, but it does.</i>

503
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,764
<i>But no matter what,
to this day,</i>

504
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,733
<i>Come hell or high water,</i>

505
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,201
<i>We still all get together
every year</i>

506
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,269
<i>For Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

507
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:45,671
Good night! Thanks a lot.
I had a great time.

508
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:52,976
Willem.

509
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:54,143
