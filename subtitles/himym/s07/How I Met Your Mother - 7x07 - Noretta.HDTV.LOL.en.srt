NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2011,</i>

2
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:04,532
<i>all of my friends</i>
<i>were in relationships.</i>

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,738
So when Barney's brother James
<i>came to visit,</i>

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,274
<i>it created</i>
<i>a slight logistical problem.</i>

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,228
We're gonna need a bigger booth.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm gonna go
to the loo.

7
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,281
I don't actually
have to go,

8
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,283
I just want a seat
all to myself.

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,922
So, would anyone care
to ask me where

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,624
Nora and I are
going tonight?

11
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,092
Don't ask him.
It's a trap.

12
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,595
- Where you going?
- Come on, man, for God's sake!

13
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,964
Bootytown, Kevin!

14
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,748
We are finally going
to Bootytown.

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,934
And that's why
we don't ask him.

16
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,971
I'm thinking I'm gonna hop on
the Long Thighland Expressway,

17
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,857
stop off for a nibble
in Breastport,

18
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:43,809
and then, with any luck,

19
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:47,245
I'll be pulling into
the Pork Authority by midnight.

20
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,615
Wait. You're <i>finally</i>
going to Bootytown?

21
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,366
Look, we just don't want
to rush anything, okay?

22
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:54,536
So we decided to wait
until she decides

23
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:56,238
to let me have sex
with her.

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,273
And that's
gonna be tonight!

25
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,958
How do you
know for sure?

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,994
Ah, something
she said earlier.

27
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,630
Guess what, my sweet boy,

28
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:07,949
I've got a special treat
for you tonight.

29
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:10,785
(electric guitar riff plays)

30
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:12,620
Oh, yeah, you're going
to Bootytown.

31
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:13,889
Hello again, my darlings.

32
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,475
Barney, I hope you're ready
for tonight.

33
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,126
Because you're gonna have
to use muscles

34
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:19,344
you haven't used in years.

35
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,762
I am?

36
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,397
Yes.

37
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,483
And I hope you have
some aspirin at home,

38
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,485
because your arse is gonna be
killing you tomorrow.

39
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,020
It is?

40
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:28,854
Indeed.

41
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:29,905
Because tonight...

42
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,974
I'm strapping on this.

43
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:34,409
We're going skating!

44
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,361
The Pork Authority's
closed.

45
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,979
Looks like it's Hand
Central Station

46
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,147
for you, little buddy.

47
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,315
(Marshall chuckles)

48
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,834
So that's your special treat?

49
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,202
Ice skating?

50
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,871
Of course.

51
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,823
And after that,
we're gonna shag.

52
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,208
We're going ice skating,
everybody!

55
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,460
Ask me what
I think of Nora.

56
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,929
What do you think of Nora?

57
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,096
Lovely girl.

58
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,015
Ask me what
I really think of her.

59
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:13,333
What do you really
think of her?

60
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:15,135
Guys, she's great, seriously.

61
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:16,770
Just drop it.

62
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:18,054
Ask me one more time.

63
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,556
What do you really think?

64
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,191
Fine! If you really must know,

65
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,276
I do not like Barney
with that woman!

66
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,195
Happy?

67
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,864
What could you possibly
not like about Nora?

68
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,950
Her hair?
Her mousy little nose?

69
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:32,202
The way she does
everything perfectly?

70
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:34,154
I mean, what's not to like?

71
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:37,908
It's not that I don't like her.
It's just...

72
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,376
She's our mom.

73
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,194
What do you mean,
she's your mom?

74
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:44,798
Everything about her
is vaguely our mom-like.

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,799
The British accent...

76
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,334
Hello again, my darlings.

77
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,219
<i>Mom's obsessed</i>
<i>with Julie Andrews,</i>

78
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:50,670
<i>so when we were growing up...</i>

79
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,423
(British accent):
Hello again, my darlings.

80
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,424
- Come here, you.
- Hey.

81
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:55,559
<i>And the way she hugs him.</i>

82
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,561
<i>Left hand on the nape</i>
<i>of the neck,</i>

83
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,763
<i>three gentle strokes on</i>
<i>the back with the right?</i>

84
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:01,314
Come here, you.

85
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>Trademark Loretta Stinson.</i>

86
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,901
<i>But here's the clincher...</i>

87
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:06,186
Guess what, my sweet boy.

88
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,071
Guess what
my sweet boy.

89
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:10,890
I've got a special treat
for you tonight.

90
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:14,411
I've got a special
treat for you tonight.

91
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:15,612
Ice cream!

92
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:18,448
(electric guitar riff plays)

93
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,116
They're coming.
Be cool.

94
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,901
Forgot my raincoat.

95
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:24,087
That makes one of us.

96
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,591
Well, shall we?

97
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:29,009
We shall.

98
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,350
Ooh, don't wear out
that tongue, Barney.

99
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,186
Don't wait up.

100
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,442
I mean, sure, Barney has slept

101
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:48,111
with plenty
of other people's mothers.

102
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,197
But now he's gonna sleep
with ours?

103
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,566
Psychologically speaking,
it's perfectly normal

104
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,752
to wind up with someone
like your parents.

105
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:59,105
Thanks to my mom, I'll probably
wind up with someone

106
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:01,174
who loves my brother
more than me.

107
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:02,442
Well, psychologically
speaking,

108
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:03,860
I'm gonna go
throw up now.

109
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,962
Oh...

110
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:07,780
Ugh! This baby
is making it

111
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,966
so I can't button
my pants anymore.

112
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:12,085
Big whoop.
In 55 years,

113
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,471
I don't think my dad
buttoned his pants even once.

114
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:16,089
And somehow, despite
sweet talk like that,

115
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,425
I don't feel sexy anymore.

116
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,959
Are you kidding?

117
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:22,479
I mean, you're-you're
even sexier now

118
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,314
that you're rounding out.
(gasps)

119
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:27,901
I mean, you're even
more sexy simply

120
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,653
because there's so
much more of you.

121
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,154
(gasps)

122
00:04:31,156 --> 00:04:32,906
I'm never gonna get
in the mood while

123
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,158
your mammoth Eriksen seed
is muffin-topping

124
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,694
the bodiddly out of me.

125
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:40,030
Are you saying,
"No erky-erky

126
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,665
until this baby
pops out"?

127
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:44,034
Okay, that's it.

128
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,619
I-I am making it my mission
to help you feel sexy again.

129
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,705
I don't care how much
more bloated you get.

130
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,290
I'll get the
next round!

131
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,208
Kevin!
Yay, Kevin, thank you!

132
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,659
So, Ted, you're cool

133
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,678
with Kevin, right?

134
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,596
I know he's been
over a lot lately.

135
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:59,665
Oh, yeah, yeah, Kevin's great.

136
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,603
I mean, there was, like,
one weird thing the other day...

137
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,592
He was just standing
there in his boxers?

138
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:10,593
Yeah.

139
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:12,195
I'll talk to him.

140
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:15,031
Ted...

141
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,284
be honest.

142
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:19,953
You'd bang Lily, right?

143
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,489
NARRATOR:
<i>So, later that night,</i>

144
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,457
<i>Barney and Nora went skating.</i>

145
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,826
Hey, kid, you know
how your mom won't

146
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,045
let you have ice cream
till after dinner?

147
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:32,332
But then the waiting
kind of makes it taste better?

148
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,384
Well, I've been waiting
two months

149
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,836
for that bowl
of ice cream.

150
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:40,206
And tonight,
I'm gonna have sex with it.

151
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,180
Look, Barney,
one foot!

152
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:48,714
Oh!

153
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,683
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, kids, for most guys,</i>

154
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,903
<i>this would have meant</i>
<i>the end of the date.</i>

155
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:57,574
<i>But your Uncle Barney</i>
<i>is not most guys.</i>

156
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:59,559
I can turn this around.

157
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,109
Well, I'm impressed
that you know

158
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,243
a 24-hour dentist.

159
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,661
Oh, yeah.

160
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,246
He can also give you tattoos,

161
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:13,331
do your taxes
and alter a suit.

162
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,667
But I wouldn't trust him
with a suit 'cause...

163
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,786
(glugging)

164
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:20,171
Speaking of drinking,
you want to...?

165
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,423
No, Barney.

166
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,907
Tonight's been
a disaster.

167
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,176
I think we should just
call it a night.

168
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,878
No! Come on, Nora,

169
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,432
your tooth can't be that bad.
Let me see.

170
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:36,104
W-Which is the fake one again?

171
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:37,755
(chuckles)

172
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:38,589
You look beautiful.

173
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,591
Mmm.

174
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:43,728
All right, maybe I could go
for one more drink.

175
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,263
Great.

176
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:47,449
(electric guitar riff plays)

177
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,817
It's funny.

178
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,620
Sometimes the most
romantic moments

179
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:53,371
can just creep up on you...

180
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,040
(gasping)

181
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:58,126
(whimpering)

182
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:00,111
(rat squeals)

183
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:01,579
(gasps)

184
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,133
I can turn this around.

185
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,751
Hey, um,

186
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,421
should've mentioned this before,
but, um, Ted and I prefer

187
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,122
that our guests remain
fully clothed in

188
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:13,458
the public areas
of the apartment.

189
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,792
Been some complaints.

190
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,761
Did Ted say something?

191
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,063
Oh, th-there's been
some complaints.

192
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,464
Not pointing any fingers
or anything,

193
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,933
but let's just keep
those pants on, okay? Good talk.

194
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:23,801
Well, if Ted said that,

195
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:27,305
I've got something to complain
about, too: Ted's nuts.

196
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:30,525
Okay, yes, Ted is a little
neurotic, but I wouldn't say...

197
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,862
No, no, no, I mean Ted's <i>nuts.</i>

198
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,865
Hi.

199
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:39,701
Hey.

200
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:41,786
(sighs)

201
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,427
(sighs)

202
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:53,682
So what? It's his apartment.

203
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,884
You're taking his side?

204
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,635
Wait, this isn't
one of those classic

205
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:59,337
"You still have feelings
for your ex-boyfriend,

206
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,939
"who's oddly also your roommate,

207
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,140
"which for the record
I'm totally cool with,

208
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:03,841
"even though everybody
tells me I've walked

209
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,443
into a bear trap" things, is it?

210
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,729
No, I just, I feel bad.

211
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,014
Ted's going through
some stuff right now.

212
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:13,401
You eyeballing his deal
is the most action

213
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:14,786
he's gotten in months.

214
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,072
I'll be nice to him.

215
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:20,408
So, I was trying
to think of how

216
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,378
to best express
how sexy you are to me.

217
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,996
A song? A poem?

218
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:27,832
And then it hit me:
a board game!

219
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,634
You just <i>get</i> women.

220
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:31,035
No, no, no, you'll like this.

221
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:34,556
We answer risqué questions
and perform spicy dares

222
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,258
to slowly move up
your shapely legs.

223
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,511
I call it Chutes and Lilies.

224
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:41,513
I would've guessed Monopo-Lily.

225
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:43,064
Yeah, that would've been better.

226
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,048
Okay, game play.

227
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,217
Roll the die to see
who goes first,

228
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:49,237
forfeit a turn on a pass--
intended for two-to-six players.

229
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,056
NARRATOR: As Marshall explained the many
<i>rules of Chutes and Lilies,</i>

230
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,909
<i>Lily thought back</i>
<i>to what Kevin said in the bar.</i>

231
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,829
It's perfectly normal to wind up
with someone like your parents.

232
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,448
<i>And then she thought of</i>
<i>the only other man she knew</i>

233
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,317
<i>who loved board games</i>
<i>that much.</i>

234
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:04,002
I brought Diseases!

235
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:05,286
Marshgammon.

236
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,871
Dog Fight Promoter!

237
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,623
Lilial Pursuit.

238
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,429
And that's how you play
the game.

239
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,547
Oh, wait.

240
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,465
I forgot to tell you
what happens

241
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,634
if I land on "community chest."

242
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:20,935
Honk-honk.

243
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,520
(laughs)

244
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:24,055
(groans)

245
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,423
I just want to go home,

246
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,592
take a long bath
and go to bed.

247
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:28,610
No!

248
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:30,928
I mean, come on.

249
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,615
My place is so much closer.

250
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,233
I'll-I'll draw you a bath,

251
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:38,769
pour you some champagne,
we can forget all about this.

252
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:42,073
All right,
that sounds good.

253
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,275
(electric guitar riff plays)

254
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,494
(sighs)

255
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:47,712
That bath was
wonderful.

256
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,080
- Thank you.
- Of course.

257
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,132
What do you say we go
out on the balcony,

258
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:52,167
get some fresh air?

259
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,135
Ooh, that sounds lovely.

260
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,223
What a beautiful view.

261
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:01,142
I couldn't agree more.

262
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,731
MAN:
Good-bye, cruel world!

263
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,099
Oh, my God!

264
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,235
I can turn this around.

265
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:11,152
Shh.

266
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,071
(thud)
Ooh!

267
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:15,990
Ooh! Date night.

268
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:19,360
You know what? I'll just,
just watch this in my room.

269
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:21,863
Already had dinner in there,
why not a movie?

270
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,948
You should join us.

271
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,217
Yeah, join us.

272
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:28,536
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Three's a crowd.

273
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,955
Besides, you guys wouldn't
want to watch this anyway.

274
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:32,040
Try us.

275
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,258
Well, have you seen <i>Die Hard?</i>

276
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,926
Um, yes.

277
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,327
Okay, the guy who played Argyle

278
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,797
produced this documentary
about coin collecting.

279
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:45,637
Now, I know my sexy
little lady can't resist

280
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,223
a bubble bath,
especially one

281
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,141
with rose petals.

282
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:52,777
Oh, thanks, baby.

283
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:53,778
(chuckles)

284
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,398
(shudders)

285
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,633
How about a sensual backrub?

286
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,869
(shudders)

287
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,019
Mm.

288
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,288
- Oh.
- What's the matter, Lilypad?

289
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,073
You love my backrubs.

290
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:08,409
Ah. I-I do... very much.

291
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,862
Good, because I got you
a brand-

292
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:13,581
new...

293
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,166
loofah!

294
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:17,335
(crying)

295
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,973
Oh, yeah!

296
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,475
Rubs... oh, yeah!

297
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:27,729
Trying to watch the coin
documentary over here.

298
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:31,382
Hey, Ted, ever figure out who
you're taking to that concert?

299
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:32,650
No.

300
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:34,235
- You want to go?
- (whispers): Sure.

301
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:35,703
- Really?
- Awesome!

302
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:36,938
It's a date!

303
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,407
NARRATOR: <i>Now, Kevin,</i>
<i>as a trained psychologist,</i>

304
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:42,043
<i>knew the appropriate way</i>
<i>to voice his displeasure.</i>

305
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:44,445
I think we need
to calmly discuss

306
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:47,115
the relationship dynamics
at play here.

307
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,617
I'm uncomfortable
with how close you two are

308
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:53,121
as roommates, given your
particular romantic history.

309
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:55,290
NARRATOR: <i>Instead, he took</i>
<i>a different approach.</i>

310
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,074
Aw, hell no!

311
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,093
If you can go on a date
with my girlfriend,

312
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,429
I don't have to wear pants
in your apartment!

313
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,265
I can't wait till
this baby comes out

314
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,351
so we can get started
on another one.

315
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:08,136
Then again,

316
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:09,470
why wait?
Ew, wait...

317
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:10,921
Get off of me!

318
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:11,889
Damn it!

319
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,191
Ever since Kevin said

320
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:15,326
it's normal to wind up
with your parents,

321
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:18,062
I... I keep picturing yo
as my dad.

322
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:21,265
Lily, that theory is crazy-town.

323
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:22,200
How do you know?

324
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:24,402
Because my mother is
six-foot-three,

325
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:26,454
she buys her clothes
at the drugstore,

326
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:29,123
and she prefers
to trap her own dinner.

327
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,743
I love you more than anything,

328
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,244
and you're nothing like her.

329
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,330
Aw.

330
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,799
Now, that's how
you turn a girl on.

331
00:12:37,801 --> 00:12:39,384
- Mm...
- Mm...

332
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:42,303
NARRATOR: <i>But then Marshall</i>
<i>really started thinking</i>

333
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:44,055
<i>about Kevin's theory.</i>

334
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:47,558
Midnight snack.

335
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,344
Midnight snack.

336
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:50,395
Mmm.

337
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:53,181
Oh, yeah.

338
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:57,402
Oh, yeah...!

339
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,938
I am gonna rock...

340
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,357
your...

341
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,575
world.

342
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,614
Yay.

343
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:11,582
If it's any consolation,

344
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:15,953
the, uh... the guy stole my
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> once.

345
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:20,675
So... guess the world's kind
of a better place without...

346
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:24,495
Oh, God, this
night's ruined.

347
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,264
Oh, come here, you.

348
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,720
Yes, it's been
a very tough night,

349
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:35,773
but I still think
we can turn this around.

350
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,392
Really?

351
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:38,643
Why not?

352
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:41,112
No sense in letting things
get us down.

353
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,948
How does that song
go again?

354
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:48,903
♪ Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens ♪

355
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:52,824
♪ Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens ♪

356
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:57,528
♪ Brown paper packages tied up

Mommy, no.

366
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:33,423
I want to thank you,
baby, for reminding me of

367
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:35,491
what a vivacious woman I am.

368
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:36,492
Yeah.

369
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:38,744
No, uh, no need really.

370
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:41,764
Whoa, but I've been
such a naughty girl.

371
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,517
Maybe I need a spanking.

372
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,219
Great. We'll...

373
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,156
we'll just skip
the board games

374
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:55,277
and get right down to me
making love to you.

375
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,446
Oh...

376
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,781
Okay, good, 'cause

377
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:04,286
I'm gonna ride you
like an unbroken stallion.

378
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:07,006
Okay.

379
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:09,675
Giddyup, cowgirl.

380
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,132
No, I can't go
through with this!

381
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,249
Thank God, me neither!

382
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,417
You're too much
like my dad.

383
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,885
You're too much
like <i>my</i> dad.

384
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:22,054
Your dad?!

385
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:25,090
Okay, dropping trou--
bad idea.

386
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,776
We're moving on from that.

387
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:28,444
This guy is a snake.

388
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,146
What?! No.

389
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:31,647
Ted? He's a nice guy.

390
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,449
A really, really nice guy.

391
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:35,701
You should be more like him.

392
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,420
Mom, right on schedule.

393
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:39,455
- What?
- Nothing.

394
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:40,956
I'm just saying,
you think he's so fragile,

395
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,875
and yet...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, fragile?

396
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:43,993
You think I'm fragile?

397
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:46,078
Yeah, fragile like a fox.

398
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,296
First, he tries

399
00:15:47,298 --> 00:15:49,448
scaring me off
with his little peep show.

400
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,883
Then he crashes our movie.

401
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:54,303
Now, he's got tickets to
some super romantic concert.

402
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:55,805
It's Weird Al Yankovic.

403
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:59,625
Okay. But still, who's the first
person he asked to go with him?

404
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,010
My girlfriend.

405
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:02,628
(laughs)
Oh, man. Okay.

406
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,130
You think I'm the first
person Ted asked?

407
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,265
(laughs)

408
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,901
Ted, am I the first person
you asked?

409
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,437
Marshall...!

410
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,938
You, me, Weird Al.

411
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,889
No thanks, Ted.

412
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:14,990
Barney...!

413
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:16,609
I got two tickets
to Weird Al Yan...

414
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:17,643
(phone beeps off)

415
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:18,694
Barney?

416
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,579
Lily...!

417
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,249
Come on! You'll be
the hottest girl there!

418
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:25,201
Okay, you'll be
the only girl there.

419
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:25,835
(phone beeps off)

420
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:27,703
Stuart...!

421
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:29,789
Claudia...!

422
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,006
Brad...!

423
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,175
Nat-alie...!

424
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,344
Trudy...!

425
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:37,296
Ranjit...!

426
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:39,832
Carl the bartender...!

427
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,518
Dude from my bodega...!

428
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,104
Steam cleaning coupon guy...!

429
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:47,206
Mom...!

430
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,858
Please? I'll fly you out.

431
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
I don't think so.

432
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,177
I'm sorry, sweet pea.

433
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,096
Is Clint there?

434
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,533
No.

435
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,903
Wow. You really
are pretty fragile.

436
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:05,357
Look, I'm trying to explain
to you guys that I'm...

437
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,877
Well, how do you
expect me to feel?!

438
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,161
I mean, all I want

439
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,997
is for someone to go
to a Weird Al concert with me,

440
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:14,500
and I'm stuck going
with my roommate.

441
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:17,136
Yeah, I might have to
rain-check you there, buddy.

442
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:18,871
I'm not a Weird Al fan.

443
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,223
He's just a rip-off
of Peculiar Jacques.

444
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,609
(accordion playing "O Canada")

445
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,844
(boing)

446
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:27,213
Guess I'm going to
this concert alone.

447
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,981
I'll be that weird guy.

448
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,734
I mean, that
other weird guy.

449
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:33,936
You know, there is one guy
you didn't ask yet.

450
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:36,655
Someone who happens to be
the biggest Weird Al fan

451
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,440
in the whole world.

452
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:41,360
Kevin...?

453
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:43,028
Ted...!

454
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,064
Oh! Oh, you are gonna flip
when you see our tickets.

455
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,616
They're in the shape
of an accordion.

456
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:48,951
(falsetto):
What?!

457
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:54,173
So, uh, you
like Weird Al?

458
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,708
Not in the slightest.

459
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,048
No, dude, I'm the biggest
Weird Al fan.

460
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,683
I know,
I'm agreeing with you.

461
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:08,137
Do you know that I gave him the
idea for "Like a Surgeon." Yeah.

462
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,723
Yeah. I wrote him a fan letter,
and then a few months later...

463
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:13,158
ALL: Bam!
Top of the charts!

464
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,110
You guys can eat it.

465
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:17,696
Just... eat it.

466
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:18,697
- Hey.
- Hey.

467
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,199
How'd it go with Nora?

468
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,483
Well, among other things,

469
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,786
I realized
Nora's a lot like my mom.

470
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,155
I'll bet that
ruined things, huh?

471
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:27,623
(electric guitar riff plays)

472
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,876
Come on. Barney Stinson
always turns it around.

473
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:32,444
- How?
- Simple.

474
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:36,682
I turned...
it... around.

475
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,284
OTHERS: Oh...
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

476
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,805
So the mom thing wasn't
a total deal breaker, huh?

477
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:43,873
No!

478
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,058
Guys, my mom is
the best person I know.

479
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,479
If Nora's even the tiniest bit
like her, I'm a lucky guy.

480
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,649
Hey, you know what?

481
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:56,485
I'm a real lucky guy.

482
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,687
'Cause I married my dad.

483
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,189
Aw.

484
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:04,326
So, uh, you want
to go get luckier?

485
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,030
Bye, guys.

486
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:09,665
See ya.

487
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,085
So, what should
we do now?

488
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,620
"We" should do nothing.

489
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,957
You guys get out of here,
go watch your movie.

490
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,375
I'm fine. Really.

491
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:21,043
- You sure?
- Yeah.

492
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,095
Thanks, buddy.

493
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:29,101
Uh, hey... hey, Kevin.

494
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,053
I think I'm a clone now.

495
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:33,138
(laughs)

496
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:36,325
I'm sorry.

497
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,943
Were you just quoting Weird Al?

498
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:39,778
I was indeed.

499
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,197
I'm a huge Weird Al fan.

500
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,034
Well, then I need
to buy you a drink.

501
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:47,286
I'll have a glass of champagne,
sweet pea.

502
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:49,622
One glass of champa--

503
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:50,906
Sweet pea?

504
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:55,127
Sure. Meeting
a fellow Weird Al fan?

505
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,296
That's cause
for celebration.

506
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:01,917
Bottle of bubbly,
coming right up!

507
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,535
