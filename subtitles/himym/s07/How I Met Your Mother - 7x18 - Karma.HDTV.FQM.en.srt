00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:03,880
<i>NARRATOR: Kids, 2012 started out
kind of crazy.</i>

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:06,478
Barney met a girl named Quinn,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,463
<i>Kevin unproposed to Robin,</i>

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:09,731
<i>I told Robin...</i>

5
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:11,099
I love you, Robin.

6
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:11,933
<i>When I asked if she</i>

7
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:13,852
<i>loved me back, she said...</i>

8
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:15,570
No.

9
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:16,721
<i>Marshall told Robin...</i>

10
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:18,690
You got to move out.

11
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:21,810
<i>And Robin did.</i>

12
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,803
I can't even open
her bedroom door anymore.

13
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:34,506
Why do I have
to be so sensitive?

14
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:36,791
I don't know, bro.

15
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,009
Look at me and that Quinn chick.

16
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,294
You don't hear me
prattling on

17
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,513
about how beautiful
her smile is,

18
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:45,550
how her hair is like a waterfall
of honey-colored silk,

19
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:48,970
how her eyes are like
a warm South Sea

20
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:52,256
kissed by the fire
and gold of sunrise.

21
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:54,258
I don't even remember
what she looks like.

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,260
Dude, you obviously like her.
Can't you read

23
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:57,445
between the lines, Ted?

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,780
I obviously like her.

25
00:00:58,782 --> 00:01:00,365
How did this happen to me?

26
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,601
When did I become such
a gooey romantic?

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,488
Look, I think it's healthy

28
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,240
that you have real feelings
for a woman

29
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:11,242
instead of just seeing her
as an object.

30
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:12,577
Switch?

31
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,294
Sure.

32
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:14,712
(snaps fingers)

33
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:15,747
But why Quinn?

34
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:17,281
I mean, you spent
one night with her,

35
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,449
and she was kind of mean.

36
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:19,834
We just connected.

37
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:22,787
Emotionally, intellectually,
spiritually.

38
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:23,755
So, mind-blowing sex?

39
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:26,558
Mind-blowing sex!

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,228
For an hour afterwards,
I couldn't uncross my eyes.

41
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,981
Which was awesome, because
when I went back for seconds,

42
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:35,316
it was like having
a three-way with twins.

43
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:37,402
So... call her.

44
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:39,637
I would if I knew how
to get in touch with her,

45
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,573
but I can't,
and it's driving me crazy.

46
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:42,774
Everywhere I look,
I see her.

47
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,192
I see her walking on the street;

48
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:46,811
I see her shopping in the store;

49
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:48,830
I see her dancing on that pole.

50
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:50,915
I see her dancing
on that pole, too.

51
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,251
Oh, my God, that's Quinn.

00:01:53,253 --> 00:01:56,437

I really appreciate
you guys taking me in.

56
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,104
I mean,

57
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:14,606
I'm homeless,

58
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:16,858
things between me and Ted
are still kind of weird.

59
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,143
So, it's nice
to be around friends.

60
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:20,979
Well, stay as long
as you want, sweetie.

61
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:22,179
Oh, thank you.

62
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,531
Mm.

63
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,700
Now, I got you a journal.

64
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:26,951
I know this sounds lame,

65
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:29,621
but it really helps work
through stuff to write about it.

66
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:30,955
Oh.

that one's mine.

71
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:41,631
You are going to have
so much fun here.

72
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:44,469
Oh, guys, please, do not feel like you
have to keep me entertained.

73
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:46,704
Well, you shouldn't have come
to East Meadow, Long Island,

74
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:48,506
Robin, if you didn't want
to be entertained.

75
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:50,808
Really? I didn't think
there was a ton to do here.

76
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,144
Oh, apparently, someone
hasn't heard

77
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,263
of the Uniondale
Miniatures Museum.

78
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:57,482
You'll come for
the 19th century thimble art,

79
00:02:57,484 --> 00:03:01,069
but you'll stay for the
Dutch masters on bottle caps.

80
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:01,936
Plus,

81
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,104
you'll be bowling
with two

82
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:06,441
charter members of the
East Meadow Alley Cats.

83
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:08,159
"We're a hot dog eating team

84
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,861
with a bowling problem."

85
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:10,862
Shirley

86
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:12,396
came up with that one.

87
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,448
Great bowler, Shirley.

88
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,450
She hit 280 the other day.

89
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:19,053
Unfortunately,
that was on her bathroom scale.

<i>NARRATOR: When Robin moved out,</i>

91
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:22,907
<i>there was a hole in my life</i>

92
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,792
<i>in the shape
of an empty bedroom.</i>

93
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:27,411
<i>I filled it with a new hobby.</i>

94
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:29,213
(sizzling)

95
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:30,581
(coughing)

96
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,300
What are you doing
in my old room?

97
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:34,135
This room being empty
was bumming me out,

98
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:35,853
so I decided
to do something healthy

99
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:37,305
that would take my mind off you.

100
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:38,756
Well, nothing says healthy

101
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,892
like smoking 40 pounds
of pork loin

102
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:42,226
in an unventilated room

103
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,729
while having an imaginary
conversation with your ex.

104
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:47,031
Just for that,
you're not getting any.

105
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,232
I'm not getting any?

106
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,101
You're the one smoking
your own meat.

107
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:51,152
Oh!

108
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:52,987
(knocking)

109
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,707
What am I gonna do
about this Quinn thing?

110
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,108
I want to ask her out again,

111
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,210
but I don't know how I feel
about her being a stripper.

112
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:01,829
Why would you have
an issue with that?

113
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:04,465
I mean, you've dated convicted
felons, arms dealers...

114
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,050
pageant moms.

115
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:10,004
Hey, Quinn is someone I might
want to get serious with,

116
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:11,495
not just pretend to be a judge

117
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,476
who can help her four year old clinch "little miss biloxi"

118
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:17,729
<i>(chuckles) Tiffany's mom really
wanted that tiara.</i>

119
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,798
In a city of eight
million people,

120
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,901
you happened to walk into
the club where she works?

121
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:24,936
Maybe it's destiny.

122
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:27,322
No, Destiny strips
at The Melon Patch.

123
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,924
They're people, Ted;
try to keep them straight.

124
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,593
Wait a minute.

125
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:35,780
What if this is destiny?

126
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:36,664
I just said...

127
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,282
What if the universe

128
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:41,336
is throwing us in each other's
path for some reason?

129
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:42,537
More or less exactly what I...

130
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,322
I don't care what you say,
this is destiny!

131
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:46,374
Damn it, Ted!

132
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:48,626
Why can't you ever root
for love?

133
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:55,499
Hey.

134
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:57,135
Hey.

135
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:58,269
Quinn...

136
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,437
No, listen,

137
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,406
in here I'm Karma, okay?

138
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:02,506
Got it.

139
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:03,808
Uh, look, Karma,

140
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,809
I swear

141
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,994
I never say crap
like this, but...

142
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:08,196
I think maybe
the universe

143
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:10,581
is telling us something.

144
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,183
You want to go out again?

145
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:14,569
I'm sorry,
I don't date customers.

146
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:15,870
What about destiny?

147
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,789
I heard she's
over at The Melon Patch now.

148
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,492
No, I mean like fate telling us
that we're supposed to be...

149
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:22,660
Oh, listen, Barney,

150
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:24,912
my manager is really
giving me the stink eye.

151
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:26,798
I have to get back to work.

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,832
Okay, wait, wait.

153
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,550
What if I pay for a dance?

154
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:30,501
That way,

155
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:31,586
your manager's happy,

156
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:32,920
and then I can to tell you

157
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,705
why you should go on
another date with me.

158
00:05:34,707 --> 00:05:37,475
I guess there's
no reason why not.

159
00:05:37,477 --> 00:05:40,211
Okay, first off,
we have a lot in common.

160
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,596
For example,

161
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,714
both of our jobs
are largely financed

162
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:46,901
by drunk Asian businessmen.

163
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,770
<i>Dear Diary.</i>

164
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,772

<i>how each hour here feels

168
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,697
<i>So far, they have welcomed me</i>

169
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,734
<i>and given me a rare glimpse
into their bizarre way of life.</i>

170
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:06,904
<i>By "entertainment," they mean
table shuffle board,</i>

171

<i>macramé classes, and other
non-stimulating activities</i>

172

00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,115
<i>In their lairs, they often don
a primitive shroud</i>

180
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:37,819
<i>called a "Snugget,"
and it is not uncommon for them</i>

181
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,937
<i>to go to sleep before 9 p.m.,</i>

182
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,772
<i>fearing, as they do,</i>

183
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:43,407
<i>the night.</i>

184
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,527
<i>Also Diary, I think writing
in you is stupid,</i>

185
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:47,795
but you were a gift from Lily,

186
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,330
<i>and she's watching
me right now.</i>

187
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:52,884
Guys, um, I don't want
to overstay my welcome,

188
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:55,619
and Patrice said that she would
take me off your hands.

189
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:58,639
So, do you have
a train schedule or...

190
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,891
Oh, yeah,

191
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:00,892
um, but-but

192
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:03,728
there's a-a problem
with the train.

193
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,429
Big, big problem.

194
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:06,330
There was a...

195
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,599
Strike.
A lightning strike.

196
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,802
That hit one of the picketers
who was on strike.

197
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,938
During a thunderstorm.

198
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,942
Plus,

199
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:21,078
Yeah, she probably doesn't
even want you there.

200
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,501
You guys are being weird.

201
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:29,670
Oh!
Oh!

202
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:32,323
Oh, my God, Robin,
I am so sorry.

203
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:33,925
I'll throw these in the wash.

204
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:36,844
They'll be dry
and folded in the morning.

205
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,329
Or the weekend.

206
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,997
And we can talk
about you leaving then.

207
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,349
(quietly):
Or never.

208
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:43,851
Wait, Lily, why don't...
(yawns loudly)

209
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:45,853
It's 8:45,
time to hit the hay.

210
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,939
LILY:
Good night!

211
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:49,506
(lock clicks)

212
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:55,646
So Ted, what healthy,

213
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:58,182
not-at-all-crazy activity
are you up to now?

214
00:07:58,184 --> 00:08:01,852
I liked smoking meat,
but now I've got a new passion:

215
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,454
wood.

216
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:06,490
You hear these things that come
out of your mouth, right?

217
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:08,025
(knocking)

218
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,198
So I went back to
the Lusty Leopard.

219
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,716
You know what, Barney?

220
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:18,753
I know I said I have a rule
about not dating customers,

221
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:22,657
but you may have
convinced me to...

222
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,208
(music stops)
Oh.

223
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,643
Song's over, I got to go.

224
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:27,878
Wait, no, what?
Convinced you to what?

225
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,848
I'm sorry, but manager's
giving me the stink eye.

226
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,150
Ugh, get a life, Manager.

227
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,719
What were you saying?

228
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,139
Well, I was going to say

229
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,826
that I do find you
very... charming.

230
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:42,559
(chuckles)

231
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,362
And funny...

232
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:45,813
and sexy.

233
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:48,666
And exciting and smart.

234
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:51,002
You so get me.

235
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:52,703
You know what, Barney?

236
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:55,206
I have never done
this before,

237
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,909
but there's just
something about you.

238
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,595
So I guess my answer is...

239
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:02,129
(music stops)
(gasps) Oh.

240
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,130
The song's over.

241
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:04,849
Well, just finish the thought!

242
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,384
But the manager.
God,

243
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,385
I hate manager.

244
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,320
(snoring)

245
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:11,689
There. Your answer is...

246
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:14,108
Maybe if we knew each other
a little better.

247
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,092
(sighs)

248
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,110
Tell me about yourself.

249
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:18,112
Well, um, what can I tell you?

250
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:19,113
I'm, um...

251
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:21,282
charming and funny

252
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:23,901
and sexy and...

253
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:27,455
exciting and smart.

254
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:29,457
Well, how can a girl
say no to that?

255
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,826
How about we...

256
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:33,794
go out on...

257
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:37,581
aaaaaaaaa...

258
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,417
aaaaaa...

259
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,135
Ugh, these songs are so short.

260
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:43,170
(groans)

261
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:47,591
Uh, how much exactly
did you give Quinn?

262
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:49,060
Eight, nine hundred bucks,

263
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:51,896
plus whatever
my Rolex is worth.

264
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,064
Whoa.

265
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,098
I know.

266
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,134
Ted, I think I'm in love.

267
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:06,404
Quinn is totally playing you.

268
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,371
What?

269
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,856
That's ridiculous.

270
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,091
If she were playing me,

271
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:12,076
why would she agree
to go on a date with me?

272
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,495
You're different than
the rest of these schlubs.

273
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:17,998
This one time only,
I'm going to break my rule.

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,864
Let's go out tomorrow night.

275
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,089
Sweet!

276
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:24,509
Oh, shoot!
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

277
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:27,027
Hey! Brainstorm!

278
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,797
What if we just have
our date here,

279
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:30,861
It's a date.

280
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:35,163
It's not a date, if you go into a
strip club and paying for lap dances.

281
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:38,072
If it's not a date, why'd she
say, every fifth day was free?

282
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,887
Because that's
the Lusty Leopard's policy

283
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,556
on Friday nights, and I'm so mad
at you that I know that!

284
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,243
<i>ROBIN: Dear Diary.</i>

285
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,162
<i>It is day six on this island,</i>

286
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:51,882
<i>and I begin to fear I am
more captive than guest...</i>

287
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:53,784
(screams)

288
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,169
Morning, sweetie.

289
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,171
Up for croquet?

290
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:00,574
Hey, uh, Lil, are you done

291
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,710
washing my clothes yet?
Because I...

292
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:03,928
Oh, I am so sorry.

293
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,013
Your clothes accidentally
wound up in the bag

294
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,065
I donated to Goodwill.

295
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,250
You gave away my clothes?

296
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,220
They were a bit fancy
for East Meadow.

297
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:15,389
(whispers):
People were staring.

298
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:18,976
Besides, we have
an extra Snugget.

299
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,645
Try it.

300
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,815
Try it, Robin.

301
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:28,736
<i>ROBIN: They're trying to make me
one of them, Diary.</i>

302
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:31,655
<i>And I begin to fear...</i>

303
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,041
<i>I may like it!</i>

304
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,629
I can't believe we're
at a strip club,

305
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,931
and the biggest boob
in here is you.

306
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,300
It's a real date, Ted.

307
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,303
And clearly you haven't
seen the DeSalvo twins.

308
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,555
She's right over there.

309
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,640
Barney...
Yowza!

310
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,292
You are not on a date.

311
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,611
Okay, look, prove it.

312
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,180
Prove that she's not just
taking advantage of you.

313
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,599
Get her to go out with
you anywhere but here.

314
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,850
Fine!

315
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,319
Hey, sexy! You want a dance?

316
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,654
Yeah!

317
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,156
Uh, one thing, though.

318
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,491
Um, you'd be okay
with us having a date

319
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,309
somewhere besides here,
wouldn't you?

320
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,862
I was hoping you would ask that.

321
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,582
I'm sorry it's
so expensive in here,

322
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:16,700
but it's nice and private, huh?

323
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,169
Absolutely. And romantic!

324
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,287
It's our first getaway
as a couple!

325
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:22,990
It's become clear to me, Diary,

326
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,875
<i>that I must attempt
a dramatic escape.</i>

327
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,095
<i>I will fake a stomach ache
during dinner.</i>

328
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,297
<i>Then, after Marshall and Lily
leave for bingo night,</i>

329
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,433
<i>I will sneak out the back.</i>

330
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,302
<i>I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal
and drive to the train station.</i>

331
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,337
<i>Shirley's 42, by the way,
and rides a Rascal.</i>

332
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,192
<i>I swear, it's the second half
of Wall-E out here.</i>

333
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,343
(two handclaps)

334
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,029
Bingo...

335
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,866
was canceled.

336
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,506
Hey, sexy, you want a dance?

337
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,875
(chuckles) No,
I'm not a customer.

338
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,359
My girlfriend works here.

339
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,162
She's right over...

340
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,632
This one time only,
I'm gonna break my rule.

341
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,083
Let's go out tomorrow night!

342
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,034
Sweet!

343
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,319
Oh, shoot!

344
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,438
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

345
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,673
Hey! Brainstorm!

346
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,592
What if we just have
our date here,

347
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,045
maybe in
the Champagne Room?

348
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:22,750
That was our spot.

349
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,427
Hey, gorgeous,
You want a dance?

350
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:31,863
Is it a jig?

351
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:33,965
'Cause if so, it's up.

352
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,200
Sorry, I only had the last verse

353
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,703
of "Hot For Teacher" to work
on that. What was that?

354
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:42,606
You laid exactly the same line
on that guy that you did on me!

355
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:43,624
Sweetie, that is just something

356
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:46,294
I say to these
gullible losers here.

357
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:47,912
They fall for it every time.

358
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:51,716
(chuckling): Bunch of losers!

359
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:53,718
Oh, gosh, manager again.

360
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,919
He's looking at me like,

361
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,671
"Karma, why aren't you booking
more time

362
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:57,838
in the Champagne Room?"

363
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,174
Well, we'll show him.

364
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:02,793
No! You're playing me again!

365
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,346
And you're not even trying hard!

366
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:07,148
There's no manager there;
You're pointing at a fern!

367
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:10,601
Ted was right.

368
00:14:10,603 --> 00:14:13,454
I bet he's home right now,
laughing at how dumb I am.

369
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,612
Did I deserve this?
Absolutely.

370
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:24,615
I have told
some outrageous lies.

371
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,968
I have told women I was famous,

372
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,336
a war hero,

373
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,821
that sex with me would cure
their nearsightedness.

374
00:14:30,823 --> 00:14:32,456
Barney?!

375
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:37,762
I probably deserved everything
you did to me and more.

376
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:39,430
But I have been trying,

377
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:42,416
and trying hard
to be a better person.

378
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:44,185
Thanks for showing me

379
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,736
I had it right before.

380
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:57,064
Look, I'm sorry we made you feel
a little suffocated,

381
00:14:57,066 --> 00:15:00,451
but were you really
just gonna sneak away?

382
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:03,371
Well, it's just...
I really miss the city.

383
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,706
I know you guys love it here,
and that's fine,

384
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,024
We don't love it here!

385
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:07,691
What?

386
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:08,859
Come on, Robin,

387
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:10,878
what kind
of life is this?

388
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,463
Going to canasta tournaments

389
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,165
and high school
field hockey playoffs?

390
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,751
Oh, I think North Bellmore
can take state.

391
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,753
With Sophie's ankle?
Doubtful.

392
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,888
Okay, but if you two
are so unhappy,

393
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,890
why don't you just move
back to Manhattan?

394
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,593
Because the suburbs are
better for the baby.

395
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:28,729
Who says? Who says any place
is better for the baby

396
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:30,931
if you two are unhappy in it?

397
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:35,386
No, no,
we live here now.

398
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:37,772
And, you know,
this place

399
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:39,240
wouldn't seem
so bad if...

400
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:42,126
we got one of our friends
to move out here.

401
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,561
Oh, guys...

402
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:47,531
Oh...

403
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,267
I would rather set myself
on fire.

404
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:54,571
<i>NARRATOR: The next morning,
Barney learned that even in</i>

405
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:57,875
<i>a city of eight million people,
there's no escaping Karma.</i>

406
00:15:57,877 --> 00:16:00,428
(light music playing)

407
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:05,082
(sighs)

408
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,100
Oh.

409
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:07,768
Oh, hey.

410
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,554
Sorry, can't talk;
manager's watching.

411
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:13,524
Look, I am sorry

412
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:15,443
if I hurt your feelings;
it's a job.

413
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:16,811
Yeah, well, at my job,

414
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,729
we don't rip out
people's hearts for money.

415
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:23,317
My company briefly backed
a lab in North Korea

416
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,403
which did, but we sold it!

417
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:27,321
You know, I've worked
at that club for a year.

418
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:28,706
You practically live there,

419
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,658
and you didn't even recognize me
the night we went out.

420
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,777
You can't pretend to be some
hurt little victim with me.

421
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,829
I know you.

422
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,047
Well, of course you do.

423
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:37,614
I told you things
I don't tell anybody.

424
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:38,799
I was honest with you.

425
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,918
Yeah, because I believe you have
a gay black brother,

426
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,636
a friend lonely enough
to smoke his own meat

427
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:44,472
and that your mom was a groupie
for Supertramp.

428
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:47,508
They named
their band for her!

429
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:51,628
You remembered all that?

430
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,014
Well, yeah.
I mean,

431
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:55,299
you're more interesting
than the lyrics

432
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:57,935
to "Pour Some Sugar On Me"
for the 8,000th time.

433
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:01,522
You know, it's funny.

434
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:04,692
Almost every woman
I've ever met was wrong

435
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:06,310
to give me a chance.

436
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:09,463
You're the first woman
who's wrong not to.

437
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:14,118
Large black coffee...

438
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,154
and whatever he's having.

439
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,756
It's on me.

440
00:17:19,657 --> 00:17:22,009
The same.

441
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,427
Thank you.

442
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,846
You're welcome.

443
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:28,849
1,700 more of these
and we're even.

444
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:30,834
Uh, the song just ended.

445
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,669
That mean you got
to get going?

446
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,972
No.

447
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:37,024
Do you have time
to sit with me?

448
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:39,794
I don't know.
You're wearing my watch.

449
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,733
Pottery.
Now you're making pottery.

450
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:47,618
I needed a new vase...

451
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,520
and some plates.

452
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:50,788
And bowls.

453
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,207
The china cabinet I built had
some design flaws.

454
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,960
Why don't you just turn
this into a guest room?

455
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:57,328
A guest room?

456
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,363
(chuckles) You mean
a room ready and waiting

457
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:00,697
for someone who isn't there?

458
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:03,918
A room devoted to reminding me
that I'm still alone?

459
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,338
Yeah, I don't need that.

460
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,176
Ted, no matter how many things
you put in this room...

461
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,445
I'll still be here.

462
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,698
(knocking)

463
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:26,723
Hey.

464
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:28,909
Hey!

465
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,778
Come on in.

466
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,746
Thanks.

467
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,283
Oh, um, thanks for packing up
the rest of my stuff.

468
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:38,619
No problem. Uh, you
want some coffee?

469
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:40,955
Uh, sure. Yeah?
Yeah.

470
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,407
So, how are things?

471
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:45,376
Good! You?
Great!

472
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,361
You know, I actually
made this mug.

473
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:48,929
Oh, yeah? Oh!
Yeah. Oh!

474
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,599
Yeah, sorry, coffee's
a little strong.

475
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:55,269
How was your stay
with Marshall and Lily?

476
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,304
Uh... a little weird.

477
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:59,440
They're not loving Long Island.

478
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:00,608
Oh.

479
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,142
I think deep down, they realize

480
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,111
it just... isn't a good fit.

481
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:07,698
It's hard to admit that
sometimes.

482
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,567
Sure is.

483
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:12,870
But I guess it's better
to face it and move on

484
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:17,575
than try to force something that
just isn't meant to be, right?

485
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,293
I think so.

486
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:20,644
Yeah.

487
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:22,546
So, what do you think

488
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,098
you're gonna do
with my old room?

489
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,616
Haven't really thought about it.

490
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,284
Oh!

491
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,509
Who needs Manhattan?

492
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:36,844
Yeah.

493
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:38,962
(phone buzzes)

494
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:40,964
Hmm, it's Ted.
He wants to know

495
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:42,983
if we want to hang
out in the city.

496
00:19:42,985 --> 00:19:44,852
The next train leaves
in nine minutes.

497
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,984
(door closes)

498
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:05,956
<i>TED: Dear Lily and Marshall,
I don't know if you know this,</i>

499
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,959
<i>but I never took
your names off the lease.</i>

500
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:12,663
<i>Well, today
I took my name off it.</i>

501
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:15,666
<i>The apartment is now yours.</i>

502
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:18,502
<i>And I think I finally figured
out the best thing</i>

503
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,471
<i>to do with Robin's old room.</i>

504
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:22,606
(soft gasp)

505
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:32,983
<i>See, for me, this place has
begun to feel a little haunted.</i>

506
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:35,569
<i>At first, I thought
it was haunted by Robin,</i>

507
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:38,439
<i>but now I think
it was haunted by me.</i>

508
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:43,494
<i>Well, no ghost is at peace
until it finally moves on.</i>

509
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:46,714
<i>I need a change.</i>

510
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,749
<i>And I think you do, too.</i>

511
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:51,418
<i>This apartment needs
some new life.</i>

512
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,756
<i>So, please, make our old home
your new home.</i>

513
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:58,275
<i>It is now ghost-free.</i>

514
00:20:58,277 --> 00:20:59,893
<i>Love, Ted.</i>
