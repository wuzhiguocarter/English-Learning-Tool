1
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:03,796
Hey, guys.
Where are Marshall and Lily?

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:05,714
Something terrible
happened.

3
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:07,516
Are they okay?
Are they in the hospital?

4
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:08,784
No.

5
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:12,821
Somewhere much... much worse.

6
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:14,056
Long Island!

7
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:15,557
Tonight, we're moving
out there for good.

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,111
Yeah. Here are your spare
keys to our new house.

9
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:20,512
Long Island?

10
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:21,897
I don't understand.

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,099
You can get spray tans here.

12
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,184
I never let myself

13
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:27,319
believe this day
would really come.

14
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:28,570
It's like when
they canceled

15
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:30,856
<i>Party of Five</i>
for the second time.

16
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,844
I mean when they...
canceled sports.

17
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:38,647
Guys, we'll still see
each other all the time,

18
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:40,148
and we'll talk
on the phone.

19
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,201
And I know people say
that having kids means

20
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,702
you won't see your
friends anymore, but...

21
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:45,254
Oh, God, this is
good-bye, isn't it?

22
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:46,622
No. Stop it.

23
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:47,873
Guys, this doesn't

24
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,124
change anything.

25
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:52,378
We are only a 46-minute
train ride away.

26
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,512
Just pop out

27
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,847
whenever you want.

28
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:57,716
So... I guess
this seat is open.

29
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,937
I'll go get a chair.

30
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:05,391
So that's it.

31
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:06,842
No more Marshall.

32
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:07,893
No more Lily.

33
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,511
They're gone.

34
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:11,513
Which means...

35
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,182
no lame married couple

36
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:16,902
shooting down
all my amazing ideas.

37
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,987
Guys, great news.

38
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,964
I'm the new leader
of the gang!

42
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:39,925
I like it there much better.
Yeah.

43
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,042
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

44
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:42,594
Wrong!

45
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:45,046
This can't go here.

46
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,149
<i>Kids, when he found out</i>
<i>she was pregnant,</i>

47
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,717
<i>Lily's estranged father</i>

48

50

<i>But after two weeks,</i>
<i>they'd had just about enough.</i>

51
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:56,942
That has to go there

52
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,827
to cover up
the splintery floorboard.

53
00:01:58,829 --> 00:01:59,778
And you can't hang

54
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,196
this picture here.

55
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:03,665
This isn't plaster;
it's dried toothpaste.

56
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,436
Guys, you're so lucky I'm here.

57
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,121
I grew up in this house.

58
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:11,573
I know it like
the back of my hand.

59
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:14,293
And this lamp
absolutely cannot be here.

60
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,044
Why not?

61
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:18,180
Blocks my view
of the Widow Rodriguez

62
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:20,349
doing her Jane Fonda workouts.

63
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,267
Isn't she
a little old, Dad?

64
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,254
Oh, you didn't see her
when I was a kid.

65
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:28,457
In my mind, she'll always be 54.

66
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:34,279
I know he means well, but
I can't take it anymore.

67
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,097
He won't leave,
and-and he's acting

68
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,933
like this is his house.
No, I know.

69
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:40,452
And these annoying notes
he keeps leaving around?

70
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:43,155
"I need absolute silence
when practicing the drums."

71
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:46,107
"Do not touch the fudge
in my nightstand."

72
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:48,794
"We need ant traps
for my nightstand."

73
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,446
I find myself
hiding out here

74
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:53,415
just because it's the only room
in the house

75
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,583
where he can't boss us around.

76
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:55,801
Great news.

77
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:58,286
I put new batteries
in the old intercom system.

78
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,472
Now we can communicate
at all times.

79
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,641
Mickey out.

80
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,011
Look at what's become
of our booth.

81
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:08,347
Looks like my old
shop teacher's hand--

82
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,999
just sort of
missing something.

83
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,734
Enough!

84
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,153
I am sick of you two
wallowing in sadness,

85
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,772
instead of doing
the healthy thing

86
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:18,574
and pretending
anyone who leaves you

87
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,026
never existed
in the first place.

88
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,494
I hate to agree with Barney's

89
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,645
near-paralyzing
abandonment issues,

90
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,030
but he has a point.

91
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,198
You can't just stop living

92
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,983
because two of your friends
moved away.

93
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:29,368
Precisely.

94
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,205
Now, as new group leader,
I say we go out and do something

95
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,624
that we never would have done
with Marshall and Lily here.

96
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:37,042
Ooh.

97
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:41,880
Remember that amazing idea
I had that one time?

98
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:44,666
Let's go to a strip club.
Nope.

99
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,635
So what do you say?

100
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:49,337
Let's declare
our independence

101
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:52,941
with an on-da-peen dance.

102
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,395
On-the-peen dance.

103
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,896
No, we got it.
We got it.

104
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,180
Let's go to a strip club!

105
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:00,232
Well...

106
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,516
I'm going to miss
them anywhere.

107
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,652
Might as well see some
cans while I'm at it.

108
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:04,853
I'll take it!

109
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:06,622
Robin, Kevin, you in?

110
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,491
<i>Kids, early in any</i>
<i>relationship,</i>

111
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:12,194
<i>there's a phase where you don't</i>
<i>say no to anything.</i>

112
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:14,930
<i>Because you want</i>
<i>to seem interesting...</i>

113
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:17,299
<i>adventurous...</i>

114
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:19,051
<i>and open-minded.</i>

115
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:21,169
<i>I call it</i>
<i>Early Relationship Chicken.</i>

116
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,388
Well, I'm open
to anything.

117
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,841
Oh, mos' def.

118
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:27,709
So...
So...

119
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,062
<i>I don't want to go</i>
<i>to a strip club.</i>

120
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,597
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to go to a strip club.</i>

121
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,815
<i>But I don't want him</i>
<i>to think I'm some prude.</i>

122
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:36,935
<i>Man, we've been saying "so"</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

123
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:38,937
Yeah!
Yeah!

124
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:41,440
Yes!

125
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:44,159
Tonight is going
to be legen--

126
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,445
Wait, are we sure it's a
good idea to go to a strip club?

127
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:50,332
Shut up, Lily!
I'm in charge now-- dary!

128
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,669
I've got no
cell reception.

129
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:55,287
I wanted to call Ted.

130
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,371
This feels weird.

131
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:58,073
The last time I lived
this far from him

132
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,124
was my semester abroad.

133
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,126
You never did a semester abroad.

134
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,577
That's what I called it
when we lived

135
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,446
on opposite sides of campus.

136
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,465
Wrong!

137
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,317
Please tell me you're not
plugging that in there.

138
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,303
Yes, Mickey,
that's exactly what I'm doing.

139
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,921
All right, fine.
I won't say anything.

140
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:15,440
It's... just that
this was my room

141
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,758
when I growing up,

142
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,977
so I know it a little
better than you.

143
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,763
Lot of great memories here.

144
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,483
Mostly just discovering my body.

145
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,702
That's it.

146
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:28,036
Mickey, since you got here,

147
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:30,322
you've been nothing
but judgmental and pushy

148
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:33,075
and strangely obsessed
with your adolescent sex life.

149
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:34,326
Tomorrow morning,

150
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:36,111
you're out of here.

151
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:38,279
Well, I-I've just been trying
to help you...

152
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,715
We don't need your help!

153
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,286
I...

154
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:46,972
Oh, it-it's okay, baby.

155
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,807
It had to be done.

156
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,765
Too bad the one person

157
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,633
who could stop you
from making mistakes like that

158
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,502
was told he has to move out
next month.

159
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,338
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!

160
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,474
Would either of you
like a dance?

161
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,612
I'm always ready to rock.

162
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:13,448
And I'm always ready to roll.

163
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,784
So...
So...

164
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:18,003
<i>I'm not ready to rock.</i>

165
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:20,172
<i>Rolling makes me dizzy.</i>

166
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,792
Hell, yeah!
Yeah!

167
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:26,845
I'm buying my man a lap dance,
'cause that's just how I do!

168
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,496
Party like a
rock star!

169
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:30,615
Party like a rock star...

170
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:32,217
Uh, hey, guys.

171
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,468
It's Ted.

172
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,170
Um... you're probably busy
with the move still.

173
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,438
Um...

174
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,391
Give me a call
if you want to gab.

175
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:41,727
Sorry about using
the word "gab."

176
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,062
Ted, stop pining
over Marshall and Lily.

177
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,981
Have some self-respect.

178
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,516
Now, put this fiver
in your mouth so...

179
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:50,518
that stripper with the lazy eye
can vacuum it up with...

180
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,737
Barney!
Wh-what?

181
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,121
I'm allowed to miss them, okay?

182
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,456
They're my two best friends.

183
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,957
I'm your two best friends!

184
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:58,126
And we're here tonight

185
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:00,695
to show you there's no need
to miss something

186
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:03,298
when you can replace it
with something better.

187
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,134
Gentlemen, say hello
to J-J-J-Jasmine!

188
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,347
Remember her?

189
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:22,350
<i>- So, a while back, we discovered</i>-

190
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:23,851
<i>Lily had a doppelganger</i>

191
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:27,388
<i>who was a Russian stripper.</i>

192
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,923
Look at her, Ted.

193
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,608
She's just like old,

194
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,692
less-good Lily,

195
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:33,027
but instead of
bossing us around,

196
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,278
she shows us her boobs.

197
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,846
No touching.

198
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:38,149
Okay, a little
bossing us around.

199
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,151
I call her Better Lily.

200
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:43,538
Hey, Better Lily, please
dance for my friend.

201
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,873
Barney, I don't
need a lap dance.

202
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,326
I need to talk
to my friends.

203
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:50,694
Who says you
can't do both?

204
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,380
Talk to her.
She's got ears.

205
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:54,531
Yes, she does have ears.

206
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,584
You want to touch my
girlfriend's boobs?

207
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,052
50 bucks.

208
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:01,722
Wait-- Better Lily
is dating this behemoth?

209
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:03,841
Sound like anyone
you know?

210
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,542
That's New Marshall.

211
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,946
This is our gang now.

212
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,560
Hey, guys, Ted again.

213
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,896
Starting to think
you forgot about me.

214
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,999
Or replaced me
with some cool neighbor.

215
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,450
What's his name?!

216
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,235
I'm totally kidding.

217
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,787
Anyway, uh...

218
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,755
just trying to remember
what your faces look like.

219
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:36,674
Ted, when they serve alcohol
at a strip club,

220
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,376
you're not allowed
to show your vagina.

221
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:41,596
100 bucks, and you
will see the world, my friend.

222
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:43,881
They're already
ignoring my calls?

223
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,433
Look, I'm realistic.

224
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:48,185
I knew I'd have to get used
to going to the dentist alone,

225
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:50,054
but I didn't think
they'd cut me out completely.

226
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,055
If they don't

227
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,140
need us, we don't need them.

228
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:54,942
Yes! Finally!

229
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:57,812
By the way, did you see
how she opened that bottle?

230
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,666
Whoa.

231
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:04,585
Lights out in the suburbs
is... is really dark.

232
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,936
Where's the fuse box?

233
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,238
I don't know.

234
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,074
I know where it is.

235
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:13,744
Maybe I could fix it for you,
if I wasn't so busy packing.

236
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,112
You know what?

237
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:17,114
I bet the fuse box
is in the basement.

238
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:18,633
I'll just... I'll go
find it myself.

239
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:19,967
How hard can it be?

240
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:23,387
As hard as that desk
you just walked into?

241
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,592
Good burn, Mickey.

242
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:31,562
You deserve a little
nightstand fudge for that one.

243
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,963
<i>Where do I look?</i>

244
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,649
<i>I mean, I can't look</i>
<i>at her chest.</i>

245
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,017
<i>Damn it! I just did.</i>

246
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,818
<i>Maybe Robin didn't notice.</i>

247
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,637
<i>Man, he's really up</i>
<i>in those jugs.</i>

248
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,990
Shake it, baby!

249
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,808
A playa's gotta play!

250
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,277
<i>This is weird.</i>

251
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,579
<i>I'll just look her</i>
<i>in the eyes.</i>

252
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:52,333
<i>Is he falling in love</i>
<i>with this stripper?</i>

253
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:53,650
<i>Quick, do something cool.</i>

254
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,037
Make it rain, son!

255
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,338
Money ain't no thang!

256
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,258
<i>Damn it,</i>
<i>there was a 20 in there.</i>

257
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,000
Hello, Mr. Eriksen.

258
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,602
From the sound
of the wind chimes,

259
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,854
I hear you've made it
to the first floor.

260
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,940
Okay... you know what, Mickey?

261
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:19,643
You can save the creepy
game master routine.

262
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:22,563
It's only kind of
terrifying me.

263
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:25,032
Oh, but the game has just begun.

264
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,851
I call it "Try Not to Bang into
All the Furniture and Stuff

265
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:32,356
on Your Way to the Fuse Box
in the Basement, Marshall."

266
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,625
That's just a working title.

267
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,127
Hey!

268
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,080
Got a little boob glitter
on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy.

269
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:41,031
Straight pimpin'.

270
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:43,134
Barney, you got
a little bit, too.

271
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,386
Where?

272
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:48,055
Did I get it?

273
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,206
Yeah, you got it.

274
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,808
Who needs Marshall
and Lily?

275
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,727
We got a new gang,

276
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:55,312
and we're all going to
hang out together forever.

277
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:56,764
My shift is done.

278
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:57,932
Good-bye.

279
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,550
Wait, stop!

280
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:02,052
Technically, this song's not
over, so we still own you.

281
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,155
Plus we're best friends!

282
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,940
Where to next?

283
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:07,441
We go to underground
poker game

284
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:09,777
in mostly-abandoned
insane asylum.

285
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,445
Yes!

286
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:13,531
This is gonna be awesome,

287
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,549
and when it is, I want
you all to remember

288
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,868
who led you there:
Barney Stinson,

289
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,754
new group leader.

290
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:31,515
Yay!

291
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:34,751
I'm winning all
your chippies!

292
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:37,772
Let's not drink
when we're...

293
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:38,773
I'm thirsty; it's good.

294
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:40,107
It's good.

295
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:42,977
Marshall, I just remembered

296
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,030
I saw a box of matches
in the drawer by the trash can.

297
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:48,232
Okay, thanks, baby.

298
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,374
Lily, I can't find them.

299
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,710
Looking for these?

300
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:03,464
Oh, right, you can't see me.

301
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:07,384
Um, well, I'm burning the
matches you so desperately need.

302
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:13,274
Aah, ooh, ow!

303
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,142
Ow.

304
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,177
Hah! Oh!

305
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:20,130
Mickey... guess who found
the basement stairs?

306
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,466
I'll be down
at that fuse box in no time,

307
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,801
and when I get there,

308
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,971
I'm sure that I'll figure out
how fuse boxes work,

309
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:29,306
so it'll be fine.

310
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:30,658
Hey, Marshall,

311
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,910
I know I've been
messing with you,

312
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:35,312
but seriously,
that second step, don't...

313
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,414
I don't want to hear it, Mickey.

314
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,420
Oh, my knee!

315
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,372
Ow!

316
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:48,592
And watch out for my drum set.

317
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:52,179
I win again!

318
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,430
I was bluffing.

319
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:55,316
I didn't even have enough cards.

320
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,003
Ted, please stop winning.

321
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:02,556
Hey, look, it's the
New York City skyline.

322
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:04,558
♪ We built Chip City

323
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,693
Uh, uh!

324
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:09,029
♪ We built Chip City
on all your dough ♪

325
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:11,398
♪ Built Chip City
Hit it!

326
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,343
You know Butterfly-knife.

327
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:22,378
I'd expect this
from Face Tattoo...

328
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,197
or Jagged Cheek Scar,

329
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:26,933
or Larry,

330
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:27,767
but not you.

331
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,668
Why don't I get nickname?

332
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,137
Because you have too
many things, Larry.

333
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,355
You get one thing!

334
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,347
See, that's why
you bring New Marshall.

335
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:50,356
We go to party in
slaughterhouse.

336
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:51,858
You come?

337
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,293
<i>Please, God, no.</i>

338
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:59,499
<i>Don't let me be in charge</i>
<i>of the gang anymore.</i>

339
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,918
<i>I can't believe Dr. Kevin</i>
<i>doesn't remember me</i>

340
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,387
<i>from our sessions</i>
<i>three years ago.</i>

341
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,505
<i>Is that the lunatic</i>

342
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,890
<i>that stabbed</i>
<i>all those prison guards?</i>

343
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,092
<i>We gotta hit that party!</i>

344
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,427
<i>I'll never find love.</i>

345
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,712
We got to hit that party!

346
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:15,982
Sweet.

347
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,851
Lily?

348
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:22,438
I think we made a mistake
moving out to the suburbs.

349
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,407
I miss our home.

350
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:27,360
I miss our booth
with our friends.

351
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,082
And I'm pretty sure I have
a drumstick...

352
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:35,735
somewhere bad.

353
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:38,070
Dad, why are you
acting like this?

354
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:40,239
Well, I was just
trying to be helpful,

355
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,625
but you guys want me out
by the Fourth of July.

356
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:43,676
Tomorrow.

357
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,512
You know what
a helpful father,

358
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,965
not to mention grandfather,
might do?

359
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,517
Get these lights back on.

360
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:58,558
Okay, Marshall, listen up.

361
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,643
I'm gonna get you
to that fuse box.

362
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,646
Can't you just come down here
and do it for me, please?

363
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:05,698
I don't know anything
about this house.

364
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,899
No, Marshall...

365
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:10,152
you don't know anything
about <i>your</i> house.

366
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:16,609
All right, we got a lot
of work to do.

367
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:19,328
Wait here,
we get you

368
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,614
on VPI list for party.

369
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:25,134
You give us, uh,
$200 per person.

370
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:26,335
Cover charge.

371
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:28,754
That's pretty steep
for a cover charge.

372
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:30,923
Is very good party.

373
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:35,828
Is party for, uh, New York
"Yunkees" and Coca-Cola.

374
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,179
Oh, my God.

375
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,181
A Coca-Cola Yankees party?

376
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:41,400
That sounds like a real thing.

377
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,672
Okay, now, Marshall,
take three steps forward,

378
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:49,775
while ducking underneath
the broken ceiling fan.

379
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:52,011
Now look to your left

380
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,030
and spit.

381
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:56,666
That's the water heater.

382
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,117
Want to stay away from that.

383
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:02,371
That baby is hotter than the
Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.

384
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:06,509
Okay, now past the washer and
dryer is the hardest part.

385
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:09,845
You're gonna have to belly-crawl
underneath the ping-pong table

386
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:11,764
and don't so much as nudge it.

387
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:12,848
Why not?

388
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,685
Because there are
900 dominos set up

389
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:17,520
in the shape of Barbara Eden.

390
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,139
Big, big <i>I Dream Of Jeannie</i> fan.

391
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,144
I'm clear.

392
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:33,235
I don't know what
that sound is, Mickey.

393
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:35,354
That's the sound of Barbara
Eden never banging me.

394
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:36,405
That's what that is.

395
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,324
Dad, get it back.

396
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:41,460
Come on.

397
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:44,046
Okay, Marshall,

398
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,748
take three steps forward,

399
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,167
and you should be
at the fuse box.

400
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,336
Do you think he made it?

401
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:55,558
I did it!

402
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,009
No, Marshall...

403
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:59,228
<i>you</i> did it.

404
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,683
<i>that night inspired</i>

00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:05,851

410
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,700
Well, judging from
how many clients

411
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:22,568
that hooker has serviced,

412
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,170
I'd say we've been
here almost an hour.

413
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:26,288
Ted, we've been robbed.

414
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,408
Better Lily and New Marshall
would never rob us.

415
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,327
They're our best friends.

416
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,417
Damn it, Ted.

417
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,886
New Marshall is
an escaped zoo bear

418
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:44,190
and the only thing that Better
Lily is better at than our Lily

419
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,891
is over-the-pants hand stuff.

420
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:48,260
I'm assuming.

421
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,445
I'll admit it.

422
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,946
I can't lead this group.

423
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,732
We need Marshall and Lily.

424
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,600
But they're gone, aren't they?

425
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:57,069
I mean, it'll go from seeing
them a couple times a week,

426
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,871
to a couple times a month,

427
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:01,207
and then it'll just
be holiday parties.

428
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:04,076
Then the years pass,

429
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,745
and you find out
Marshall's dead,

430
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:08,297
and you're there for Lily
emotionally at first,

431
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,617
but then it becomes sexual,
and you feel guilty,

432
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,587
but maybe that guilt just makes
it dirtier and better...

433
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:15,954
No, I won't let that happen.

434
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:17,506
Especially that last part.

435
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:21,126
Look, I know I've been a little
drunk and naive tonight,

436
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:22,178
but here's what's gonna happen.

437
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,512
First, we're gonna leave a note

438
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:25,564
for Better Lily and Arvydas,
they're worriers.

439
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,016
Oh, buddy.
Then,

440
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,769
we're gonna go see Only Marshall
and One-Of-A-Kind Lily

441
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,136
because they're our best friends

442
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:32,471
and they're only
46 minutes away.

443
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:33,739
Are you with me?

444
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:36,025
Kind of resent the power grab,
but okay, let's go!

445
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:37,142
Hey,

446
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:38,994
do you want to come to
Long Island with us?

447
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:42,448
Uh, well, still a few more
hours before the sun comes up.

448
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,166
So...

449
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:45,751
No.
No?

450
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:46,652
Is that bad?

451
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:49,371
No, it's great.

452
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:50,840
Ooh, that felt so good.

453
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,158
I hate doing things
and going anywhere!

454
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,426
Oh, new experiences suck!

455
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,847
While we're at it,
I hate high-fiving you!

456
00:18:57,849 --> 00:18:59,014
I know.

457
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,382
We're adults who are
sleeping together,

458
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,218
not teens pledging a frat.

459
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:10,392
<i>Oh, man, I really</i>
<i>liked the high-five.</i>

460
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:14,680
<i>The next morning, Marshall</i>
<i>and Lily woke up to a surprise.</i>

461
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:23,772
Hey, what are... what
are you guys doing here?

462
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:28,160
Just wanted to make
sure this key worked.

463
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:30,529
We missed you.

464
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:32,631
Give mama a hug.

465
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,701
Oh...

466
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,469
Don't check your voicemail.

467
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:39,255
Y-You might have
a couple weird ones.

468
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,890
You hear this?!

469
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:42,992
This is the sound
of me moving on.

470
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:52,101
Yeah, I'm a stripper.

471
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,137
Okay, who wants pancakes?

472
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,441
Which two of you want pancakes?

473
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:00,576
I'll make more.

474
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:01,610
Oh, good-good-good,
'cause I want pancakes.

475
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:02,695
There you go.

476
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:03,946
Thank you, okay.

477
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:05,381
Enjoy them.

478
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,149
Hey, honey, look,

479
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:08,617
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.

480
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:11,003
Okay? I'll leave
right after breakfast.

481
00:20:11,005 --> 00:20:12,671
I'll crash with some friends.

482
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:14,123
Dad, you know what?

483
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,407
You can stay.

484
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:16,258
Oh, thank God.

485
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,243
I got no friends.

486
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,095
I'll be here two weeks, tops.

487
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:23,132
<i>It wasn't two weeks.</i>

488
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,917
<i>Would the five</i>
<i>of us always live</i>

489
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,852
<i>within a few minutes</i>
<i>of that booth?</i>

490
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:30,845
<i>No, that's life, kids,</i>
<i>but here's what I discovered.</i>

491
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:34,340
<i>Our booth was wherever</i>
<i>the five of us were together.</i>

That's right, Widow Rodriguez.

494
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:44,196
Stretch it.

495
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:45,847
Work those gams.

496
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,716
Ooh, yeah.

497
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:49,401
Grab that left arm.

498
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:51,703
Clutch that chest.

499
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:54,249
Fall down really fast.
