00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,510
<i>your Uncle Barney went off</i>
<i>the grid for a couple weeks.</i>

3
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:08,548
<i>So I was relieved</i>
<i>when I got a text</i>

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,217
<i>asking me to come over</i>
<i>to his place.</i>

5
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,852
Glad to hear from you, buddy.

6
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:14,771
I was worried something
bad happened...

7
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:16,890
...to you.

8
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,424
Welcome, brother.

9
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:19,776
What is this?

10
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:23,447
Ted Evelyn Mosby,

11
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:24,698
you are about to be
sworn to secrecy

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,784
through the sacred vows
of a Bro Oath,

13
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:30,070
or "Broath."

14
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,957
Please, put on
your "brobe."

15
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,126
Yeah, I'm not putting on
the "brobe."

16
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,828
Ted, just...

17
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,280
just... Okay?

18
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:43,500
♪ Broooo... ♪

19
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:46,253
Wait, are they chanting "bro"?

20
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,620
♪ Bro... ♪

21
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:49,622
I got some local monks
to record this.

22
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:51,258
Yeah! I got a monk guy.

23
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,259
Cool, right?

24
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,510
It actually is, yeah.

25
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,728
I'll burn it for you.

26
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,563
Just remind me after The Broath.

27
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,149
Anyway, Ted Evelyn Mosby,

28
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:04,470
this ritual forever binds you
to keep a solemn secret...

29
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:05,772
Which is?

30
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,407
I really like this Quinn girl!

31
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,526
We've been spending
tons of time together,

32
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,977
and I want the gang to meet her.

33
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,746
but I'm afraid they're
gonna disapprove because,

34
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:16,166
- well, you know.
<i>- I did know. You see,</i>

35
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:17,801
<i>Quinn was a stripper...</i>

36
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:20,871
<i>who had swindled Barney out of</i>
<i>quite a bit of cash.</i>

37
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,789
We're inviting everyone
to dinner at Quinn's,

38
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,508
and I want them to
keep an open mind,

39
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,992
which brings us to The Broath.

40
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:29,129
Place your hand
on The Bro Code.

41
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,847
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

42
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:32,999
Repeat after me.

43
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,720
I, Ted Evelyn Mosby...

44
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:40,974
"I, Ted "Why Did I Ever Tell You
My Middle Name" Mosby..."

45
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,610
...solemnly swear not to
tell our friends

46
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:45,011
that Quinn is
a stripper.

47
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,013
"...solemnly swear not
to tell our friends

48
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:50,066
that Quinn is a stripper" who
duped you out of lots of money.

49
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,651
You're only supposed
to repeat after me.

50
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,153
"You're only supposed
to repeat after me."

51
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,154
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

52
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,489
Silence!

53
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,459
Look, I know that things
started out sketchy

54
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:01,795
with me and Quinn, but
I really like her, so please.

55
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:03,696
Do you,

56
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:07,968
Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby,

57
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,221
swear to uphold this Broath?

58
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:13,440
I do.

59
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:16,476
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

62
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,575
Okay, time to go to
Quinn's. Now remember,

63
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:33,126
I told you nothing, okay?

64
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:34,861
Barney really wants
us all to like her.

65
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,246
But how can we?

66
00:02:36,248 --> 00:02:38,832
Quinn totally duped Barney,
and he couldn't even see it.

67
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:41,201
Well, apparently, the sex
is mind-blowing.

68
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,037
Ha, I've been there.
Yeah.

69
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,672
I was once with this chick

70
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:48,508
who answered the door wearing
nothing but, uh, whipped cream,

71
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,877
a dog collar
and a hot pink thong.

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,095
Marshall,

73
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:53,880
you can't tell sex stories

74
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,265
about "this chick," because

75
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,749
everyone knows it's me.

76
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:58,584
I'm the only woman
you've ever been with.

77
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:01,421
It's not fair, the guys are
always telling their sex stories

78
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:03,023
and I can top
every one of them.

79
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:06,226
Baby, you're like 20 slutty
chicks all rolled into one.

80
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,478
Sweet talk is not going
to change my mind.

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,763
Let's focus.

82
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,115
Tonight, we want to make sure

83
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:14,367
that Quinn is not
out to scam Barney.

84
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,453
So, when we walk back
through that door

85
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,822
three hours from now,
we should all be able

86
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,041
to answer one
simple question:

87
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:25,211
Do we trust this girl?

88
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:26,413
Well, for one thing,

89
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,298
she seems kind of controlling.

90
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,451
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

91
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:32,836
No, save it for dessert.

92
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,254
Idiot.

93
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:38,174
Uh, ah...

94
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,260
More red wine, beauty-swan?

95
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,795
She drinks a lot.

96
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:45,398
Is it okay if I
go pee, sugar lamb?

97
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,466
No!

98
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:48,134
You just went three hours ago.

99
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,103
You're right, baby bear!

100
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,276
Yes, so Barney's whipped;
it doesn't mean

101
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,361
that Quinn is a con artist.

102
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,813
Well, maybe we could've gotten
a better read on her

103
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:03,500
if two people
hadn't gone off topic.

104
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:06,036
By the way, Quinn,
your apartment is amazing.

105
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,653
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

106
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:09,923
I'm actually moving out soon.

107
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:11,708
If you know anyone
looking for a sublet,

108
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,676
this place is rent-controlled.

109
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:14,344
You would not believe
what I pay.

110
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:16,162
<i>Kids,</i>
<i>things have been tense</i>

111
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,797
<i>between Robin and I for weeks.</i>

112
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,516
<i>Ever since she moved out,</i>

113
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:22,102
<i>and I gave the apartment</i>
<i>to Marshall and Lily,</i>

114
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:24,688
<i>I'd been crashing</i>
<i>in university housing.</i>

115
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,856
It's 10:00,
damn it.

116
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,341
Ned, Martin and Millie,

117
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,009
people are trying to sleep!

118
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,113
Hey, you were young
like us once, right?

119
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:36,483
I was never like you guys.

120
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,703
<i>And Robin was staying</i>
<i>with her coworker, Patrice.</i>

121
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,454
You seem so down today, Robin.

122
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:42,906
I made you cookies.

123
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,525
Damn it, Patrice,
stop smothering me!

124
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:49,212
<i>So, when Quinn said</i>
<i>her apartment was available...</i>

125
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:52,499
It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!

126
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,633
Dibs! Dibs! Dibs!

127
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:56,636
We got off topic?
What about Marshall?

128
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,338
Hey, I was just
going along with

129
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,557
whoever suggested
we play that game.

130
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,841
Hey, let's play a game!

131
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,427
Uh, craziest
sex-in-public story; I'll start.

132
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,229
I was once with this chick

133
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,648
who loved to get freaky
in elevators.

134
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,049
Doors would close;
suddenly,

135
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:13,269
she's panting on all fours
like a dog in heat.

136
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,357
Marshall, stop.

137
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,942
I never said that it was you.

138
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,944
Okay, so anyway, last August,

139
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,163
I go bareback
with this same slut.

140
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:26,116
She get's pregnant;
bitch is even hornier.

141
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:28,901
Oh, yeah? I was once
with this dude

142
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:31,037
who I caught eating
a sandwich during sex.

143
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,505
Big ol' meatball

144
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:34,507
falls out, lands on my back,

145
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,742
rolls on to the elevator floor.

146
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:38,911
Hmm. Disgusting, right?

147
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:42,682
What, I never said it was you.

148
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:45,885
Yeah, sorry we didn't stay
as laser-focused as you guys.

149
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,254
Hey, at least I got
some evidence.

150
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:50,857
Look what I found
in Quinn's bedroom.

151
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,776
Barney's taking her to Hawaii.

152
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:54,694
Lily, you snooped
through her stuff?

153
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,980
No. It's like
the first thing you see

154
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,699
when you jimmy open her desk
drawer with a letter opener

155
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,435
her grandfather left her,
according to her diary.

156
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:03,870
First-class tickets,

157
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:06,239
a four-star hotel--
this cost Barney a fortune.

158
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,942
Yeah, this proves that Quinn is
totally using him for his money.

159
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,444
You know what Lily, enough.

160
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:13,946
Guys, even if you're right
about Quinn, this is Barney.

161
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:15,081
He'll come to his senses.

162
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,584
I give this whole thing
a week, two weeks, tops.

163
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,969
And now, we have
an announcement.

164
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:20,753
Can I tell them?

165
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,422
No.

166
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,590
We're moving in together
We're m...

167
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,310
Congrats! That's great.
So happy for you.

168
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:28,961
We gotta end this.

169
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:30,997
Yup.

170
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,484
<i>Kids, as you'll recall,</i>

171
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:38,341
<i>our gang had a subtle way</i>
<i>of letting someone know</i>

172
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,126
<i>they were making a mistake.</i>

173
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:42,931
Where have you been?

174
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,302
Oh, worth it. Hang on.

175
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,421
Hey.

176
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,046
You know we would've
hated ourselves, right?

177
00:06:57,732 --> 00:06:59,382
So,

178
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:02,352
did Robin tell you the incredibly
devious thing she did today?

179
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,537
Me?!

180
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:06,907
Hey, so I just happened
to be in the neighborhood

181
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,693
and I thought, "Man, Quinn
is in such great shape,

182
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,561
she must love fruit."

183
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,247
So, unrelated,

184
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,999
how's the search for
a sub-letter going?

185
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:19,503
This is such a
weird coincidence!

186
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,788
Robin also "just happened"
to be in the neighborhood

187
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,575
with a bottle of wine
and her credit scores.

188
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,300
I can't believe you two.

189
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,602
What do you care about more,
protecting your friend

190
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:38,388
from getting hurt or scoring
this girl's apartment?

191
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,973
There's a working fireplace!

192
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:42,726
Patrice is ironing
my pants all wrong!

193
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,561
You guys should be ashamed.

194
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,363
Speaking of shame,

195
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,932
I was once with this chick
who liked to do hand stuff

196
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,650
underneath a jacket
while we were all

197
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:52,452
sitting around our
favorite booth at MacLaren's.

198
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:53,620
Gross.

199
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:55,455
We share appetizers.

200
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:58,208
Okay, well, I was once
with a dude

201
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,777
who couldn't even fantasize
about a three-way.

202
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,080
He was all,
"Ew, she's your best friend."

203
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,047
What now?

204
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,465
I was once with a
chick who wanted

205
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:08,552
to get it on during a school
production of <i>Peter</i> <i>Pan.</i>

206
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,604
Well, I...
Wait, that wasn't me.

207
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,890
So, back to Patrice
and this ironing issue...

208
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,593
I thought I was the first girl
you ever did anything with.

209
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,011
Anything serious.

210
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,563
Please don't tell me that
you're jealous of me getting

211
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,816
to second base in tenth grade
with Jenna Cristalli.

212
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:26,103
Don't say that whore's name
in front of our baby.

213
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,488
What's going on?

214
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,325
Barney, this in an intervention.

215
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,146
A "Quinntervention."

216
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:40,316
You and Quinn are moving really
fast, and we don't trust her.

217
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,352
We're just looking out
for your best interests.

218
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,858
"Quinn-terests."

219
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,093
I don't understand. Wh...

220
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,845
Wait a sec.

221
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:54,264
Ted Evelyn Mosby...

222
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,883
you broke The Broath.

223
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:58,468
How dare you?!

224
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,806
A Broath is the most sacred bond
between-- okay, yeah, I did.

225
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,675
Are you aware that
breaking a Broath

226
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:09,479
can have deadly,
even fatal repercussions?

227
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,515
Have you studied history, Ted?

228
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,183
Extensively.
But I'm a little shaky

229
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,517
on fake history, so...

230
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,399
The tragic cost of
a broken Broath

231
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,038
Uh-huh.

232
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,874
dates back to
Ancient Bro-man times...

233
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,795
Hey, Bro-tus,

234
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,214
you'd tell me if,
like, a bunch of dudes

235
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,633
were conspiring to
assassinate me, right?

236
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,053
Um, totally, Caesar.

237
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,472
Paranoid much?

238
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,707
Just to be sure,

239
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,060
can you swear
a Broath to me?

240
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:42,345
Sure. I swear.

241
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,714
Thanks.

242
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,933
You've always got my back.

243
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:10,540
<i>Et tu, Bro-te?</i>

244
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:17,430
And then he banged,
like, a hundred chicks

245
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,599
and invented a salad.

246
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:21,084
True story.

247
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,187
Well, Quinn lied to you;
she manipulated you.

248
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,856
What if she's just using you?

249
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,274
She's not just using me.

250
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:29,092
What about the expensive
trip to Hawaii?

251
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,695
What expensive trip to Hawaii?

252
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,030
The one I got for you.

253
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,117
That was supposed to be
a surprise for Barney.

254
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,569
He asked me to meet him here.

255
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,938
What's going on, you guys?

256
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,790
Tell her.

257
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:47,110
Fine,
I'll fill her in.

258
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:49,246
And I am so angry,

259
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,415
I'm not even gonna make a joke
about "filling her in."

260
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,801
Which I did three times
last night, self-five.

261
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:57,470
My friends think
you're wrong for me,

262
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,422
so they're having
an intervention.

263
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:04,427
A "Quinntervention."

264
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,096
I don't understand.

265
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,848
Well, see, your name
is Quinn, and so...

266
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,517
I'll explain.

267
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,738
I made Ted promise not to tell
them what you do, but he did,

268
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,439
and now they don't trust you.

269
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:19,943
Wow, that really hurts.

270
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,127
But what's even worse

271
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,314
is that you felt
the need to lie about me.

272
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,616
I'm not ashamed of
who I am, Barney,

273
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,651
but you clearly are.

274
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:29,836
I'm not ashamed of you.

275
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:32,088
I just didn't want them
to judge you without...

276
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,924
Maybe we are moving too fast.

277
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,992
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

278
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:37,961
I don't think I can do this.

279
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,348
Wait, are you ending things
just like that?

280
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,634
If you walk out that door,
you prove them right.

281
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,519
You prove that you're just
some heartless stripper

282
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,788
who never gave a damn about me
in the...

283
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,343
Don't call me.

284
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:59,849
Wow. That
was intense.

285
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,758
We just destroyed
what could have been

286
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,611
a once-in-a-lifetime shot
at happiness.

287
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:14,913
I know. I feel guilty, too.

288
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,449
Fireplace, balcony,

289
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:18,984
hardwood floors...

290
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:20,919
Okay, I'll just say it:

291
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,521
After everything that
happened between us,

292
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:23,572
I can't believe
you wouldn't

293
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:26,024
back down and let me
have Quinn's place.

294
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:29,027
Ted, can I talk to you
out in the hall?

295
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:33,415
Has it ever occurred to you

296
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:36,368
that the last few weeks haven't
been easy for me either?

297
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,005
In the span of one day,
my engagement fell apart,

298
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:42,758
I lost my best friend,
then I lost my apartment.

299
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,060
And-and now I'm about
to lose my job.

300
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,094
What do you mean?

301
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,399
I-I've been completely
distracted at work.

302
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:53,802
And now my boss wants to see me
Friday at 5:00,

303
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:57,022
which, around the office,
is known as "fire o'clock."

304
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:58,807
I had no idea.

305
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,075
How could you?

306
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:03,395
The one person I want to talk
to most barely looks me

307
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:05,998
in the eye anymore,
much less returns my calls.

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,451
Ted, I know it took guts
to tell me you love me.

309
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:13,271
And I-I know how much it hurt
that I didn't say it back,

310
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:14,873
but...

311
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,810
Damn it, th-this sucks
for me, too.

312
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,546
And I-I miss you.

313
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:27,953
Is there any way we can just...
go back to normal?

314
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:33,392
I don't think
I can do normal anymore.

315
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,764
Barney still
isn't answering.

316
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:41,633
We gotta go find him
and apologize.

317
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:47,823
Oh. I thought you were Quinn.

318
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,075
Barney, we're so sorry.

319
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:52,143
We never should've
meddled like that.

320
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:53,912
Can you forgive us?
I don't know.

321
00:13:53,914 --> 00:13:55,697
You had no right to do that.

322
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,499
How can we make it
up to you, buddy?

323
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:03,288
I, one of Barney's
best friends...

324
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,124
"I, one of Barney's
best friends..."

325
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:09,878
...promise never to interfere
with his personal life again...

326
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,116
"...promise never to interfere
with his personal life again..."

327
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:17,719
...unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

328
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,521
or he's about to get up
on a fattie.

329
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:24,008
"...unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

330
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,011
or he's about to
get up on a fattie."

331
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:31,400
And now, to seal
this sacred vow,

332
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,201
the two ladies will kiss.
Barney...

333
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:36,020
The two ladies will kiss!

334
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:41,293
Mmm.

335
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,862
Lil...

336
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:45,414
Okay.

337
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,698
And now the gentlemen.

338
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,966
Dude...

339
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:50,335
And now the gentlemen!

340
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:54,723
Let's just...
This is silly.

341
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,977
Don't-don't touch
my face.

342
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:03,882
I was going to say,

343
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,550
"And now the gentlemen
bump fists."

344
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,352
How long you been holding
back that one?

345
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:10,605
Hot stuff, fellas.

346
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,641
Did I see a little tongue
in there?

347
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,243
I don't understand.

348
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:16,495
Well, if these two

349
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:18,580
will keep their sweaty paws
off each other

350
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,831
for half a second, I'll explain.

351
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,733
It all started
a couple days ago...

352
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:23,401
I want you to meet
my friends.

353
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:25,003
Should I be nervous?

354
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,922
Is it like bringing me home
to meet your parents?

355
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,039
No, no, no.

356
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,574
Much more stressful than that.

357
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:32,010
You see, my friends, while
awesome, can be presumptuous,

358
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:34,346
meddlesome and
downright destructive.

359
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:36,765
When they learn what
you do and how we met,

360
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,216
they'll probably try
to break us up.

361
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,435
So let's have
some fun with them.

362
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:41,920
Mess with their heads.

363
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:45,056
Are you saying...
evil plan?

364
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:46,691
Hells to the yes.

365
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,894
My God, you're hot.

366
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:49,928
Wait for it.

367
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,613
Here's what we do.

368
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:54,950
<i>I'll make Ted swear not to tell</i>
<i>anyone what he knows about you,</i>

369
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:56,601
<i>and he'll cave immediately.</i>

370
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:58,687
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

371
00:15:58,689 --> 00:15:59,688
<i>Next, we invite everyone over.</i>

372
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,323
<i>I'll keep saying stuff like:</i>

373
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,291
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

374
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:04,793
<i>And I'll be the bossy</i>
<i>bitch who says:</i>

375
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:07,329
No, save it for dessert, idiot.

376
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,613
<i>Nice.</i>

377
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:09,998
<i>And, finally, we'll announce...</i>

378
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,566
We're moving in together!

379
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,918
I've got an idea.

380
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,586
Let's get your friends
Ted and Robin

381
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:15,887
fighting over my apartment.

382
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,956
Wait, what does that have
to do with you and me?

383
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,474
Nothing. I just
worship chaos.

384
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,309
I can't handle how hot
you are right now.

385
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:23,512
Wait for it.
Next,

386
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:26,181
<i>they'll try to talk me</i>
<i>into dumping you.</i>

387
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,465
<i>And I'll walk in on it.</i>

388
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,400
<i>Then we pretend to break up.</i>

389
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:30,018
<i>And when they crawl back,</i>

390
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,386
<i>begging for forgiveness...</i>

391
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:33,522
<i>I'll be the bigger man</i>
<i>and let them off the hook.</i>

392
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,991
<i>Or make the monkeys</i>
<i>dance for you.</i>

393
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,943
<i>God, you're smart!</i>

394
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:40,412
It's gonna be legen...

395
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:43,198
I'm not waiting for
it anymore. Mmm...

396
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,350
...dary.

397
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:48,987
My God, you two are...

398
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:50,505
Perfect together.

399
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:52,457
So you're not really moving in?

400
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,009
Well, it started
out as a joke,

401
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:55,794
but the more we
talked about it...

402
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,345
The more excited we got.

403
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:59,664
So, yeah, we are.

404
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,767
You have anything
to say about that?

405
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:05,687
So happy for you.
Congratulations.

406
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:08,773
Thank you.

407
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,275
Thank you.

408
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,144
You two realize this means

409
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:15,463
my apartment really is
up for grabs, right?

410
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,817
I'm sure I'll find
something else.

411
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,485
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

412
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:24,122
<i>And that's the story</i>
<i>of how we met Quinn.</i>

413
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:28,126
<i>That Friday, I met Robin to see</i>
<i>how it went at "fire o'clock."</i>

414
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:31,362
They promoted me
to on-air talent.

415
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:33,364
I'm gonna be
Sandy Rivers' new co-host.

416
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:34,699
Oh, my God!

417
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:35,867
How'd that happen?

418
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:36,918
Remember New Year's Eve?

419
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,370
<i>When I filled in for Sandy,</i>
<i>it turns out</i>

420
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,706
the C.E.O.
of <i>World Wide News</i> liked me.

421
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,207
He said I have "moxie."

422
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,010
So he's a 1940s gangster?

423
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:46,377
Apparently.

424
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:49,213
And I got a big raise,

425
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:52,651
so I'm taking this apartment
on Central Park West,

426
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:53,735
which means...

427
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,103
Quinn's apartment.

428
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,504
I already told her
you'd take it.

429
00:17:56,506 --> 00:18:00,075
Wow. Thanks.

430
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,076
Yeah.

431
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,393
Hey, and congrats.

432
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:04,145
You deserve it all.

433
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:09,734
You know, I've been
thinking about it, and...

434
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:11,252
I can do normal.

435
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:13,288
To back to normal.

436
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,122
To back to normal.

437
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:26,084
Uh... I-I should get going.
Yeah.

438
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,519
You've got a lot to do.
Totally.

439
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:28,920
So...
Um, see you soon.

440
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:29,754
See you soon.

441
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,255
Yeah.

442
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:33,558
<i>We wouldn't see each other</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

443
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,594
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

444
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,396
Listen, um...

445
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:41,099
about me getting to second base
in tenth grade

446
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,433
with Jenna Cristalli...

447
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:43,952
I don't know what you're
talking about.

448
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,454
I've already forgotten
about that dumb hobag.

449
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:50,274
Yeah, um, it didn't happen while
we were watching <i>Peter Pan.</i>

450
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:54,278
It happened while I was
playing Peter Pan.

451
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,549
Here's a photo
from the day I was cast.

452
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,784
That's me in the middle.

453
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:01,786
But then I had my growth spurt.

454
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:05,140
By opening night, I was too big
for the flying harness,

455
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,308
and, well...

456
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:13,765
I fell hands-first
right onto Jenna Cristalli.

457
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,851
The tissues in her bra saved me
two broken wrists.

458
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,269
I'm sorry. I just, I just wanted

459
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,739
to have one cool
sex story that wasn't you.

460
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:24,025
Okay. Next time you tell it,
you were in your dad's car,

461
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:27,162
which you stole to go
to a Metallica concert,

462
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:31,332
and you got to third base
with that slut.

463
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:35,954
I was once with this chick...

464
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:39,741
who is just
the best wife ever.

465
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:45,513
Thank you for being so cool
about what I do.

466
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,549
A lot of guys would be
weird or jealous.

467
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:48,683
Are you kidding?

468
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:51,002
Who am I to judge
anyone? I'm the devil!

469
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:56,524
I mean, if you ever

470
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,509
wanted to stop stripping,
I'd support it.

471
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,979
- If you wanted... to.
- Uh-huh.

472
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:03,114
So, you are jealous?

473
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,200
What? No, no, not at all.

474
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:07,202
I'm just saying,
if you ever wanted to hang up

475
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,904
the ol' G-string,
I'd completely understand.

476
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:12,791
Nah, I like taking my clothes
off for money.

477
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:13,825
Great.

478
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:16,244
Let me... let me finish.

479
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:20,865
Hypothetically,
what would make you stop?

480
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,134
Hypothetically...

481
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:28,206
I would stop stripping
if I ever got married.

482
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,474
Good night.

483
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:39,119
And then we agreed
to "go back to normal."

484
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:46,169
But I'm starting to wonder if we
can ever really just be friends.

485
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:51,591
Anyway, that's the story of me
and Robin, 2005 to the present.

486
00:20:51,593 --> 00:20:52,926
What do you think?

487
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:55,045
I think your stories
are way too long.

488
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:59,482
I feel bad
for his future kids, dude.

489
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:04,487
Hey, my kids are gonna
love my stories.

490
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:08,408
They're gonna... yeah, they're
gonna love my stories.
