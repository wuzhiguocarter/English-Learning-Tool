1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,723
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Is it about the bees?

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:05,693
Bees?
We're throwing

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,373
a housewarming party
in two weeks.

4
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:09,613
It's gonna be friends,
neighbors...

5
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:11,115
Did he say...
did he say "bees"?

6
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:14,535
Yeah. Marshall's been working
very long hours lately,

7
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:17,571
so I have been planning
this whole party by myself,

8
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:20,424
and everything's in place:
the food, the wine.

9
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:23,577
I even found a rare
Gouda on the Internet.

10
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:25,963
Getting back
to these bees...

11
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,015
Bottom line: this party
is very important to me,

12
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:32,519
so I can only assume--
and I say this with love--

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,921
you're gonna ruin it.

14
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:36,840
Lily, I promise I won't ruin
your party.

15
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,592
I'll be charming and convivial.

16
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:39,944
A regular Burt Reynolds.

17
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,645
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

18
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,747
Tell us about the bees!

19
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,950
Well, all right,
since you asked.

20
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,284
I'm starting up a business

21
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:49,987
cultivating all-organic,
artisanal honey.

22
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:52,790
That's right,
I'm a job creator.

23
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,125
Oh.
So this party...

24
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,961
Oh, Lily, wait.
Um, if you don't mind,

25
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,413
I just,
I have one follow-up.

26
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,216
Where are you doing
this exactly?

27
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,135
Downstairs-- there's 10,000 bees
in the basement.

Happy housewarming!

32
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,273
Hey, guys.

33
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,440
Robin here has spent

34
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:29,543
all day learning
how to make kugel.

35
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,328
Couldn't figure it out--
this is from Zabar's.

36
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,996
Can we heat it up
in your oven?

37
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:35,666
Faster than heating it up
in the refrigerator.

38
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:37,801
I've had a few cocktails.

39
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:39,403
I got it.
Take that.

40
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:42,622
<i>Kids, someday</i>
<i>you're gonna throw a party,</i>

41
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:44,391

42
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,176

43
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:48,128
<i>Well, don't.</i>

44
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,765
<i>What you should worry about</i>
<i>is everything going wrong.</i>

45
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:55,602
<i>And what's really scary</i>

46
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:57,404

<i>housewarming party</i>

47
00:01:57,406 --> 00:02:00,941

48
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:04,094
<i>Now, a lot happened</i>

49
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:08,081

50
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,150
<i>We'll start in the living room.</i>

51
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,788
Oh, no,
that's not what you want.

52
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,957
- What?
- Oh, nothing. So, you think

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,125
this is going pretty well?

54
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:19,426
Baby, are you kidding?

55
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:21,661
You single-handedly pulled off
the party of the year.

56
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:24,381
Oh, stop it.
I used both hands.

57
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:25,832
So, what can I do to help?

58
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:28,852
Honey, this is your first night
off in however long.

59
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:31,722
You just relax and keep knocking
back those cocktails.

60
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:33,223
Mr. Cootes.

61
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:36,276
Hey, isn't it nice
to finally have a night off?

62
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:38,395
It is.
But tonight is not <i>that</i> night.

63
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:40,513
We're going back to the office
in 45 minutes.

64
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,515
But, sir, this is
our housewarming party.

65
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:45,018
You know,
Mother Earth is also having

66
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,404
a "housewarming" party, too,

67
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:51,408
only hers ends with humankind
at the bottom of a rising ocean,

68
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,244
passing through the digestive
tract of a stingray.

69
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:56,880
By the way,
it's a lovely home.

70
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:00,917
Mr. Cootes,
I know you're a vegan, so I, uh,

71
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,254
I got some vegan spring rolls
for you over there.

72
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:06,390
Oh, nummies!

73
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,259
You're going
back to work?

74
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:12,145
Sheez, Marshall,
you are as busy as a...

75
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:15,732
Oh, gosh,
what are you as busy as?

76
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:16,933
Please don't talk about
the bees.

77
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,318
I was gonna say Nicolas Cage.

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,604
That guy is in everything.

79
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:22,722
Let's just put on some music.

80
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:26,827
♪

81
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,662
I'll, uh, I'll bring out
the Gouda,

82
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:31,064
we'll open a couple bottles
of wine...

83
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,532
that are in the basement.

84
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:34,551
All right, I'll get
my beekeeper's suit.

85
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:36,203
You should be happy
about the bees.

86
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:37,737
They're keeping
the mice at bay.

87
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:38,738
We have mice?

88
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,257
Not with all these bees

89
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,508
flying around, we don't.

90
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,460
You're welcome.

91
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:46,963
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out. Look alive.

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,719
Are you a vegan?

93
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,137
What?

94
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,392
Kitchen, now.

95
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:01,645
I can't believe that he's
making us go to work tonight.

96
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:05,282
Are... you... a... vegan?

97
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,234
Um, no.

98
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:09,736
Uh-huh.
And when you were shoveling

99
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:12,656
the spring rolls down your
gullet, did you happen to notice

100
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,292
a little sign next
to the plate marked "Vegan"?

101
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,943
I think there's
been some mistake.

102
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:20,113
You could have had anything
on that table!

103
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:21,832
Anything at all!

104
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,385
Mini pizzas,
bacon-wrapped figs,

105
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:26,753
pigs in blankets.

106
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:28,638
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

107
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,258
But no, no, you had to have
the one thing

108
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,927
that someone with my dietary
preferences can eat.

109
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:35,929
Look, I didn't eat
the spring rolls.

110
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:37,764
Liar!

111
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:40,784
Your breath reeks of shredded
carrots and deceit!

112
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,474
Okay, okay, maybe I did eat
your precious spring rolls.

113
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:51,144
What are you gonna do
about it, <i>hippie?</i>

114
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:55,999
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

115
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,452
Young man,

116
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:01,538
are you suggesting
fisticuffs...

117
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,656
as in with our fists?

118
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:06,343
And feet--
I'm a kicker.

119
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:09,596
Well, well, looks like
I just started eating

120
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:11,465
white meat again.

121
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:15,969
I will bite and scratch
you like a wolverine.

122
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:18,004
May I warn you,

123
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:21,274
I have been in
a fight before.

124
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:23,527
So have I... sort of.

125
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,695
Oh, God.

126
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:28,815
Mr. Cootes. Hi.

127
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:31,518
Did you see that we had
hummus and veggies?

128
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,620
There's hummus and veggies?

129
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,854
Over there.

130
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:37,357
Hey, I'm not gonna let that guy
push me around.

131
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,744
I believe it was Sun Tzu
who wrote, "Never give up.

132
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:41,711
Never surrender."

133
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:43,246
Shut up, Ted.
Okay.

134
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:48,218
For God's sake, Lily,
you're pregnant.

135
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,222
For God's sake, Te
Lily's pregnant.

136
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:56,493
Oh, man.

137
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:58,211
Sorry about that.

138
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,063
I don't need
this right now, Ted.

139
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:01,982
I shouldn't do this.

140
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:03,216
- I shouldn't do this.
- What?

141
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:06,403
This is a bad idea.
This is a bad idea!

142
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:09,239
- What is?
- I should just go. I should just go!

143
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,942
Okay, okay, just tell me
what is going on.

144
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:14,528
I love my penis, Robin.

145
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,830
Oh, Barney, you promised.

146
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:19,332
I do! I love it!

147
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:21,535
If I could kiss it, I would.

148
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:24,254
I'd be lying if I told you
I hadn't tried.

149
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,423
I'm not comfortable
with this conversation.

150
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:30,243
Oh, come on, Robin, it's my
penis we're talking about.

151
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:32,462
- You've seen her-- she's magnificent.
- She?

152
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:35,432
Every penis is a girl, Robin.
Everyone knows that.

153
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:40,520
Like... ships and lake monsters.

154
00:06:40,522 --> 00:06:42,589
And Gouda!

155
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,274
She's a beauta.

156
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:45,525
Oh, Gouda.

157
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:47,760
Well, I'll be back.

158
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:49,762
Most of me, anyway.

159
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,232
- Don't eat that.
- What?

160
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,234
Whoops! Oh, it's ruined.

161
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:56,653
It's not ruined.
Ten second rule.

162
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:59,539
Eight, nine, ten,
and it's ruined.

163
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,458
This whole party's
ruined.

164
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,444
I got a basement
full of bees,

165
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,796
and Ted almost got into a fight
with Mr. Cootes.

166
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,465
Lily, look around.

167
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,116
Everyone's having
an amazing time.

168
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:11,318
It's a great party.

169
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,138
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

170
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,828
What the hell was that?!

171
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:31,030
<i>So that's what happened</i>
<i>in the living room.</i>

172
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,121
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you what</i>
<i>happened in the dining room.</i>

173
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,524
Oh, no, that's not
what you want.

174
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,429
Man, I can't believe
these are vegan.

175
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,663
I've had, like, 20 of 'em.

176
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,915
I should get the name
of this caterer.

177
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:49,385
It's my kitten's
Bat Mitzvah next week.

178
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,837
She's finally
becoming a cat.

179
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,872
Oh, God, you are crazy.

180
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,974
About cats.

181
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,544
Cats are so honest and real
with their affections.

182
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,763
Ever since my divorce,

183
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:02,564
it's just been one liar
after another.

184
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,884
That's why it's so refreshing
to meet someone honest like you,

185
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,720
Special Agent Gary Powers.

186
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,105
Listen...

187
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:13,776
I think we can agree
there's something here.

188
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:15,861
Something big...

189
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:19,865
that looks
and probably feels real.

190
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,251
Maybe...

191
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,952
we can go back
to your place.

192
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:26,905
I can't ask you to delay
intercepting those asteroids.

193
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,258
I do need to intercept
those asteroids.

194
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,126
I think we need
to have sex right now.

195
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,247
Meet me in the upstairs guest
bedroom in two minutes.

196
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,602
I'm just looking
for the vegan spring rolls.

197
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,970
Last one, sorry.

198
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:43,388
Two minutes.

199
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,808
How can they all be gone?
The party just started.

200
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,942
I know, right?

201
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,278
Let's just put on
some music.

202
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,596
♪

203
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,232
I'll, uh, I'll bring out
the Gouda,

204
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:55,433
we'll open a couple of bottles
of wine...

205
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,035
that are in the basement.

206
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,370
Some jerk was just here.

207
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,705
And he was all, like,

208
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,240
"I can't believe
these are vegan.

209
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,407
I've had, like, 20 of 'em."

210
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,627
Point me into the direction
of this scoundrel.

211
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,380
Um... it was
that guy.

212
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,233
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out. Look alive.

213
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:16,221
Lily, these spring rolls...
ooh-ee!

214
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,590
Kitchen, now.

215
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,727
I can't believe that he's
making us go to work tonight.

216
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,595
I mean, I think it's time
that somebody took him aside

217
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,764
and told him this is not
how you treat your staff.

218
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,017
Well, I'm sort of busy
with the party right now.

219
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,136
Fine. I'll do it myself.
But he's gonna scream at me,

220
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,821
and you know that I can't
stand up to screaming.

221
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,140
Just go talk to him!
I think I should go talk to him.

222
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,161
Barney...
Ah, Lily,

223
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:41,363
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

224
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,582
You could have had
anything on that table!

225
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:47,085
Mini pizzas,
bacon-wrapped figs,

226
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,120
pigs in blankets.

227
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:51,156
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

228
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,158
Robin. Okay, listen,
I need your help.

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,294
I'm about to get in
a screaming match with my boss,

230
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,828
and I'm not good at getting
screamed at,

231
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,347
so I need you to warm me up.

232
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,132
How?
I want you to scream at me.

233
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,351
You know, like you do
to strangers on the street

234
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,769
at the slightest provocation.

235
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,137
I don't do that.

236
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,772
Come on, lay some of that
classic Scherbatsky

237
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,273
mean son of a bitch on me.

238
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,809
Treat me like I'm a Girl Scout
trying to sell you cookies.

239
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,895
Four dollars a box
and you're out of Thin Mints?!

240
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:16,315
You green little...!
I don't do that!

241
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:17,816
Come on, scream at me.

242
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,068
Like that.

243
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,286
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

244
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,622
Marshall, there is plenty
of stuff

245
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,574
that I don't get mad about,

246
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,859
like the fact that you're
serving pigs in blankets

247
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,694
without hot mustard.

248
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,664
I'm not the type of person
to be driven crazy by a host

249
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,050
who refuses to provide
delicious hot mustard

250
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,969
in which to dip
my pigs in blankets!

251
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,037
I'm the type of girl who...
keeps her cool.

252
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,006
Who keeps her cool.

253
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,043
Wait. Whoa, baby,
are you okay?

254
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,212
Of course.
This party is great.

255
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,699
I am handling this.
Oh, God.

256
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,103
No...

257
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:56,355
Hummus and veggies?

258
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:59,074
I'm looking for
hummus and veggies.

259
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,743
Robin, can I talk to you about
something very dear to me?

260
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,612
Promise me this isn't
about your penis.

261
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:06,014
I promise it isn't
about my penis.

262
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,499
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:12,688
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

264
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,178
Sorry about that.

265
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,797
I don't need this
right now, Ted.

266
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,216
I swear, if there's
one more crisis...

267
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,101
Well, the bees
escaped their enclosure,

268
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,804
but no reason
to "bee" concerned.

269
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,691
No, there is,
we're in big trouble.

270
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,309
What is that smell?

271
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:36,594
Oh, I doused my suit
with kerosene.

272
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,263
All beekeepers do this.

273
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,482
Dad, just take off
the suit right now.

274
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:41,283
All right, fine.

275
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,101
Every 30 seconds,

276
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,287
there's another crisis
that needs to be dealt with

277
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,955
and I have
to deal with it.

278
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,708
This is... Oh, God.

279
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,326
This is parenthood, isn't it?

280
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,577
So they say.

281
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,162
Okay, it's official.

282
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:56,548
I thought I could do it,
but I can't.

283
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,083
No, Marshall's always at work.

284
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,551
He's got to go back tonight.

285
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,503
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

286
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,805
that's just one crisis
after another.

287
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,124
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

288
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,476
Gouda!

289
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,460
God.

290
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,312
Crisis?
Crisis.

291
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,815
- Don't eat that. Whoops!
- What?

292
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,150
Gouda's out, Ted.
Don't sleep on the Gouda.

293
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,351
Wouldn't dream of it.

294
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,136
So Lily told me you have to go
back to work tonight?

295
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,855
No, I don't have to go
back to work tonight.

296
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,273
Mr. Cootes and I
came to an understanding.

297
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,658
But, hey, what's going on
with Robin?

298
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,609
I called her
a mean son of a bitch

299
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,810
and she took it all weird.

300
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,446
- She did?
- Yeah.

301
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,630
Crazy, right?

302
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,365
Hey, buddy.

303
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,034
Best housewarming
party ever.

304
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,486
Everybody's abuzz.

305
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,987
Abuzz.

306
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,539
Oh, good one, Mickey.

307
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,840
But, hey, you're right.

308
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,635
Great party.

309
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,886
What the hell
was that?!

310
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,449
<i>And that's what happened</i>
<i>in the dining room.</i>

311
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:01,194
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>what happened in the kitchen.</i>

312
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:05,193
Oh, no, that's not
what you want.

313
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,629
Man, I can't believe
these are vegan.

314
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:08,830
Back to our fight?

315
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:10,281
Back to our fight.

316
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:12,600
I cannot believe you screamed
at that woman at Zabar's.

317
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:13,968
She was trying to cut in line.

318
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,453
She was gonna get
the last kugel.

319
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:16,671
She was 90 years old.

320
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:18,807
It was probably gonna be
her last kugel.

321
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:20,642
Sometimes in life,
you have to be assertive

322
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:21,959
and stand up for yourself.

323
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:23,294
You called her a whore.

324
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:24,762
Who wears that much makeup?!

325
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:25,730
Old ladies!

326
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:27,849
Who take money for sex. Exactly.

327
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,235
Look, I'm sorry.

328
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,970
If I would've left things
in your dainty, lily-white,

329
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,856
never-ripped-
an-old-lady's-wig-off hands,

330
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:36,908
we would be kugel-free
right now.

331
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,576
Oh, so, what, I'm too nice?

332
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:40,161
You never stand up for yourself.

333
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:42,614
Remember that sixth grader
who kept stealing your lunch?

334
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:45,450
High school was
a tough time for me, okay?

335
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,035
And that girl was muscular.

336
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:48,703
Forearms like Popeye.

337
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,338
How do you even know about that?

338
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,624
Marshall told me.
He also said that

339
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,042
you had your mom stop making

340
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:55,593
peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

341
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:57,328
because of that girl's
nut allergy.

342
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,047
I didn't want to add
to her health problems.

343
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:00,348
She was already in a wheelchair.

344
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,999
Okay, so what?

345
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:04,835
I would rather be nice
than be like you,

346
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:06,521
always getting in fights
about stuff

347
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:07,972
that's not even worth
fighting about.

348
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,173
Disagree.

349
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:11,693
It's like Sun Tzu wrote
in <i>The Art of War,</i>

350
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:13,728
"Never give up.
Never surrender."

351
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,530
That was Tim Allen
in <i>Galaxy Quest.</i>

352
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:16,681
Whatever, dude.

353
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,700
Your problem is any time
you're faced with

354
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:20,735
the least bit of confrontation,
you run away.

355
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,304
Oh, I run away
from confrontation?

356
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,494
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out.

357
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:30,845
Look alive.

358
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:33,882
Whoops.
Son of a...!

359
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,533
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:37,252
Maybe that was my fault.

361
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:38,419
You think?

362
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:39,804
You're right in my snack track.

363
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:42,257
Hey, nice
beekeeper suit.

364
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,376
Do you know that, uh,
most bees are left-handed?

365
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:47,845
Did you know bees hate
the smell of kerosene?

366
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:49,514
I knew that.
Geez, what do you think,

367
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:51,432
this is my first day
as a beekeeper?

368
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,102
Nice. Oh.

369
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:56,771
Is that true about
bees and kerosene?

370
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,389
I don't know.

371
00:14:58,391 --> 00:14:59,774
Barney...

372
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:00,775
Ah, Lily,

373
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,944
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

374
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,779
Barney, that woman
you were talking to,

375
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:05,747
our neighbor Geraldine,

376
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:07,348
some guy
slept with her

377
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,451
and didn't call her,
so she hunted him down

378
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:15,256
and cut off a certain part of
his anatomy with a cheese knife.

379
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,709
So, whatever you do,

380
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:19,210
don't sleep with her.

381
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:23,047
It's funny, she is,
um, waiting for me

382
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:24,849
in the guest bedroom right now.

383
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:26,751
Oh, God! Oh, God!

384
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:29,270
That was the idea,
but now forget it!

385
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:30,555
Barney, this is a disaster.

386
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,941
I swear, if there
is one...

387
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,092
It's fine. Everything's fine.

388
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:36,611
Hey, ten second
rule, right?

389
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:41,065
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

390
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,568
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

391
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,120
I know you're pregnant, but
you need a glass of wine.

392
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:47,938
I got that cheese off
the Internet.

393
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,374
I know you got it
off the Internet.

394
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:50,708
Why does that
make it impressive?

395
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,794
You know what else you can find
on the Internet?

396
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:54,495
Zoo animals masturbating.

397
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,297
There's one of a walrus.

398
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,448
He's...

399
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,634
Oh.

400
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,681
No...

401
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,703
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

402
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,282
Mr. Cootes, I am not
going back to work tonight.

403
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,168
Oh, no, she didn't
just say that.

404
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:35,753
Mickey, could we just
have a minute?

405
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:38,173
Oh, yeah. Sure.

406
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:43,394
Marshall, look, I know
when you started with this firm,

407
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,096
it was all fun and games.

408
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:48,900
The office chair races
were particularly spirited.

409
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:52,237
Until, of course,
Gail went down the stairs.

410
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,905
But for one brief moment,

411
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:56,441
boy, did she fly.

412
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:00,528
I'm not here, I'm not here.

413
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,864
Mr. Cootes, you're working
yourself to death.

414
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:05,316
Just cut loose a little.

415
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:07,785
Have a beer, find a hobby.

416
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:09,671
Look, son, it's very simple.

417
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:12,490
Um, Mother Earth
doesn't get a night off.

418
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:13,708
Neither do you.

419
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,093
Well, then I quit.

420
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:21,432
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

421
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:23,351
that's just one crisis
after another.

422
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:25,637
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

423
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:26,971
Gouda!

424
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:27,939
Maybe he's right.

425
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:30,225
Maybe I do
need a hobby.

426
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,860
Well, hey,
how about beekeeping?

427
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:34,946
Me? No. I-I don't know the
first thing about bees.

428
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:37,232
You want to know a secret?

429
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:38,600
Neither do I.

430
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:40,952
It's not a secret.

431
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:42,987
Let me try this thing on.

432
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:44,372
I'm gonna give you
some privacy.

433
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:46,207
All right, thank you.

434
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,458
Okay.

435
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,910
Hey, buddy.

436
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:50,745
Best housewarming
party ever.

437
00:17:50,747 --> 00:17:52,463
Everybody's abuzz.

438
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:57,552
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

439
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:58,720
Great party.

440
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,984
Oh, my God. Oh!

441
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:14,235
Oh, Mr. Cootes!

442
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:15,603
Mr. Cootes, are you okay?!

443
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:18,990
That was amazing!

444
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,191
Did you see me?!

445
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:22,577
I flew through the air
like a human fireball

446
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:23,861
and didn't get a scratch.

447
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,413
Eat your heart out, Gail!

448
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,899
God, I feel so alive!

449
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,501
I want to drink a beer.

450
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:31,619
Oh, yeah.

451
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,171
Okay, one beer, coming right up.

452
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,924
Oh, and, uh, Marshall,

453
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:39,577
I think we'll take
the night off tonight, okay?

454
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,346
Sounds good, yeah.

455
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,464
But I'll see you Monday?

456
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,717
Of course.

457
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,718
Yeah.

458
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:52,056
You know, Robin, I've
been thinking about it.

459
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:54,692
Guess it's kind of nice
you're such a badass.

460
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:58,363
It's pretty badass
you're so nice, Ted.

461
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:04,643
Was I supposed to close
the basement door?

462
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:10,656
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

463
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,573
God, this feels
so right!

464
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,991
We're so great together.

465
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,460
I want to spend every minute
of every day with you.

466
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,329
I never let you out of
my sight for one second.

467
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,997
Not one second, not
one second. I don't!

468
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,299
Oh, God!

469
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,500
My last lover was not like this.

470
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,002
He was the worst!

471
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,138
Do you know, he didn't even
come to my cat's bris.

472
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,757
I mean, what?

473
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,125
Well, we showed him.

474
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,343
Yes, we did.

475
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,462
Let's just say, the
punishment fit the crime.

476
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:43,930
I can't wait to
tell everybody

477
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,482
that we're boyfriend and girlfriend!

478
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,633
Let's do it tonight.

479
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:47,985
No, it's Lily and
Marshall's party.

480
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,302
We'll wait.

481
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:52,439
We can do it at Mittens
and Mr. Pepper's wedding.

482
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,973
Or maybe something...
