Help!
Hang on, kid.

8
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,374
Grab my tie.

9
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,609
But you're not supposed
to take the tie off.

10
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,112
You lost a bet with your
friends Lily and Marshall

11
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,714
which requires you to wear
the tie for a full year.

12
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:02,318
If it means saving your life,
I think they'll understand!

13
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,887
They sound like nice people!

14
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:04,921
Yeah, they are.

15
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,923

18
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,167
Thanks, Mister.

19
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:19,682
How can I repay you?

20
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,505
You can stay in school,
that's how.

21
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,776
No!

22
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:27,810
True story.

the heck out of
that ducky tie. I really am.

25
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,351

00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,553

"Absolutely No
Boogie-Boarding"?

33
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:07,370
What's that all about?

34
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,873
Oh, that's a great story.
You got time for it?

35
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:13,810
Well, I'm supposed to go to
my mom's birthday party, so...

36
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,012
please make it as
long as you can.

37
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:18,081
Well, it happened
a few months ago.

38
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,883
The night of the hurricane...

39
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:22,252
<i>Kids, it was August 26, 2011,</i>

40
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,922
<i>and Hurricane Irene was
barreling towards New York.</i>

41
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,790
Guys, guys, guys.

42
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,492
This storm is serious.

43
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,761
Luckily, you are friends
with a former Boy Scout.

44
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,196
And a Boy Scout is always what?

45
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:34,464
Unpopular?
Beaten up?

46
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:35,765
Going to the movies
with his mom?

47
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,633
A Boy Scout is always prepared.

48
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:39,469
Prepared to spend lunch
in his locker?

49
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,703
Prepared to die a virgin?

50
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,105
Prepared to paint
his sister's nails?

51
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,007
Prepared for emergencies!

52
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:45,441
That's why a week ago,

53
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,244
when Irene was just
a tropical depression-

54
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,112
You're a tropical depression.

55
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:50,947
This guy got us...

56
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:52,749
a disaster backpack,

57
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,551
and a rental car that seats
five, parked right outside.

58
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:57,320
We're gonna drive up
to my place in Westchester

59
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,488
where we'll all be safe.

60
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,290
Boy Scouted!
You're welcome.

61
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,624
Ted's right, we should go.

62
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,126
Hey, on the way out of the city,

63
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:05,628
do you mind if we stop at my
place so I can get something?

64
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,499
Okay, what did you have to get?

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,535
My drink on.
We're not going anywhere.

66
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:14,004
What? No!

67
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,172
We don't have time for this!
We gotta get going!

68
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:18,141
Ted, I'm older than you.
Yeah.

69
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:19,409
And taller.
Just older.

70
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,278
And when you reach my age,
and height,

71
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,613
you'll see that things like this
hurricane are no big deal.

72
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:25,215
They're going to close
the bridges.

73
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,417
You guys, we got
to get out of here.

74
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:29,452
I'm afraid I'm with
blondie on this one.

75
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,388
This storm is nothing.
I'm from Vancouver.

76
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,256
You know what we call
this in the Couv?

77
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:34,791
Barbecue weather.

78
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,960
Yeah, I'm with these guys.

79
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:39,396
Drinking beer in front
of Barney's giant TV

80
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,863
beats sitting in the car

81
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:42,165
<i>listening to
Memoires of a Geisha.</i>

82
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,600
Come on, we're at the best part.

83
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:47,971
Oh, it's my mom,
checking to see if I'm okay.

84
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:49,372
Hey, Mom.

85
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,808
Ooh, Mommy!
It's dwizzling out!

86
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,609
I'm so scared!

87
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,844
Bikini weather.

88
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,813
Marshall, you're with me, right?

89
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:59,482
Sorry, old friend.

90
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:02,385
But I can't afford
to tempt fate.

91
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:05,721
Oh right, I was being
really weird.

92
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,157
I should explain.

93
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,724
Last summer I quit my job.

94
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,526
And then, a week before
the hurricane...

95
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:14,965
Huh, my medical
insurance just expired.

96
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:18,634
That gives me two uninsured weeks
before I'm added to your plan.

97
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:20,236
It's no biggie.

98
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:22,572
Ow!
Paper cut.

99
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:28,578
Death is all around us.

100
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:30,613
So for the next two weeks

101
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:33,749
he was basically a really
clingy Edgar Allan Poe.

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,853
The Grim Reaper beckons.

103
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:41,591
I feel his icy grip
around my throat,

104
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:44,094
the breath of his hounds
at my heels,

105
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:50,700
the unrelenting rat-tat-tat of
his scythe on my chamber door.

106
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:53,836
And you, with your
blithe request,

107
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:56,206
you only hasten
his inevitable triumph.

108
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,375
Is that what you desire?

109
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,543
Is that what you desire, Lily?

110
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,346
I just wanted you
to get us some bagels.

111
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:05,315
Bagels?!

112
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:08,684
Do you have any idea

113
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:12,088
what could happen to me
whilst getting bagels?!

114
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:21,697
What the...?!
No, not like this!

115
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,566
Fine. I'll go get the bagels.

116
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,800
No!

117
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,202
Why not?

118
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,238
And remember, not too
much cream cheese.

119
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,206
Half a shmear, max.

120
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:33,043
Thanks, baby.

121
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,747
No! No! Not like this!

122
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:40,216
Okay, now you're just
being ridiculous.

123
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,085
Well, life is ridiculous, Lily!

124
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:44,620
People get run over by buses

125
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,657
and hit in the nuts by
skateboards, bitten by babies.

126
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:49,959
Nobody wakes up and says,
"Today I'm gonna star

127
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,261
in a YouTube video."

128
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:53,396
You've said that at
least a dozen times.

129
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:56,332
Lily, for the next two weeks

130
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,735
you must be by my side
protecting me.

131
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:01,771
Why, what's gonna happen?

132
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:04,941
Answer: a hurricane.

133
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:06,976
Just let me take off the tie!
Please!

134
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,978
I have to wear this at work.

135
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,314
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

136
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:15,285
If the SEC pursues charges,
it's going to be all our asses.

137
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:19,589
Nobody takes this
more seriously than I do.

138
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,492
Please, can I take it off?

139
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:27,363
You... may... knot.

140
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:29,099
With a "K."

141
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,833
A little tie pun.

142
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,602
This is far from over.

143
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:36,406
You have a price, Eriksen,
and I will find it.

144
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:41,711
When the end of day is nigh,
I'll have taken off this tie.

145
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:45,548
I'm going to like the way
I look, I guarantee it.

146
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,618
So boogie-boarding...

147
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,886
Boogie-boarding. So I was trying
to get these guys to leave.

148
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:52,888
Hey, Nerdlinger,

149
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,524
what's with the safety boner?

150
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:55,958
I mean, come on.

151
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,129
The disaster kit, the car,
the ladies' rain boots-

152
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,896
Uh, they're men's.

153
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:03,666
Pink is just easier to
spot from the rescue chopper.

154
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,035
Look, forgive me for caring
about you guys,

155
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,703
but you're my best friends
in the world

156
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,572
and I just want to make sure
you're okay.

157
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:14,844
Ah. Ted, you are
a giant whining bummer.

158
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:15,811
Barney...

159
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:16,912
Come on, Ted,

160
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:20,216
this storm is not a big deal.

161
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:22,385
This storm is a big deal.

162
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:23,853
Let's replay
that harrowing footage

163
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:25,655
of Irene touching
down in North Carolina.

164
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,895
We gotta get out of here!

165
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,031
Go, go! Come on,
come on!

166
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:38,870
Please let me take it off!
No.

167
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,478
$5,000?
No.

168
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:41,285
Is he serious?

169
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,419
$10,000?

170
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,787
No.
Dudes, take the money.

171
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:45,189
$20,000?
No.

172
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,157
Yes. I'll let you slap me in the face

173
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,059
as hard as you can.
You have my attention.

174
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,561
<i>Kids, you remember Marshall
and Barney's slap bet.</i>

175
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,464
<i>A few years earlier,
Barney lost a bet to Marshall.</i>

176
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:58,202
<i>His penalty was five slaps
delivered anyplace, anytime.</i>

177
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:01,471
<i>So far, Marshall had slapped
Barney four times.</i>

178
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,507
<i>Which meant he only had
one slap left.</i>

179
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,542
What do you say, Marshall?

180
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:08,345
Are you going to seize
this slap-ortunity

181
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,247
or let it slap
through your fingers?

182
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,149
Don't let him
tempt you, Marshall.

183
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,019
I don't know, Lily. I mean
we have a baby on the way.

184
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,654
An extra slap could
really come in handy.

185
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,956
No! No!

186
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,058
This is crazy.

187
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,295
You having to wear that tie
for another ten months

188
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,163
is all the satisfaction I need.

189
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,398
Plus,

190
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,199
I still have one slap left,

191
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,602
and that feels good. But if
you didn't have that slap left-

192
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:36,373
if say, I were to get you
to slap me tonight-

193
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:39,276
I suppose that
would change everything.

194
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:42,846
I suppose it would.

195
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:48,052
<i>Le jeu commence.</i>

196
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:53,023
<i>Je m'appelle Marshall.</i>

197
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,827
So boogie-boarding...
Boogie-boarding.

198
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,628
So I was trying to get
these guys to leave,

199
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,030
but there was
one little problem.

200
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,298
Come on, let's go.

201
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,399
I'm staying.

202
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,201
What?!
Barney?!

203
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:06,070
Hey, hey, it's going to get
pretty crazy out there.

204
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,138
And if some hot woman gets
all her clothes blown off,

205
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,639
and I'm not up here
to videotape it

206
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,508
and put it up on the Internet,
who will, FEMA?

207
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,843
Come on, open your eyes.

208
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,544
No, no, you are coming with us.

209
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,781
We leave no man behind.

210
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:19,383
Hey, Mom.

211
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,986
Uh, yeah, the boots
were a big hit.

212
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:24,989
You know, I better pee.

213
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,157
But when Lily and I get back,
we're all leaving.

214
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,859
Wait, I have to go
pee with you?

215
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,362
You want me to go
to the "bathroom,"

216
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,798
the most dangerous room
in the house by myself?

217
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,933
Do you have any idea
what could happen?

218
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:40,871
Ow! My eye!

219
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm blind!

220
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:48,678
No, no!
Not like this!

221
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,614
I don't think
we're seeing eye to eye

222
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,682
about the likelihood
of that happening.

223
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:55,019
Hey, it's my dad.

224
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,388
My dad's calling me.

225
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,723
Hey, do you know where...?
Ted got his boots?

226
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,458
Yeah. They're fabulous.
I totally want a pair.

227
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,228
Okay, Dad, I will. Thanks.

228
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,431
Guys, Dad says this hurricane is
a bigger deal than you thought.

229
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm taking charge.
We are getting out of here.

230
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:12,536
Okay, what is with
everybody's parents calling

231
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:14,038
to check up on them?

232
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,173
It's just a little rain.

233
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,741
Lawn-mowing weather.

234
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,876
Bocce weather.

235
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,211
Wow. You're really bummed

236
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:22,646
that your dad's
not worried about you.

237
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:23,813
What?!

238
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,783
Eh... What would my
dad be worried about?

239
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:29,853
That I'm not wearing
enough sunblock?

240
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,122
House-painting weather.

241
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,391
Ted, you're back.

242
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,160
I've changed my mind.
I'm in. Let's go.

243
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:37,894
Yeah, I changed my mind, too.
You can't come.

244
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,296
Everybody else,
we're moving out.

245
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,631
That's harsh.

246
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,934
You know what else is harsh?
Ultraviolet light.

247
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,835
I fell asleep in the tanning bed
this week

248
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:48,072
and I think I got a sunburn
on my cheek.

249
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:50,507
It's so sensitive.

250
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,177
It's like a big, red bull's-eye.

251
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:54,478
Ouchie.

252
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,880
Did you take my blush
out of my purse?

253
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,683
So, boogie-boarding.

254
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:01,151
Boogie-boarding.

255
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:02,586
Oh, come on, Ted,

256
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:03,920
you can't just leave him here.

257
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,189
Uh, yeah, I can.

258
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,391
You called me a giant
whining bummer.

259
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,858
You're not allowed in my car.

260
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:11,462
You don't get to find out
if the geisha finds love.

261
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,696
This is about principle.

262
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,568
Hey, Ted.
I'm ready to go.

263
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,503
And you must be "Principle."

264
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:22,339
Ah, on a separate note,
guys, this is Maya.

265
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,873
I just met her out in the hall.

266
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,175
We have a lot in common,

267
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:26,910
such as our mutual love
of country music,

268
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,579
NASCAR and Jeff Foxworthy.
Just go with it.

269
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,347
She needed a ride
out of the city,

270
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,416
and we have an extra seat
in the car, so...

271
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,817
Okay, let's hit it!

272
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,185
Wow.

273
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,753
It's come to this.

274
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:38,222
You could help a friend,

275
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:40,190
but instead, you're choosing
the hot girl in

276
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,492
the tight tank top.

277
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,495
Your training is complete!

278
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,730
I'm so proud of this kid!

279
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,266
But seriously,
the storm's coming in,

280
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,734
so dump the hoochie
and wheels up.

281
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,236
You promised me a seat.

282
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,237
Oh, for God's sake.

283
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:54,804
You two both go.
I'll stay here.

284
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,473
What? Lily, no!
Shotgun!

285
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,908
You're staying. Then
Lily can come! Wha...?

286
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,611
No, no, no, I'll stay here.
Why?

287
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:03,614
I just want
some time away from you!

288
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,083
What?

289
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,253
Marshall, I'm sorry. I love you,

290
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:12,556
but I haven't had a second alone
in weeks!

291
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,224
It's summer vacation!

292
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,760
All I want to do is
sit in the bathtub

293
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,995
and read a book, but now...

294
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:22,199
Baby, I forgot to bring a book.

295
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,069
Do you mind reading
yours out loud?

296
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,572
Hey, it's been no picnic
for me either.

297
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,073
You don't even do the voices.

298
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:34,378
Blocked number.

299
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,179
Hello?

300
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,515
RJ? It's your father.

301
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,917
Daddy?

302
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:42,986
I love you.

303
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:44,521
It means so much
that you called.

304
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:47,691
Ha! I knew that you
wanted him to call. Busted!

305
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,494
That was you?

306
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,095
I really think
you should slap him.

307
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:53,096
You should slap him!

308
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:53,797
Slap him.
Slap him.

309
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,765
Two cheeks, no waiting.

310
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:58,635
Good, 'cause I really
think I'm gonna slap him!

311
00:12:58,636 --> 00:12:59,469
So, boog -boarding?

312
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,204
Boogie-boarding.

313
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:01,638
Come on, Ted.

314
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,807
You're gonna give some
random floozy a ride,

315
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:04,974
but not take Barney?

316
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,510
Floozy?!

317
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,844
If she's going, I'm not going!

318
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,279
Lily, you're staying.
Let's go.

319
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,681
If Lily's staying,
then I'm staying!

320
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:12,048
Then I'm going.
Then I'm going.

321
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:14,184
You can't go, Marshall,
'cause I'm going.

322
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:16,520
If Barney's going, I'm
not going! Then I can go.

323
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,854
Then I'm staying.
Then I'm staying.

324
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:18,855
Then I'm going.

325
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:19,956
Then I'm not going.

326
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:22,192
Okay, you know what?
I'm going.

327
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,228
This storm's been on Doppler
radar for a week.

328
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,129
I'm the only one
who prepared for it.

329
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,265
And you all made fun of me.
So guess what?

330
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,267
This Boy Scout
is taking a hike. Good-bye!

331
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:36,406
Maya, real quick, did you think
there was anything here, or...

332
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:37,407
Oh, I have a boyfriend.

333
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:38,542
Good-bye!

334
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:41,378
Um, Ted...?

335
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,813
The time for evacuation is over.

336
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:46,049
Everyone should now go inside
and be prepared

337
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,253
to stay inside until weather
conditions improve,

338
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,856
which won't likely be
until Sunday afternoon.

339
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,259
We're stuck here?

340
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,193
Okay, let's not panic.

341
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:04,301
You know what?
Let's panic.

342
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:14,364
Hey, if we don't make it
through the night,

343
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:17,759
I want you guys to know,
and I really mean this...

344
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,005
I wish I had branched out
and made more friends in my 20s.

345
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:24,245
Well,

346
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:27,163
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

347
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:30,881
By myself, I guess.

348
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:33,117
Watch out for bears.

349
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:41,325
Since this might be the end,
I gotta confess something.

350
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,326
Can I?

351
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:43,894
Might as well.

352
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:48,332
Barney and I have been doing
the wild thing...

353
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,934
this whole time.

354
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,804
Except a brief period last year
when he was shacking up

355
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,573
with Marshall's mom.

356
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:59,176
But luckily, three-ways
were on the menu, so...

357
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:02,113
Marshall, you know she didn't
say any of that, right?

358
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:05,616
I know, but I just want
to slap him so bad!

359
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:08,919
But that tie is so stupid!
But the slap would feel so good!

360
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,854
But he hates that tie so much!

361
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,090
Perhaps I can help.

362
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:16,893
Marshall, ask yourself this
question: why today?

363
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:21,432
He hasn't said anything about
that tie for weeks,

364
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,033
and yet, suddenly today,

365
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:24,935
he can't wear it another second?

366
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,704
No, there's a reason.

367
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,373
You've got something coming up.

368
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:31,475
Something where you're

369
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:34,845
on display, vulnerable...

370
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:35,912
exposed.

371
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,183
It's not work-related.

372
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:41,619
No, this is relationship stuff.

373
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,388
You're trying
to impress someone.

374
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:45,756
In the lie you told,

375
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:47,724
you said you were being chased
by two goons.

376
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,092
So it's two people.

377
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,628
A couple, perhaps.

378
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,366
You're meeting
Nora's parents tomorrow!

379
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,834
Wrong!

380
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:59,936
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong!

381
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:03,240
It's in two days, and I really
want them to like me!

382
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,176
Oh-ho!
Therapisted!

383
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,810
Shrinked? Shrunk?

384
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:08,011
We'll figure it out.

385
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:09,680
So, boogie-boarding.

386
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:10,981
Boogie-boarding.

387
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:14,818
Hey, Lily, can I talk
to you for just a second?

388
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:17,454
Come here.

389
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,791
Marshall, if I'm in here to
brush your teeth, I swear to...

390
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,495
I'm sorry
that I've been so needy lately.

391
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,730
I know that you need
some time alone.

392
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:29,600
So... I'll be in
the other room.

393
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:32,703
You're not going anywhere.

394
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,208
Mmm...
Hey...

395
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:41,412
And the funny thing is,

396
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,481
after that night,
we'll never be alone again.

397
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:46,617
You made that in my bathroom?

398
00:16:46,618 --> 00:16:49,019
Whoops.

399
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,822
Wow, a hurricane baby.

400
00:16:51,823 --> 00:16:54,658
Oh, man, Hurricane Eriksen would
be a sweet name.

401
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,594
It would be a crazy sweet name!

402
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,629
Thanks, Ted.

403
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,532
Anyway, the next day,
after the danger had passed...

404
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,900
It's closed.

405
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:04,901
Now what?

406
00:17:04,902 --> 00:17:07,904
A Boy Scout is always prepared.

407
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:09,906
Hey!

408
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,409
Nice!

409
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,677
To surviving the hurricane.

410
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:14,678
Yay!

411
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,715
I love you guys.
Love you.

412
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:20,451
<i>I did finally make it up here
to the house later that week</i>

413
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:22,586
<i>only to find that
a falling oak tree had</i>

414
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,154
<i>landed in the living room.</i>

415
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:27,090
<i>If we'd been here, it would
have crushed us like bugs.</i>

416
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,426
<i>You see, kids, there's no way
of knowing for sure</i>

417
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,927
<i>where the safest place is...</i>

418
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:34,431
<i>so the best you can hope for is
to have some good company.</i>

419
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:36,767
Guys, how far do you think I can
boogie-board on this thing?

420
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,201
So far!

421
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:41,171
Marshall, your insurance doesn't
kick in till tomorrow.

422
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:43,407
Yeah, well, you know what?

423
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:44,975
Life kicks in right now.

424
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,915
♪ ♪

425
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,353
Don't worry, he wasn't hurt...

426
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:58,155
<i>the first time.
I have splints!</i>

427
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:00,491
<i>The second time he went through
the front window of Maclaren's.</i>

428
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:02,793
Hence the
"No Boogie-boarding" sign.

429
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:04,928
All right, guys, I gotta go.

430
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,665
Barney, good luck
with Nora's parents.

431
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,666
Bye.
Bye.

432
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,667
See you later.

433
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,635
All right. See you.
See ya.

434
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,970
Hey, Barney?

435
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:14,871
Hmm?

436
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:16,907
Listen, um, we made a baby

437
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,509
in your bathroom.

438
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,010
So we owe you one.

439
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,246
So we say...

440
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,382
you can take off the ducky tie.

441
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,787
For three slaps.

442
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,655
Three slaps?

443
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:34,491
And to be clear,
this would add three slaps

444
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:38,161
to Marshall's existing one,
giving him four slaps in total.

445
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:38,995
Deal.

446
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,266
I'm free!

447
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:47,170
God, this feels so good!

448
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:49,873
This was a mistake!

449
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,241
I wanna put the tie back on!

450
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:52,476
I wanna put the tie back on!

451
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:54,044
Why do I have to be
Barney right now?

452
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,715
Three slaps remaining!

453
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:00,016
Three slaps. Wow,
I like the sound of that.

454
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:01,819
I think I'll save
those bad boys,

455
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,286
you know, for a rainy day.

456
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:04,888
Okay.
The worst is over.

457
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:07,991
Ah!

458
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,527
Two slaps remaining!

459
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:13,397
It's all right.

460
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:15,332
Hey, it's all done...

461
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,633
for now.

462
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,435
I think I need to go home

463
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,637
and reevaluate how
I make life decisions.

464
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,939
Come on. I have
to go back to work.

465
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,008
Let's split a cab. Okay. Yeah.

466
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:35,819
Did you ever tell those guys
about that other thing

467
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,220
that almost happened?

468
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:41,191
That other thing?

469
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,926
Oh, that. No. Did you?

470
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:44,194
No.

471
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,330
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that phone call.

472
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:48,399
Oh, it's fine.

473
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,834
No, it is so not fine.
I was a jerk.

474
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:52,836
And if you don't mind my
saying, your dad is

475
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:55,873
a complete idiot
for not calling.

476
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:58,542
He should never let a day go by
without calling you

477
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:02,613
because when I let a day go by
without talking to you...

478
00:20:02,614 --> 00:20:08,419
Um, that day's just no good.

479
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:15,125
Um, sorry.

480
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:16,427
Um...

481
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:19,129
It's my dad.

482
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,263
Wait, show me your hands.

483
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:21,298
My hands.

484
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,200
Hey, Dad!

485
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:26,937
That's what I've been saying!

486
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:28,806
Golf weather!

487
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:30,507
Can you believe we almost...?

488
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,075
I know.

489
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:33,143
Good thing we didn't.

490
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:35,245
Yeah. I mean, not
long after that

491
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:36,613
you got together with Nora.

492
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:37,781
And you met Kevin.

493
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:38,882
Yeah.
Disaster averted.

494
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,183
Exactly.

495
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:42,252
It would've ruined everything
if we'd been all...

496
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:43,226
ah-la-la-la...

497
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:45,355
I know, right?
So dumb...

498
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,816
La-la-la-la-la-la...
