00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:04,258
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, in October 2011,</i>
<i>your Aunt Robin was in therapy.</i>

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,792
<i>And against all logic,</i>
<i>it was actually going well.</i>

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:08,515
But why?

4
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:11,318
Why-why am I constantly looking
for reasons not to be happy?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,405
Maybe because the idea of
finally being happy...

6
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:16,106
terrifies you.

7
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:19,293
Bro, you are killing it today.

8
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,944
Pshh!

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,497
We got something good here.

10
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:25,949
We are totes gonna conquer
my fear of abandonment!

11
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:27,384
I can't see you anymore.

12
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:29,553
(laughs) Nice.

13
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:31,588
"Oh, no! You're
abandoning me!"

14
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:34,624
Oh, no. You're abandoning me?

15
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:37,561
I'm sorry.
I'm moving to Alaska.

16
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:41,015
NARRATOR: <i>And that might have</i>
<i>been the end of it.</i>

17
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:42,266
<i>But a week later...</i>

18
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:44,318
Kevin?!

19
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:46,487
What are you doing here?

20
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,774
Okay, look, I lied to you
about moving to Alaska.

21
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:52,943
I-I had to stop seeing you.

22
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:54,228
Why?

23
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,547
'Cause I think you're cute.

24
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:58,382
And ethically,
I can't be your therapist

25
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:00,217
if I'm attracted to you.

26
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,819
Oh, I get it. You dump me
as a patient

27
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,505
just so you can ask me out?

28
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:05,639
I'm not gonna ask you out.

29
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:06,974
You're not?

30
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:09,810
No. We met in therapy.

31
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:12,579
It's inappropriate for me
to date a patient.

32
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,699
Anyway, it was nice seeing you.

33
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:19,503
Hey, wait.

34
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:21,004
How do you define "date"?

35
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:24,141
Two people having a meal
together,

36
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:25,192
sitting across the table

37
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:26,643
making googly eyes
at each other...

38
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:30,981
What about two people eating
alone, sitting side by side,

39
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:34,184
making googly eyes
at the coffee maker?

40
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,704
Okay, it's not a date.

41
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:38,122
Exactly. Not a date.

42
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,991
NARRATOR: And <i>so Robin and Kevin had</i>
<i>breakfast alone,</i>

43
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:45,412
<i>side by side</i>
<i>every day that week.</i>

44
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:48,382
<i>Until finally...</i>

45
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:54,705
Oh, hey!

46
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:56,507
Sorry. No cabs.

47
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,208
Ran 40 blocks
all the way here.

48
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,560
May have knocked an old lady

49
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:01,211
into the street,
don't know, I didn't look back.

50
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:02,262
Let's just go on a real date.

51
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:03,931
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

52
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,399

Is it good?

58
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:24,772
Awesome. Wait, totally
hypothetically,

59
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:27,224
do you like movies with a

Yes.

You will love this movie.

Hey, guys.

00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:33,948
Hey, Marshall.
What's up?

65
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,616
Well, I'll tell you what's up.

66
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:37,802
You know how my boss,
Garrison Cootes, is,

67
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,737
like, the most famous
environmental lawyer

68
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:40,554
in the world?

69
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,206
ALL:
Yeah...

70
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,576
I mean, it's him
or the other guy.

71
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:46,911
Sir Anthony Howel?

72
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,297
ALL:
Yeah...

73
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,415
Anyway, he's an important guy,
okay?

74
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,984
And so today at work,

75
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:55,136
I was trying to show him
that I'm tough.

76
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:56,971
I've been thinking
about this

77
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,222
settlement offer we're about

78
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:00,308
to get from Gruber
Pharmaceuticals.

79
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,226
If it's anything less
than $20 million,

80
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:03,293
then I'm gonna grab

81
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:06,063
those corporate Earth rapists
by their...

82
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:08,065
Okay, I'm just gonna
say something.

83
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,984
I'm growing a child
in my belly,

84
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,902
a child that just
developed ears.

85
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:14,572
This is a very
thin sweater.

86
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,324
So please, if you must
tell your story...

87
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,942
just make it
cheerful.

88
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:19,560
Cheerful.

89
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,696
Okay...

90
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,414
Then I'm gonna grab those
corporate...

91
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,849
employees...

92
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,817
by their sweaty, dangling...

93
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,835
hands...

94
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:30,487
and squeeze until those greedy
sons of...

95
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,790
parents... realize that
I'm the baddest mother...

96
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,676
nature lover around.

97
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:38,512
It's like watching
<i>The Breakfast Club</i> on TBS.

98
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:40,431
So what did he say?

99
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:45,102
Marshall, bend down so I
can put my arm around you.

100
00:03:45,104 --> 00:03:47,221
That's all the way down.
That's good.

101
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:49,190
Gruber Pharmaceuticals
is a company full

102
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:51,142
of well-meaning people
doing their jobs,

103
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:53,227
just like you and me.

104
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,980
Guys, I'm afraid that Garrison
Cootes has gone soft!

105
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,982
He's like a teddy bear!

106
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,568
A teddy bear
or an Ewok?

107
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,737
You know, cute and cuddly
around the village,

108
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,655
but once the battle starts...

109
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:08,042
He'll smash in your metal skull
with giant swinging logs.

110
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,160
Marshall!

111
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,411
Okay, he'll hug you

112
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:12,830
until you agree to peaceably
shut down the Death Star.

113
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:14,031
NORA:
Hi, sweetie.

114
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,149
Hey.

115
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,867
What are we
all talking about?

116
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:17,985
Ewoks.

117
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:19,253
Ugh, I hate the Ewoks.

118
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,472
The only good
thing about Ewoks in that movie?

119
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:23,373
You got to see some of them die.

120
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,010
Well, I fancy a pint.

121
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:28,979
Nora hates Ewoks.

122
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,881
Well, I have
to break up with her.

123
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:32,917
Be gentle
when you tell her, guys.

124
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,519
I'll call you from Vegas.
Tell me how it went. Okay.

125
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,487
Okay, Barney!

126
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:37,554
Sit down!

127
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:38,889
Not liking Ewoks

128
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,409
is no reason not
to date somebody.

129
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,994
Yeah, I mean, who knows
what the rules are, ya know?

130
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:46,664
I mean, you're dating
a girl who doesn't like Ewoks,

131
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,565
I'm dating my former
therapist.

132
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,617
- Oh!
- Eww!

133
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:51,452
We are
gentlemen of Harvard!

134
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:52,886
It's not a big deal!

135
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:54,699
Robin, if you asked
a hundred people,

136
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,543
"Who's the worst person
you could possibly date?"

137
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:58,125
they'd all say,
"Your therapist."

138
00:04:58,127 --> 00:04:59,877
Except the ones
saying "Barney."

139
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,263
Hey! Yeah, that tracks.

140
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,081
Well, I should
get going.

141
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,933
I got the big field
trip tomorrow.

142
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:06,801
Field trip?

143
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:07,635
Yeah. I'm taking

144
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:08,803
my Intro to
Architecture class

145
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:10,354
to the GNB Tower
construction site.

146
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,772
I'm trying to get
them interested

147
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:13,357
in architecture
as a career.

148
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,425
Why? Are we running out
of buildings?

149
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:16,894
Are we running out
of boring people?

150
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:18,646
Guys, this is
a big deal, okay?

151
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:20,781
If I can get just
one kid interested in

152
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:21,932
becoming an architect...

153
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,452
Okay, I'm just gonna stop
you right there.

154
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,487
Ted, it's an Intro class.

155
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,691
Yeah, don't try to
<i>Stand and Deliver</i>

156
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:29,440
an Intro class.

157
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:32,493
Nobody takes an Intro class
to get on any other path

158
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,246
but the path to not
being hungover anymore.

159
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:39,333
I learned that in my Intro
to something-ology class.

160
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:41,752
Well that's fine for
something-ology,

161
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:44,054
but tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m. sharp

162
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:47,258
Intro to Architecture is
going on a field trip!

163
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,642
All 200 of 'em.

164
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:49,660
Well, it's 9:45.

165
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:52,229
I guess the other 170
of you got lost,

166
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,597
so we'll just start.

167
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,101
Now, some might say you guys are
just taking this class

168
00:05:57,103 --> 00:06:00,571
because it's easy or because
you've confused architecture

169
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,356
with archaeology and think
we're gonna do

170
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:04,141
some cool
Indiana Jones stuff today.

171
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:05,943
But I think that...

172
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,666
I think just maybe, we got some
future architects in the house.

173
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:17,288
Show of hands: who's thinking
about a career in architecture?

174
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,209
Well, today,
all that's gonna change.

175
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:24,161
Follow me.

176
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,548
Hey. Uh, sorry,

177
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,450
nobody gets in here
without a site pass.

178
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:33,053
It's okay, I'm Ted Mosby, the
architect of this building.

179
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:35,472
I don't care if you're the
archaeologist of this building.

180
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,607
Site's closed.

181
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,831
Moving on!

182
00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:46,800
NARRATOR:
<i>That morning, Marshall's firm</i>

183
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:48,452
<i>was getting</i>
<i>the settlement offer</i>

184
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:50,905
<i>from Gruber Pharmaceuticals,</i>
<i>and Marshall couldn't wait</i>

185
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:53,958
<i>to see the teddy</i> <i>bear</i>
<i>turn into an Ewok.</i>

186
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,861
Gruber Pharmaceuticals dumped
toxic waste into Frog Creek,

187
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:00,548
a tributary of the Trout River
that feeds into Clearwater Lake.

188
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,717
All three of which
now need new names.

189
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:09,539
So it's time to win one
for Mother Earth.

190
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,759
Let's take out the trash,
shall we?!

191
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,011
- Yes!
- All right, everyone grab a bag.

192
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:15,813
Blue is recycling,
green, compost.

193
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,815
There we go.

194
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:20,884
Sheila...

195
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:23,003
we're ready to hear your offer.

196
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:36,667
$24,000?

197
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:43,207
Yeah , that seems reasonable.

198
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,461
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, I</i> <i>was wandering the city</i>

199
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:51,443
<i>with 25 Intro to Architecture</i>
<i>students</i>

200
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:53,478
<i>when your Uncle Barney</i>
<i>came to my rescue.</i>

201
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,115
Okay, guys, seeing a building
get built, not that exciting.

202
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:59,817
What's really exciting is the
financial side of...

203
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,285
Sit down, Ted, I got this.

204
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:04,539
Hey, Weird Beard, lights!

205
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,824
College...
it's a confusing time.

206
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:07,925
Oh, no.

207
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:11,646
Studies show that 83% of all
college students

208
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:13,681
desperately need...

209
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:15,667
sex lessons!

210
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,552
Lights!

211
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,704
Barney, these are
18-year-olds!

212
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:23,040
Ted, these are 18-year-olds!

213
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,376
You have a girlfriend.

214
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:26,594
But she doesn't like Ewoks!

215
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:27,478
So what?

216
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,566
So what?!
Bieber, lights!

217
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:37,105
In 1983, George Lucas introduced
the world to the Ewoks,

218
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:40,842
a race of creatures indigenous
to the second moon of Endor.

219
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,844
Now, the Ewoks have
a rich back-story

220
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:44,245
that the movie didn't
really go into.

221
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,413
Barney, why don't
you just skip

222
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:47,498
to the part
about you and Nora?

223
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,250
(sighs) Fine.

224
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,077
Ah, yes.

225
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,348
Ultimately, Ewoks split <i>Star</i>
<i>Wars</i> fandom into two camps:

226
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,437
those born before, and those
born after May 25, 1973:

227
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:12,640
the Ewok Line.

228
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:15,727
Anyone born on this side
of the Ewok Line was

229
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,129
at least ten years
old when Jedi came out,

230
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:22,433
and thus too old for something
so cloying and cute.

231
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:29,373
Anyone born on this side
loved the Ewoks because, why?

232
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:32,410
They reminded you of...

233
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,494
Our teddies?

234
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,963
They reminded you
of your teddies.

235
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,799
Thank you, Gina.

236
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,584
How do you know her name?

237
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:44,121
And so... by the immutable laws
of the Ewok Line,

238
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:48,593
my 29-year-old girlfriend
who hates Ewoks

239
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:54,315
must in fact be
no younger than... 37.

240
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,601
That's only a year younger
than Will's mom.

241
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:58,820
How do you know my mom?
Class dismissed!

242
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:00,321
I need to be alone.

243
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:01,806
All right, we're moving on.

244
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:03,191
Ooh, can I come?

245
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:05,276
(cell phone rings)
Hey, baby.

246
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,780
Hey, I just want to remind you
we have Dr. Sonya at 4:00.

247
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:11,482
I'll be there. I'm sorry.
I'm just... I'm bummed.

248
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:14,035
We got
our settlement offer today:

249
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:17,321
$24,000 from
a billion-dollar company.

250
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,774
Wow. I take it people aren't
happy about that.

251
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,827
We won! Champagne and cake
for everybody!

252
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:23,961
They're celebrating.

253
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:24,962
I mean, it's crazy.

254
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:27,431
We have no right
to be eating cake.

255
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,851
There's cake?! I'm on my way!

256
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:33,337
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, the worst field trip</i>
<i>of all time was still trucking.</i>

257
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,307
All right, this, <i>this</i> is
exciting, okay?

258
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:37,692
This is the very room

259
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:40,144
where I had the idea
for the GNB Tower.

260
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:43,013
Now, Webster's defines
"inspiration" as...

261
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:45,700
Hold on.
It's still loading.

262
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:46,701
Uh, hey, roomie.

263
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:49,403
Robin! Hey,
what are you doing here?

264
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:52,156
Well, I <i>was</i> about
to get my swerve on.

265
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,041
You were?

266
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:56,460
So you're the therapist.

267
00:10:56,462 --> 00:10:59,580
You know, it's one thing
to pretend to be a shrink

268
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:01,632
and bang your patients.
That's normal.

269
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:05,336
But to do it for real?
A little creepy, bro.

270
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:06,921
Okay, it's not creepy.

271
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:09,006
BOTH:
Ehhhh... it's creepy.

272
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:10,842
Class, show of hands:

273
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,711
Who thinks it's creepy
to date your therapist?

274
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:15,346
- Pollstered.
- Get out!

275
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:17,381
All right.
We're moving on!

276
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,716
So, class, to your left,

277
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:21,402
you will see some
excellent examples of

278
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:25,072
what we'd call windows.

279
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,908
So where are we going now?

280
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,909
I have no idea.

281
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,410
This is a disaster.

282
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,395
Some of them are already
starting to go home.

283
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:34,081
Although we seem to have
picked up a German family.

284
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,000
BARNEY: Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

285
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:38,736
That thing with Robin
and her creepy therapist

286
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:39,737
gave me an idea.

287
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,706
Ted, we have here a way

288
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,575
to solve every single debate
we've ever had!

289
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:46,410
I mean, just look at the sample:

290
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,463
guys, girls,
blacks, Asians, a German family.

291
00:11:49,465 --> 00:11:52,049
You can't pay for that kind of
focus group!

292
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,752
Is macaroni salad
really a salad?

293
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,253
Hands up if you say "no."

294
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:58,272
Ha!

295
00:11:58,274 --> 00:11:59,273
Jacob or Edward?

296
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:00,257
Who says Edward?

297
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,226
Ha, ha. See?
I told you.

298
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,612
It's Edward
James Olmos.

299
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:08,282
Would you rather have sex
with a dead human being

300
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:11,035
or a live an...?
Dude.

301
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,603
What?
Find the line.

302
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:15,072
Who thinks David
Hasselhoff is awesome?

303
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,742
Hmm.
It's true.

304
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,460
Okay. I've got one.
If you're dating a girl,

305
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:20,962
and she lies
about her age,

306
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,930
who says break up
with her?

307
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:25,166
Yes, yes, but what if
the person she's lying to

308
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:27,284
is notoriously
shallow about age?

309
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:29,637
Okay, but what if early
in our relationship,

310
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,972
she made a really big deal

311
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,590
about wanting to not
lie to each other?

312
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,642
What if she's hot?

313
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,677
Who wants five bucks?

314
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,263
Pollstered!

315
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,765
Let's do this.

316
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,183
(giggling)

317
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:44,235
(clears throat)

318
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:46,971
(murmurs)
Hmm? Yeah.

319
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:47,989
(giggling)

320
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,990
Mm...

321
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:50,491
Okay, this is creepy.

322
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:51,993
It's Crispin
Glover creepy.

323
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,411
You were my patient.

324
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,695
You shared intimate stuff.

325
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,497
It would be like dating
your gynecologist.

326
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,616
You were vulnerable.

327
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:01,118
That's not something
we can move past.

328
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,287
(sighs)
Guess not.

329
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:07,508
So, dating your gyno,
that's bad, too?

330
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,676
Oh, Robin.

331
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:10,378
Kidding!

332
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,079
Look, we've got another one!

333
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,098
(laughing)

334
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,499
Come on,
have a bite.

335
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:17,385
No, it's a matter
of principle.

336
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:18,853
I don't care how good it is,

337
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:20,471
I'm not gonna have
a third piece of cake!

338
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:24,508
Okay, guys, you all had
a lot of fun today,

339
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,395
but now it's time...
to have even more fun!

340
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:29,597
Another cake!

341
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,365
MARSHALL: Another cake?!

342
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,317
What is the matter
with you people?!

343
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:37,855
That settlement today was
a flaming pile of...

344
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,757
puppies...

345
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,542
that aren't on fire!

346
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,711
Look at what's happening
to the environment,

347
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:45,413
and we're here doing the limbo?

348
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:48,499
I mean, we should be ashamed
of ourselves!

349
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:59,510
Sir, all I meant was...

350
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,896
Ten years from right now,

351
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:05,049
everyone outside in that bullpen
will be dead.

352
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,517
What?

353
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,436
I've seen the
latest research, Marsh.

354
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:10,004
You know how I'm always saying

355
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,023
it's not too late
to save the planet?

356
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,058
It's too late
to save the planet.

357
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,244
There's nothing to do
but sit back

358
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:20,931
and await our inevitable doom.

359
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:22,333
(noisemaker tooting)

360
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:23,901
Oh, my goodness, a piñata!

361
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:25,336
Just give me one minute, Larry.

362
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:26,904
Thank you.

363
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:30,257
Our grotesque, inevitable doom!

364
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,044
Now, of course,
you can't go around

365
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,095
telling all the people

366
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:35,846
that the good ship
<i>Environmentalism</i>

367
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:37,414
has sailed off into the sunset.

368
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,050
There would cause a panic.

369
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,901
So, instead,
what we do is,

370
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:43,354
we come to work,
we put on a happy face,

371
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:45,606
and we sue the big guys

372
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:48,092
for just enough money
for some cake

373
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:52,563
before the unfiltered rays
of the sun fry us like chalupas,

374
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:55,533
and our lungs fill up
with salt water,

375
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:57,952
and we all die!

376
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:00,538
Mmm. This cake is delicious.
Everything's fine.

377
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:05,764
Ugh, this day sucks.

378
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,213
Kevin and I are kaputski.

379
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:09,831
You think that's bad?

380
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,167
The world is
coming to an end.

381
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,069
You think that's bad?

382
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:18,206
My girlfriend is 37!

383
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,510
And my field trip is not going
as well as I'd hoped.

384
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,662
Hmm.

385
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,564
This day sucks.

386
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:28,183
Professor Mosby,
is the field trip over?

387
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:30,018
We'd like to go home.

388
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,603
Yeah, it's over.

389
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,772
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

390
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,440
I just wanted
to inspire them,

391
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:38,893
you know, like my professors
inspired me.

392
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:42,114
But here we are,
at the end of the day...

393
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:43,665
Hey, class,
quick question.

394
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,418
Uh, is anyone here thinking
of becoming an architect?

395
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,172
(clucks tongue)

396
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:53,759
Really?

397
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:55,928
Yeah, dude.
I mean,

398
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,579
all jobs suck,

399
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,581
but it's 4:00
in the afternoon,

400
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,550
and you're out at a bar
with your friends,

401
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,769
so the hours can't
be that bad.

402
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,387
So...

403
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,773
yeah, I don't know,
I'd think about it.

404
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:11,092
(voice cracking):
I got through to you. Oh!

405
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:14,763
I mean, that is, if becoming
a deejay doesn't pan out.

406
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,983
You are gonna be
a great architect.

407
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:20,101
NARRATOR:
<i>He became a deejay.</i>

408
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,072
Robin, what are you doing here?

409
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:25,614
I told you I can't
be your therapist.

410
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,459
I know.

411
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,943
Today, I am your therapist.

412
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:29,944
What?

413
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,163
You said yourself,

414
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,415
I'm always looking for reasons
not to be happy.

415
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,334
Well, I'm trying to change that.

416
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:37,452
So, if the only reason
we can't be together

417
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,454
is because I was
in a vulnerable place

418
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,139
for the first two hours
we knew each other

419
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:45,427
then that is two hours of
vulnerability you owe me.

420
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:47,346
Sit down.

421
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,297
Okay.

422
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,819
Okay, but I must warn you, as a
professional, I'm immune to...

423
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:54,786
Tell me about your mother.

424
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,934
Everything she says
is a manipulation!

425
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,273
When I was
seven years old...

426
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,941
Mr. Cootes.

427
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:01,827
- Hey.
- Listen, I've been thinking

428
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,745
a lot about what you said
yesterday,

429
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,280
about how we're all gonna die.

430
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:06,581
Oh, I'm not gonna die.

431
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,701
I bought an old mine shaft
in Colorado.

432
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:12,738
I've spent the last six months
filling it with canned goods,

433
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,874
assault rifles and all five
seasons of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i>

434
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:18,760
Okay, first of all,
you can skip season two.

435
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:22,163
Second of all, after our talk...

436
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:25,751
I came pretty close
to giving up myself.

437
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,304
But then I went to the doctor
with my wife...

438
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:30,305
and...

439
00:17:30,307 --> 00:17:31,640
(taps key)

440
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,942
I saw this.

441
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:38,380
Boy or girl?

442
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:40,515
I don't know.

443
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,285
But I know I sure as hell
can't give up now.

444
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,737
So, if you're just looking
for someone

445
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:48,123
to hold the other end
of the limbo stick,

446
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,209
you got the wrong guy for
the job, and you know why?

447
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,962
'Cause you're three feet taller
than everyone in this office?

448
00:17:53,964 --> 00:17:56,965
No. Because if I am
gonna work here,

449
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,800
then first thing
tomorrow morning,

450
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:00,869
I'm walking down
to Gruber Pharmaceuticals,

451
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,838
and I'm rejecting their offer.

452
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,173
Even if I have to do it myself.

453
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:07,175
(door opens)

454
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:11,680
Listen, I want you
to know... I know.

455
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:12,681
Know what?

456
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,282
Nora.

457
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:15,684
Barney.

458
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:16,718
Nora.

459
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,219
Just say what you're gonna say!

460
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:19,604
I know you're old!

461
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:22,157
And I've been struggling
with it,

462
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,059
but when I look at you...

463
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:27,395
I don't care,
because I really like you.

464
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:32,567
And because for 37,
you are keeping it toit!

465
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,870
You think I'm 37?

466
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,822
Well, if you were really 29,

467
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,117
then you would have
been a little kid

468
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,009
the first time you saw the Ewoks
and you would have loved them.

469
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,474
Barney, I didn't see
any of the <i>Star Wars</i>

470
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:43,944
movies until last year.

471
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,884
You... you're 29!

472
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:52,086
You still have
one good year left.

473
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:54,272
- What?
- Nothing.

474
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,807
Mm...

475
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,476
But Naveen's the neurosurgeon,

476
00:18:57,478 --> 00:18:59,594
so of course he gets
all the attention!

477
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,896
Oh, Naveen is so smart,

478
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:03,815
he operates on people's brains!

479
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:05,901
Well, guess what, Mom?!

480
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,620
I treat the human mind!

481
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:10,622
Our time is up.

482
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:11,940
(exhales)

483
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,708
I don't think
this is gonna work.

484
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,410
I scared you off, didn't I?

485
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:19,164
No, I mean, I don't think
I can be your therapist.

486
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,800
You're really cute.

487
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,486
NARRATOR:
<i>The next day,</i>

488
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:26,671
<i>Marshall returned to</i>
<i>Gruber Pharmaceuticals alone.</i>

489
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:29,791
I mean, you admit
that you polluted the lake.

490
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,959
We got the evidence.

491
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,961
We got the charts.

492
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,147
The fish...

493
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,683
Fish, huh?

494
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:40,569
Fish are weird.

495
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:43,205
You ever think
about the names of fish?

496
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:44,689
I mean, come on.

497
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:45,974
Carp.

498
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,910
Garrison, what a nice surprise.

499
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:51,413
Your star apprentice
was just, uh...

500
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:53,081
"Floundering."

501
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,083
Little, little
fish humor

502
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:56,418
for you guys.

503
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,752
It was not going well.

504
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,455
I'm here to turn
down the 24,000.

505
00:20:00,457 --> 00:20:04,342
Well, I can maybe get you
24,500.

506
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:09,881
Not... good... enough.

507
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,170
Where are we going?

508
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:18,440
To war, son.

509
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:21,226
We're going to war.

510
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:25,397
We're going to save the planet.

NARRATOR: <i>And kids, as we now know,</i>
<i>they did.</i>

512
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:34,772
Hey, you know
what was on last night?

513
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,144
- <i>Stand and Deliver.</i>
- Mm.

514
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,369
- So good.
- Mm-hmm.

515
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:40,344
Whatever happened
to Jacob James Olmos?

516
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:41,545
Who?

517
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:44,515
Jacob James Olmos.
Whatever happened to that guy?

518
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,216
He never existed.

519
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:47,484
It's Edward James Olmos.

520
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:49,186
You're Olmos correct.

521
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:51,555
It's Jacob James Olmos.

522
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:53,607
- It's Edward James Olmos.
- Jacob James Olmos.

523
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:55,278
Edward James Olmos.

524
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:56,320
- You're joking, right...?
- Are you serious...?
