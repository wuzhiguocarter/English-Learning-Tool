- The reservation is in 15 minutes.
- Shh!

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:06,953
He's back.

4
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,422
Every night
at exactly 8:00 p.m.,

5
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,841
the well-dressed
blond man appears.

6
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:14,677
WOMAN:
Chuck and Joanne

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,462
are going to be waiting.
You don't understand!

8
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,014
Every night, he does this.

9
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:20,633
Every single night.

10
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:22,769
He steps out of this building,

11
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,755
walks exactly seven paces,
stops,

12
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:28,391
and smiles.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,155
Honey, I am worried about you.

14
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:43,823
Is he trying to communicate
with someone?

15
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:45,491
Is he trying
to communicate with me?

16
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,460
Why is he doing this?!

17
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:48,795
But aside from
not being able

18
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:51,547
to fart in the apartment,
how's living with Quinn?

19
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:53,319
Oh, it's great.

23
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,464
Living with Quinn
is great.

24
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:11,901
Great, great,

25
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:12,602
So how bad is it?

26
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:13,403
Pretty bad.

27
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:14,237
Last night,

28
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,972
I had just come back

29
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:17,139
from my 8:00 fart.

30
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:17,640
Sure.

31
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:18,574
Go on.

32
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:20,410
Still no mail.

33
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:22,495
I think they only deliver it
once a day.

34
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:23,780
Hey, listen,

35
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:26,082
when I moved in here,
I sold all my stuff

36
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:27,867
because I know you like
your place as is,

37
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,419
and I was totally fine
with that.

38
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:32,205
Just one little thing:
would it be okay

39
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:34,457
if instead of using
your coffee mugs,

40
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,758
we use mine?

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,544
Hmm...

42
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:40,430
No.

43
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:43,466
Barney, she got rid
of all of her stuff for you.

44
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,468
Oh, I see what this
is really about.

45
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,837
Yeah, mugs.

46
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,855
Coffee?

47
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:50,390
Tea?

48
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,558
Eh, religion.

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,311
This is about the fact
that you don't think

50
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,513
this relationship
is gonna last.

51
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,033
That's why you don't want
to throw anything out.

52
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:02,402
Because when
that inevitable breakup comes,

53
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:04,353
you don't want
to buy new mugs.

54
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,789
That's why I've never
thrown anything out

55
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,158
for any relationship ever.

56
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,861
Isn't that right, honey?

57
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:13,830
Oh, that's right. I'm alone.

58
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:15,999
Lily, here's the thing.

59
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,083
It's my apartment,

60
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:20,586
and I need to assert
my dominance as a man.

61
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:23,139
Don't ever say that...

62
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:26,009
to any girl ever.

63
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:28,094
Too late.

64
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:29,679
What did you just say to me?

65
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,681
- She gave up her apartment for you!
- You said that to her?!

66
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,932
Okay, you know what?

67
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:35,818
I don't have to sit here and
take this from you ladies.

68
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,386
I'm going to Ted's.

69
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:38,888

70
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,556
where guys can be guys.

71
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,575
- Assert your dominance?
- It's like you have no respect for women.

72
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:44,226
- What is wrong with you?
- You have a mother!

73
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:45,695
You guys, too?

74
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,197
(scoffs)
I'm going to the Y for a shvitz.

75
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,999
No, dude, hold on.

76
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,417
You're not going anywhere.

77
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,336
It's trilogy time.

78
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,737

79
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,440
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, here's the deal</i>
<i>with trilogy time:</i>

80
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:02,178
It all started a long time ago
<i>in a dorm room far, far away.</i>

81
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,463
Dude, if we fail
this econ final,

82
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,414
for the rest of our lives
we're not gonna be able to...

83
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,100
We won't know how to...

84
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:09,052
Do you even know what econ is?

85
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,686
No idea. We're screwed.

86
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:14,690
But there's only one thing
left to do at at time like this.

87
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:16,759
Watch the entire <i>Star Wars</i>
trilogy all the way through

88
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,694
because I haven't done that
in, like, five years.

89
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:20,063
Dude, you can't let that happen.

90
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,398
If you're not trilling it
at least once every three years,

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,100
the Dark Side wins.

92
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:25,485
Okay, let's make a pact.

93
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,436
No matter what,
every three years,

94
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:29,622
we sit down
and trill it up big time.

95
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:30,740
Agreed?

96
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:33,242
A-Greedo.

97
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:35,444
Wow.

98
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:37,497
2003, I mean...

99
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,499
What's that gonna be like?

100
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,888
Hey, Ted.

101
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,173
Sweet hair.

102
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,725
I told you it would
eventually stop growing out

103
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:51,460
and start growing down.

104
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:52,845
Anyway, I'm just working

105
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,464
on designing
yet another skyscraper.

106
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,649
And I'm carrying this briefcase

107
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,136
because now
I'm a successful lawyer...

108
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:01,104
I like that.

109
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:03,272
Can I make one adjustment?

110

112
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:08,528
And who knows, by then,

113
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,163
you and Lily might be engaged.

114
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:13,499
Engaged? Bro, I'm gonna do
way better than that.

115
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:18,004
Ah, being pregnant
is so much fun.

116
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:20,206
I want to do this
four more times.

117
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,491
Oh, baby, how do you feel

118
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,459
after spending all day
working on your art,

119
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:26,562
since I make enough to
support us both financially?

120
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:27,630
Horny.

121
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:29,498
I hope we don't
bother you, Ted,

122
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,634
because even though
we're married and pregnant,

123
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,002
it still makes sense

124
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:36,422
that we all share
adult-sized bunk beds.

I like to stay up late

By the way, guys, this is Lisa.

180
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,857
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Lisa.

181
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,695
And they never saw her again.

182
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:58,147
Whassaaaa!

183
00:06:58,149 --> 00:06:59,699
Okay,

184
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,701
three years ago,
we had this whole fantasy

185
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:03,452
about how great
our lives were gonna be,

186
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:04,704
and it didn't pan out.

187
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:06,872
But I'm telling you,
three years from now,

188
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:09,041
when we're watching
the trilogy in 2006,

189
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:11,510
our lives
are gonna be awesome.

190
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:13,713
(classical music playing)

191
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:19,919
Ah, hello, Ted.

192
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:22,338
I'm an environmental lawyer now.

193
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,140
Sure, it's not
the most lucrative field,

194
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:26,442
but luckily I have
the cash and prizes

195
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,644
from my historic seven-week run

196
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:31,230
on <i>Wheel of Fortune...</i>

197
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:33,366
Can I just make
one little adjustment?

198
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:37,203
...for which I was knighted
by Her Majesty, the Queen.

199
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,538
Ah, Lady Aldrin.

200
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,457
Oh, Sir Marshall.

201
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,292
I cannot wait to get a house

202
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,127
down the street
from your parents

203
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,831
so we can be close to your mom,
whom I get along with now.

204
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,166
Good, good.

205
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,584
But here's the best part.

206
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,502
Rhiannon, hurry!

207
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,471
Just because I designed
the opera house

208
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:58,224
doesn't mean they'll hold
the curtain for us.

209
00:07:58,226 --> 00:07:59,642
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

210
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:00,976
Of course it does.

211
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:03,095
Take your time, my love.

212
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:06,215
Hey, guys, it's me again.

213
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:07,900
I'm pretty much
the same as last time,

214
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:10,853
only now I'm super-rich
and fancy.

215
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:13,722
(speaking French):

216
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:17,860
And it still makes sense
that we all live together.

217
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,829
(laughter)

218
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,280
What about you, Barney?

219
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:23,115
Any predictions for 2006?

220
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:25,117
Oh, yeah. Picture it.

221
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,403
By the way, guys,
this is Jody.

222
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:30,289
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Jody.

223
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:34,243
And they never saw her again.

224
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:36,962
Whassaaaa!

225
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:40,349
How is that any different
from your life right now?

226
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,218
It's not. I'm KFC, baby.

227
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,253
You don't mess
with the Colonel's recipe.

228
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:46,806
I want things to stay
exactly the same,

229
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,424
but with a different hottie.

230
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,810
'Cause Barney don't slurp
no sloppy seconds,

231
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,896
especially his own.

232
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,531
Okay, the bottom line is

233
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,149
things are gonna get better.

234
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,485
Well, all I care about is
getting into law school.

235
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,936
You will.

236
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:03,689
2006 is gonna be awesome.

237
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:09,662
And look what happened.

238
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,330
You got into law school,

239
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:12,965
just like I said you would.

240
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:15,217
See, things aren't so bad.

241
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:16,618
Lily left me.

242
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:21,390
And now I'll never have
a mustache.

243
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,390
Baby, there you are.

244
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:32,060
I have spent all day thinking
about all the naughty,

245
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:34,429
naughty things
you and I are gonna do

246
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:35,463
to cheer up Marshall.

247
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:37,432
Like what?

248
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,766
Um...

249
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:41,135
Uh, I'll you guys
hang out, okay?

250
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,737
Um, I'll just be...

251
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:43,738
waiting in the bedroom.

252
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,822
(giggles, groans)

253
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,357
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean that

254
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:49,394
to sound like Ted and I are
gonna do a kind of thing.

255
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:54,482
Okay, okay.

256
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,833
See you.

257
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:57,085
Marshall, this will pass.

258
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:58,252
Trust me.

259
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,338
Three years from now...

260
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:03,658
Briefcase, lawyer,

261
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,009
knighthood, mustache,

262
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:06,878
all that stuff from before.

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,513
Congratulations, bro.

264
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:10,348
And congratulations
to you too, Ted,

265
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,133
for locking this down.

266
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:14,552
You know, it's weird,

267
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:16,187
I never thought I
would get married,

268
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:17,438
but you talked me into it.

269
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,607
Or rather, banged
me into it.

270
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,392
You're so good in bed, ooh.

271
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:23,511
(kissing noisily)

272
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:25,113
How is this helping me?

273
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm getting to it.

274
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:30,368
In three years, not only
will Lily be back, but...

275
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,188
(sighs) It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

276
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,125
and be carrying his child.

277
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:39,377
I think you're being
kind of optimistic, Ted.

278
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,963
Can I make
one little adjustment?

279
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:45,983
(sighs) It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

280
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,635
and carrying his child,

281
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:49,754
and here he is now.

282
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:51,889
Guys, I want you to meet

283
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,841
some douchey guy named Trey.

284
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,094
- 'Sup, bro?
- Mmm.

285
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,878
I don't know
what I love more:

286
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,647
his thick mustache

287
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:00,732
or his trucker hat.

288
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,767
You know I hate those hats.

289
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,436
Then you're really gonna
hate this sonogram.

290
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,026
Nooo...

291
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:15,229
ooo...!

292
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:19,951
(chuckles) A baby in a trucker hat.
That's awesome.

293
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:21,018
Anyway,
Ted's right.

294
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,504
2009's gonna rule.

295
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,506
By the way, guys,
this is Maya.

296
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:29,427
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

297
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,595
(laughs)

298
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:32,430
And they never saw her again.

299
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:33,914
Whassaaaa!

300
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,082
Okay, seriously,

301
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:36,350
at least tell me
you're gonna

302
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:38,085
change the what
will by then be

303
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,420
nine-year-old beer
commercial reference.

304
00:11:39,422 --> 00:11:40,354
I mean,
come on.

305
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,606
There's got to be
at least one way

306
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,191
that you'd like the future
to be different.

307
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,777
I guess there is one thing.

308
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,595
By the way, guys, this is Maya.

309
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:49,731
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

310
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,866
And not because
of these these.

311
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:55,019
Because of <i>these.</i>

312
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:57,989
Back boobs--
the visual stimulation

313
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:00,074
of missionary meets
the emotional detachment

314
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:01,409
of doggy-style.

315
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:02,710
Patent pending.

316
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:04,078
Whassaaaa!

317
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,113
The point is, Marshall,

318
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:10,017
this time in three years,
everything is gonna be great.

319
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:16,307
See? Lily came back.

320
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,427
Of course, Robin and I
didn't end up together.

321
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,512
But I did get engaged.

322
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:23,314
And left at the altar.

323
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:25,349
But I did start
my own architectural firm.

324
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:27,101
And it failed
after a few months.

325
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:29,103
- Can we put the movie on, please?
- Yeah.

326
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:29,937
Sure, buddy.

327
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:31,472
Hey, by the way,
where is Robin?

328
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,324
<i>In the summer of 2009,</i>

329
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,426
<i>Barney and Robin</i>
<i>were secretly dating.</i>

330
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,945
Oh, uh, Barney said she's
taking some extension class

331
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:39,664
in how to decoupage,
and Barney's taking

332
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,649
a different decoupage class
in the same building.

333
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,918
That's why they shared
that cab that one time.

334
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,255
<i>We were idiots.</i>

335
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:49,156
Wait a minute.

336
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:53,744
You're saying that Barney Stinson
is at a decoupage class?

337
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,964
That means we can watch
<i>Star Wars</i> on his giant TV!

338
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,800
Punch it, Chewy!

339
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:05,223
(panting, moaning)
Oh.

340
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:06,340
You're back
from decoupage.

341
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:07,692
What's decoupage?

342
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:10,394
Oh, uh, yeah, I took that
cab there that one time.

343
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:11,896
Hold on.

344
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:16,016
Come on in.

345
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:19,520
We were hoping we could
watch the trilogy here.

346
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:22,456
Uh, sure. But, uh...

347
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,692
first go look out
my, uh, bedroom window.

348
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:26,661
There's a, uh...

349
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:29,463
naked lady, uh...

350
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:32,032
jumping up and down
on a mini-trampoline

351
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:34,752
in the apartment
across the, uh...

352
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:36,220
street.

353
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,672
(gasps, laughs)

354
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:43,644
(whispering):
Get me out of this thing!

355
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:44,929
There's no time!

356
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,265
Barney, I am not ready for them
to find out about us.

357
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,383
Then you're gonna have to stay
in there for the entire trilogy.

358
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,652
Don't worry. It's
only 382 minutes.

359
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:52,987
Nerd!

360
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:58,109
So, where do you guys think
we'll be in three years?

361
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,894
It'll be 2012.

362
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,779
(chuckles)
That's an easy one.

363
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,014
Guys, this is Sophia.

364
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,066
(glass shatters)
You'll be seeing a lot more of...

365
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:08,819
MARSHALL:
Okay, that is so weird.

366
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:12,139
I was just trying
to use the force.

367
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,592
Do you think instead
of making a beer

368
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:17,595
fly out of the fridge,
I made that lamp break?

369
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,764
Either that
or the stormtrooper did.

370
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:20,848
(laughter)

371
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,634
Oh, the stormtrooper
would never do that.

372
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:27,154
He knows that lamp costs $1,200.

373
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:29,590
Anyway, while it's just us guys,

374
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:32,777
let me ask you something:
we've all had that same fantasy

375
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:36,864
about having sex with a girl in
a stormtrooper costume, right?

376
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:39,533
- Mmm, no.
- Never.

377
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:40,985
Guys...

378
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:43,537
come on, no girls around,
just us bros.

379
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,789
Safe space.

380
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,441
Let's stop being polite
and start gettin' real.

381
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:49,460
Stormtrooper fantasy.

382
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:51,245
Every guy's had that one, right?

383
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:53,881
Not even once, no.
No, no, no.

384
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,634
So I'm the weird one?

385
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,285
Yeah.
Yeah.

386
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,587
Yeah.

387
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:00,671
How about you, Ted?

388
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,624
How's your life gonna
be different

389
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:05,643
Oh, you know,
the usual.

390
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:07,895
Gonna meet a nice girl
and get married.

391
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:10,431
I mean, I know I say that
every year, but...

392
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:13,267
let's be honest,
in 2012, I'll be 34.

393
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,102
If it still hasn't
happened for me by then,

394
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:19,190
(laughing): something is seriously
wrong with me!

395
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:23,995
(laughter continues)

396
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,770
Something is seriously wrong
with me.

397
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:38,754
I can't do
this anymore.

398
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:40,105
I can't
keep smiling

399
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,840
and being optimistic
all the time

400
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:44,009
when all the evidence
points to the contrary.

401
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,228
You really think
that three years from now

402
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,679
things aren't gonna be awesome?

403
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,982
I'll tell you what
things are gonna be like

404
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:52,000
three years from now.

405
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:56,088
Uh, yes, hello. I see

406
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,642
on my frozen entree for one
they printed this number

407
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:03,345
where I can voice
comments and concerns.

408
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:06,014
Well, there's more cinnamon

409
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:08,884
in the cobbler than usual.

410
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,253
No, I like cinnamon.

411
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:16,692
Oh, you're very welcome
for my comment.

412
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:20,262
Wait! Uh, don't go.

413
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:22,931
Um... do you like cinnamon?

414
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,983
Hello? Hello?

415
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,859
Marshall, you want
to watch <i>Star Wars?</i>

416
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:35,444
No, can do, old bean!

417
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:36,928
You see, we're up on the Cape

418
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,313
living the idyllic
family lifestyle

419
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,764
that you've always
dreamed of.

420
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:44,353
Oh, and I'm pregnant
with baby #5!

421
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:46,321
But baby #4 isn't even out yet.

422
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:48,073
I'm just that good!
(chuckles)

423
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,207
Oh, oh, hold on.

424
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,942
There's somebody wants
to say hello to you.

425
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,444
(chuckles softly)

426
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,662
Hey, Ted.

427
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,881
I just wanted to say
that things are great,

428
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:58,900
and I'm married to that
douchey guy in the trucker hat.

429
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:00,335
Whassup, bra?

430
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:03,455
It turns out it was just <i>you</i>

431
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,190
I didn't want to commit to.

432
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,124
(laughter)

433
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,125
Oh,

434
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,628
and I got back boobs.
(giggles)

435
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,646
So things are great!

436
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:12,948
Buh-bye!

437
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,149
(squeals)

438
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:16,068
(laughter)

439
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,769
(laughter)

440
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,771
By the way, Ted,
this is Melanie.

441
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,773
You'll be seeing a
lot more of Melanie.

442
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,075
BARNEY:
<i>Wait-wait-wait a minute!</i>

443
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,409
Who is Melanie?

444
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,495
Come on, Barney, if there's
one thing I can count on

445
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:27,779
not to change,
it's you walking in

446
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,364
with some random
girl on your arm.

447
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,783
No. No, I don't want that.

448
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,085
For the first time

449
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,203
in my life, I don't
want to find myself

450
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,172
in three years
with some random girl,

451
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:39,157
no matter
how many boobs she has.

452
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,893
I want to be with Quinn.

453
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,664
Guys...

454
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,884
you're gonna be seeing
a lot more of Quinn.

455
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:51,353
Dude, we've been to the
Lusty Leopard. We've seen plenty.

456
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,139
I kind of walked into that one.
All right, bye-bye.

457
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,062
What are you doing?

458
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:02,781
We're living together,
I'm excited about it,

459
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,750
and I'm getting
rid of my mugs.

460
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:07,319
That was mine.

461
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,738
Sorry. I don't know
which are which.

462
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,041
Truth is, I never
drink coffee at home.

463
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:14,493
This one?
Mm-hmm.

464
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,211
There!

465
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:18,413
I don't need my coffee mugs
'cause I got yours!

466
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:20,215
For the rest of my life.

467
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:22,968
Or as... long as
you'll have me.

468
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,220
We haven't really talked
about the future.

469
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:27,372
Did I make things awkward?

470
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:28,807
Just keep smashing mugs.

471
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:29,891
(chuckles)

472
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:32,260
Or donate them.

473
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:34,095
Point is,

474
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:37,015
I plan on being with you
for a long time.

475
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,934
You okay with that?

476
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,390
Sounds great.

477
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,811
(farts)
Ooh.. Oh!

478
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,699
I am so sorry.

479
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,951
No, no, it's great.

480
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:59,087
A guy has to be the first one
to let 'er rip.

481
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,173
I was actually hoping
this would happen soon.

482
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,741
I've been crop-dusting
the patio for weeks.

483
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,577
- The <i>patio!</i>
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,579
I've been going
out on the street,

485
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,682
like, exactly this time
every night.

486
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:13,185
Where are you, blond man?!

487
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,554
Show yourself!

488
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:18,523
I will be at my mother's.

489
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,758
We're a real couple now,
aren't we?

490
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,811
We are.

491
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,396
(chuckles softly)

492
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:26,598
(both fart)

493
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,768
(chuckles)

494
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,654
Hey, buddy, I get
that you're bummed.

495
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:35,773
But I got a good feeling
about 2015.

496
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,076
I think that's
gonna be your year.

497
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:41,046
<i>Kids, that was the one time</i>
<i>I ever lost faith</i>

498
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:44,282
<i>in the idea that my life</i>
<i>would be better in three years.</i>

499
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,219
<i>And what's funny is,</i>
<i>three years from that moment,</i>

500
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,254
<i>my life was amazing.</i>

501
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,839
All right!
It's trilogy time!

502
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,624
Can I just lodge
one complaint?

503
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,059
This is a guy's tradition.

504
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,645
It's kind of a lame move
on Ted's part to bring a chick.

505
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:59,231
Come on, dude...
cut him some slack.

506
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,482
I know. He loves her.

507
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:03,151
And I'll give him this:
she is pretty damn cute.

508
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:05,570
Thank God she takes
after her mother.

509
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:09,024
All right,
let's watch this thing!

510
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:10,692
TV...

511
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:14,979
play <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy.

512
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,451
Play <i>Star Wars</i> tril...

513
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,369
You know what?
Screw it.

514
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,691
Okay, you are about to see
something awesome.

515
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,493
And just know this:

516
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,745
Han shot first.

517
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:34,266
I wonder if things'll
be a lot different

518
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:37,719
when we watch the trilogy
again in 2018.

519
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:40,071
I hope not.

520
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,515
(panting)

521
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,884
Oh, that was awesome.

522
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,321
You were right--
not weird.

523
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:55,855
No.
