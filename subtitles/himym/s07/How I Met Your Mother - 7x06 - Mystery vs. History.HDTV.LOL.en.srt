00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:03,471
OLDER TED: <i>By the fall of 2011,</i>
<i>technology had taken</i>

2
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:06,640
<i>a lot of the intrigue</i>
<i>out of life.</i>

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:11,024
<i>The Internet had everyone's</i>
<i>wall of information.</i>

4
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:15,611
<i>Nothing was a mystery anymore.</i>

5
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:20,008
<i>But, kids, there was</i>
<i>a time before that,</i>

6
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,476
<i>way back in the dark ages.</i>

7
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:23,877
Are you people insane?!

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,364
The most popular food in America
is the cheeseburger!

9
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,848
No way! It's pizza!

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,068
Are we forgetting about
a certain Mr. Furter,

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,653
first name Frank?

12
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:35,055
Um, what did every kid
bring in their lunchbox

13
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,224
every day till
grade eight?

14
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:38,892
Pancakes with
maple syrup.

15
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,162
Thanks, Canada.

16
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,914
We're looking for a food
the average <i>American</i> eats.

17
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,399
MARSHALL: Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh!

18
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:46,701
Chinese food.

19
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:49,170
<i>And then came the smartphone.</i>

20
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,340
Hey, remember

21
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:55,760
when we were arguing about
the most popular food?

22
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,045
It's bread.

23
00:00:58,047 --> 00:00:59,797
OTHERS:
Hm.

24
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,183
<i>And the barroom debate</i>
<i>was dead.</i>

25
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,251
BARNEY:
<i>You guys are idiots!</i>

26
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:07,054
NARRATOR: <i>Okay, not completely dead.</i>
You are seriously telling me

27
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:08,556
you don't want
to open that envelope

28
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,758
and find out if you're
having a boy or a girl?

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,445
Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us
this in case we wanted to know.

30
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:16,147
But we don't.

31
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,816
Lilypad and I are just gonna
wait till that baby pops out

32
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:20,201
and enjoy the big surprise.

33
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,903
Look, I have pretended
to be a licensed therapist

34
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:25,072
enough times to know
there is something unhealthy

35
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:26,907
about your not wanting
to find out.

36
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,160
- Back me up here, Kev.
- No, no, no, no, no.

37
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:32,496
This real therapist
won't risk upsetting

38
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:36,217
his wonderful new girlfriend by
analyzing her wonderful friends.

39
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,054
No matter how mentally
unbalanced they may be.

40
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,172
I hear you.

41
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,790
I don't think you do.

42
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,726
We just don't want to
burden our little angel

43
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,063
with all kinds of 
gender-specific expectations.

44
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:51,766
Boys can do ballet;
girls can play football.

45
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,576
Hell, the Green Bay
Packers have been

46
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,801
proving that for years.

47
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,491
That would've gotten
a big laugh at a sports bar.

48
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:02,493
Well, I say define
gender roles early.

49
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,745
All the other girls
got a pretty dress

50
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:07,365
and a cake when
they turned 14.

51
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,666
Me...

52
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:10,918
I want to go home, Daddy!

53
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,755
That direction is
nothing but wolves.

54
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:20,511
And 40 kilometers that way
is the mining town of Smithers.

55
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:23,330
I'd take my chances
with the wolves.

56
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,552
I'll see you in three days.

57
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:31,305
Well, wait, wh-what
am I supposed to eat?

58
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:34,358
Hey, you've got a knife,
the forest is full of animals--

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,143
what do you want, a buffet?

60
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:38,062
Papa...!

61
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:41,232
Happy birthday, son...!

62
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:45,069
Got any thoughts
on that, Doc?

63
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,938
If you guys think I'm going near
that, <i>you're</i> crazy.

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,907
Why'd you
emphasize "you're"?

65
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,184
No reason.
You're pretty.

68
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:07,072
By the way, do you guys want
to come over tomorrow night

69
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,297
for sangria and tapas?

70
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,311
<i>Si. Muchas gracias.</i>
That sounds awesome.

71
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,929
Great. We're also
gonna paint the nursery.

72
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:14,815
Oh, and a quick update
on the sangria and tapas--

73
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:16,484
that's cancelled.
Mmm...

74
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:17,518
Guess what smooth
son of a bitch

75
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,220
just picked up
a girl at the bar?

76
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:22,156
Barney, you're cheating
on Nora already?

77
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,591
No, guys, it's <i>me.</i>

78
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,392
Janet McIntyre.

79
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:26,577
Struck up a conversation
at the bar

80
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,662
while ordering, she guessed
bread right away,

81
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:31,056
we laughed, it was
a thing, boom, going

82
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:32,230
out tomorrow night.

83
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:35,669
- So, she said yes just like that?
- Just like that.

84
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,859
BARNEY/ROBIN: There's
something wrong with her.

85
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,084
No, no, no, no.

86
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:39,406
Stop it. They
always do this.

87
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:41,625
Every time I go
on a first date,

88
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,961
they snap right into
research mode.

89
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:45,429
<i>It started by accident.</i>

90
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:47,882
(phone rings)
Ooh.

91
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,100
Hello?

92
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:52,303
Ted, we did a little
Internet research

93
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:53,604
on your Mia Plumley.

94
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:54,822
BARNEY:
We just sent you

95
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,223
a picture of her
from six months ago.

96
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,209
I don't understand--
is Mia standing behind

97
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:01,612
this morbidly obese wo...
(gasps) Oh, my God!

98
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:04,097
They had cookies and cream.

99
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,283
And what you were saying
about how women feel

100
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,769
they have to starve themselves
makes so much sense.

101
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:12,122
Ooh, hot dogs. Score!

102
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,325
<i>After that, background checks</i>

103
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:17,244
<i>became standard</i>
<i>operating procedure.</i>

104
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:19,330
The date with Nadine went great.

105
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,215
Unless you guys found something.

106
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,800
Are you sitting down?

107
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,785
No.

108
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:30,591
She's wanted in Florida
on crystal meth charges.

109
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:33,511
She breeds pit bulls
for dog fighting.

110
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,346
- Also, the FBI...
- What's this link?

111
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,398
Oh, she also writes
online movie reviews.

112
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,467
Anyway, she's still married to
a death row inmate convicted...

113
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:43,470
She gave <i>Annie Hall</i>
two out of ten stars?

114
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:45,773
(gasps)
"Slow and overrated"?

115
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,325
Really? <i>That's</i>
your takeaway?

116
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,494
It's the Wood Man at
the height of his powers.

117
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,447
The way he broke the fourth wall
by talking directly to camera?

118
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:55,332
People have been
ripping that off ever since.

119
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:58,953
Can you believe this guy?

120
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,421
Paula Vincenzo.

121
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:01,872
She's in the bathroom.

122
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:02,823
What's wrong with her?

123
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,792
Total psycho.
Her Facebook wall

124
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,995
has a link to a site about
dating inanimate objects.

125
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,997
For most of last year,
she was engaged...

126
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,349
to a mini fridge.
And there's pictures:

127
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:14,385
her and the mini
fridge on a hike,

128
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,437
her and the mini fridge
in wine country,

129
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,222
here's the mini fridge
meeting her parents...

130
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,974
Run like the wind.

131
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,226
(footsteps approaching)

132
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:25,563
So... want to go
back to my place?

133
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,615
Yeah, all right.

134
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:31,297
Well, thanks to us,
you ran screaming from

135
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:32,522
that freak show, right?

136
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,872
- Absolutely.
- Cuckoo!

137
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:38,075
So what's the problem?

138
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:39,126
You need us.

139
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:40,360
No, I don't, okay?

140
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:41,845
I don't want a
background check.

141
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,914
I want adventure
and excitement.

142
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,332
Look, if it's
a choice

143
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,184
between mystery
and history,

144
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,219
I want mystery.

145
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,621
In fact...

146
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:52,222
Ted, I wouldn't...

147
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:54,391
Uh, Janet.

148
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:56,594
I have a theory.
People don't get the chance

149
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,862
to just discover
each other anymore, so...

150
00:05:58,864 --> 00:05:59,897
here's my idea.

151
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,315
Before we go out tomorrow,

152
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:04,068
let's not do any prior
Internet research on each other.

153
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,637
It sounds like I'm hiding something
horrible, doesn't it?

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,105
I'm pretty sure
you're a serial killer.

155
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:09,389
I'm not. I'm not.

156
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,408
It's just, you know, like,
when my parents met,

157
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,393
they didn't have the Internet--
they just went out

158
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,279
on a blind date
and fell in love.

159
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,164
That's nice.
And they're still together?

160
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,248
Right up to the divorce.

161
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,335
The point is, I'd love
to get to know you

162
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,637
in person, not on my computer.

163
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,589
I like that.
What started out

164
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,008
sounding really creepy
turned out really sweet.

165
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,178
That's kind of my move.
(laughs)

166
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,630
And she was

167
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:34,832
on board with the whole
"no Internet" thing?

168
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,800
She loved it.

169
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:38,936
The bitch is
hiding something.

170
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:40,804
The bitch is totally
hiding something.

171
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,449
Hey, Ted, before you leave--

172
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:49,268
is Janet McIntyre
M-A-C or M-C?

173
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,304
For the last time,
I don't want to know

174
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,905
anything about her
before the date.

175
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,825
You might want to see this,
Ted-- naked pictures.

176
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,660
That's not Janet.

177
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:59,445
Who, now?

178
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:01,214
Seriously...

179
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:04,333
if you guys respect
me as a friend...

180
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:05,885
stop looking.

181
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,725
Well, Ted was pretty
clear there, so...

182
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:13,959
let's shut those laptops

183
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,462
and go help Lily and Marshall,
just like we promised.

184
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:17,930
Let's leave

185
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:21,484
the laptops here
and go paint that baby room.

186
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:24,837
Without laptops.

187
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,489
Or bring the laptops.
Either way.

188
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:28,974
This is exciting.

189
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:30,476
I give you...

190
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,329
the color our child
will grow up with.

191
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,582
Yellow, like the sun.

192
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,318
Or daughter.
Pun snuggle.

193
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,206
Oh, God, this room's about
to get its first spit-up.

194
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,341
Just open the envelope already!

195
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,593
Kevin, will you please
tell Barney that it is

196
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,429
perfectly normal for us to want
to preserve the mystery.

197
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,932
I'm not here to analyze; I'm
here to win boyfriend points.

198
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,885
By the way, you all
look great, especially Robin.

199
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:58,020
Come on, if you don't
know the gender,

200
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:00,556
you're gonna get generic crap
at the baby shower.

201
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,441
But if you do know the gender,

202
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:05,311
you'll get, oh,
I don't know, this!

203
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,863
Marshall! Lights!

204
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,699
Okay.

205
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:11,367
(dance music playing)

206
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:14,303
BARNEY: When little Jack's
not turning double plays,

207
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:16,088
he's turning heads with this

208
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,140
home run of an outfit!

209
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:20,159
And if it's a little girl...

210
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:23,696
This royal ensemble
may leave <i>you</i> speechless,

211
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:25,331
but it's sure to make
little Sally say,

212
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,551
"I wuv you, Mommy,
and I wuv my dress,

213
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:32,205
and I would love
to see you in the shower."

214
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,557
Sorry, I kind of fell out of
character in that last part.

215
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,577
But if you don't
know the gender...

216
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:41,097
Little Fran is sure to be
the pariah of the playground

217
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,367
in this hermaphroditic
burlap sack.

218
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,469
♪ ♪

219
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:47,937
Marshall! Lights!

220
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:51,574
Barney,

221
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,026
you don't really care abo'.

222
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:54,777
No. You just

223
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:55,761
can't stand

224
00:08:55,763 --> 00:08:57,330
not knowing something.

225
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,282
That's ridiculous!

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Marshall, will you...

227
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,518
will you hold
these for a second?

228
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,619
Yeah, sure. Why?

229
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,454
Because I gots to know!

230
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,506
Oh, Barney, no!
Help! Get him off of me!

231
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,126
(all shouting) Everybody hold it!
Hold it!

232
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:13,212
I found Janet McIntyre,
who's been widowed three times.

233
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,298
She's obviously
killing her husbands!

234
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,934
Oh, my God!

235
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,552
They're six minutes
into the date.

236
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:21,887
Ted's probably already told her
that he loves her!

237
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,439
We've got to get down there!

238
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:25,424
(all shouting)

239
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:27,226
Nobody's going anywhere!

240
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,260
Why?!

241
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,779
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, at that moment,</i>

242
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,764
<i>Kevin thought back</i>
<i>to his earlier rule...</i>

243
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:34,116
This real therapist
won't risk

244
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:36,268
upsetting his wonderful
new girlfriend

245
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,437
by analyzing her
wonderful friends.

246
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,139
<i>...and threw it out the window.</i>

247
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,375
You're all the most
codependent, incestuous,

248
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,710
controlling group of
people I've ever met!

249
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:49,498
By the way, you all look
great, especially Robin.

250
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,617
Oh, mm-mm.

251
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,255
This is so great.

252
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,123
Right? See, if we'd
researched each other,

253
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,226
we'd both be secretly
steering the conversation

254
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,560
one way or the other.

255
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:02,979
But this is
more exciting, right?

256
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:04,096
Way more exciting.

257
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,148
I mean, we can talk
about anything we want.

258
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,484
Anything. (laughs)

259
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:11,270
(mellow jazz playing)

260
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,971
So...

261
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,192
...how was the traffic
getting here?

262
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:18,244
You picked me up
at my apartment.

263
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:20,696
I certainly did.

264
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,199
TED:
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

265
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,984
<i>I've lost the ability to talk</i>
<i>to girls without the Internet.</i>

266
00:10:25,986 --> 00:10:28,421
<i>My brain is</i>
<i>completely shutting down.</i>

267
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:30,989
So, are you folks gonna have
dinner or just drinks?

268
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:32,291
(laughing)

269
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:33,992
I-I don't know.

270
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:37,296
What the hell
was that, Kevin?

271
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:38,514
We're all crazy just because

272
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,016
I'm looking up some stuff
on the Internet,

273
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:42,000
and Barney wants
to know the baby's gender?

274
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:44,603
Well, to be honest,

275
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,772
I noticed some
other disturbing...

276
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:49,508
Never mind.

277
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,893
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

278
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:52,528
I gots to know!

279
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,864
Okay, last night alone...

280
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:57,283
When-When are you coming back?

281
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:59,702
Because I miss you, silly!

282
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,456
Wait, who's he talking to?

283
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,624
Shh, I'll be back soon.

284
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,526
Yeah, you want me
to bring you a pretzel?

285
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,945
(ding)

286
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:12,298
Ted's texting me
from the bathroom.

287
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,416
(laughter)

288
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,501
ALL: Oh.

289
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,669
I don't get it.

290
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,888
- It's just a "C" with an apostrophe.
- Oh.

291
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,922
ROBIN:
Oh, yeah.

292
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,341
Sometimes when one
of us is on the can,

293
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:24,894
we'll, uh, sneak a peek
and then text each other,

294
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,896
you know.

295
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:30,549
Symbols to describe what your
bowel movement looks like?

296
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,050
(laughter)

297
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:35,938
This morning,
I took an ampersand.

298
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,556
Last summer,
I dropped a deuce

299
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,825
that actually looked
like the number two!

300
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:42,528
(ding)

301
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,664
When you worked
late Wednesday,

302
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,835
I... I got
lonely and...

303
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:53,071
I watched <i>Survivor</i>
without you.

304
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:55,074
(ding)

305
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,176
Practically the only unhealthy
behavior I didn't see

306
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:59,795
from you people
was physical violence.

307
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:02,431
(grunting)

308
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,434
(grunting)

309
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,387
Yeah.

310
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:09,805
At least we don't do that.

311
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,224
And to top it off,

312
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:14,059
all the meddling
in Ted's love life,

313
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:15,427
not to mention Lily's pregnancy?

314
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,764
It all strikes me as
just deeply dysfunctional.

315
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,951
So what you're saying is,
we're fine?

316
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,987
(ding)

317
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,656
So, while this font is often

318
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,625
mistaken for Helvetica,

319
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:33,078
the fact is...

320
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,881
it's Helvetica Bold.

321
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,617
<i>I can actually hear the sound</i>

322
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:41,353
<i>of her vagina being boarded up.</i>

323
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,557
I got to be honest, Janet.

324
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,643
First of all...
this is Times New Roman.

325
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:49,962
Second, I'm having trouble

326
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,931
coming up with things
to talk about.

327
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,799
You? I'm sitting here thinking,

328
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,019
"Damn it, I wish I had something
as good as that font thing.

329
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,487
That's gold."

330
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:00,523
Guys, I'm so sorry
I said anything.

331
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:04,109
Um, you basically called
my friends mentally ill.

332
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,612
Yeah, you think some lame
apology will fix that?

333
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:09,331
What if I just paint the rest
of the room by myself?

334
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,750
ROBIN, LILY & MARSHALL:
Apology accepted.

335
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,118
Okay, let's do this.

336
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,753
Let-Let's find out
each other's likes and dislikes.

337
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,955
Start with something
totally random.

338
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,540
Like, um, oh, I don't know.

339
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,325
Are you a fan of--
I don't know--

340
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,344
<i>Annie Hall?</i>

341
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:25,297
I'm guessing that's not random
at all, and you use that movie

342
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:27,216
to test whether a girl is cool?

343
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:28,934
No, it's-it's the first movie
that popped into...

344
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:30,636
I love <i>Annie Hall.</i>
Oh, thank God you're cool.

345
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:32,471
NARRATOR:
<i>But just as things started</i>

346
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,523
<i>to go well</i>
<i>with Janet McIntyre...</i>

347
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,809
Whoa. I just found
Janet McIntyre.

348
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,028
<i>The</i> Janet McIntyre.

349
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:49,071
BOTH:
Sweet... mother... of God!

350
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,289
(laughs)

351
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,191
(phone chimes)

352
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:56,996
Uh, well, I got to
run to the restroom.

353
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:59,081
No internet, Mister.

354
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,866
If you find out my deep, dark
secret, I'll have to kill you.

355
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:02,418
It's just my friends
checking up on me.

356
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
I'll politely let them know
we're having a lovely time.

357
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:05,871
Okay.

358
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:09,758
Ted says, "I'm not clicking on
the link, so leave me alone."

359
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,428
And then either texted me a
bunch of symbols for profanity,

360
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,545
or got food poisoning

361
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,547
and dropped the weirdest deuce
of all time.

362
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,650
You guys have
to see this.

363
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:19,485
No. We're with
Ted on this.

364
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,386
We don't want to
find out about Janet,

365
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,056
just like we don't want to
find out about the baby.

366
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:25,407
Because we like mystery,

367
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:27,493
whether it's the hairy
majesty of Bigfoot,

368
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:30,529
or the bloodsucking ferocity
of the Chupacabra,

369
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:32,364
or the gender
of our little miracle.

370
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,699
Thanks for putting
those together

371
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,067
in the same
sentence, sweetie.

372
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:36,418
Mm.

373
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,121
Look, if you guys don't want
to know, how about this?

374
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:41,707
Let me look,
and I won't tell you.

375
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,509
Absolutely not.
Fine.

376
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:44,343
(gasping)

377
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:45,544
Baby, if it will shut him up,

378
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:46,629
what's the harm?

379
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,683
Can I...?

380
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:53,052
(muttering)

381
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:55,804
(both giggling)

382
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:57,806
This may have been a mistake.

383
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:59,558
Boy!

384
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,926
Do I like babies!

385
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:02,478
Girl!

386
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:04,113
...friend,

387
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,931
your hair looks
fantastic!

388
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,150
Twins!

389
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,402
was the feel-good movie of 1988.

390
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:13,038
Okay, Barney, hey, it doesn't
matter what you guys say.

391
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,239
We're not gonna cave.

392
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,574
Yes, we are!

393
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,559
Oh, just open
your eyes.

394
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,045
This gender-neutral
yellow is horrible!

395
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,581
We're clearly gonna paint
over the whole thing!

396
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,616
That's what you want to hear.

397
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,051
I gots to know!

398
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,720
Yeah.

399
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:30,139
"It's a..."

400
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,057
It's a...

401
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,726
Where is the rest
of the card?

402
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,477
I ripped it in half.

403
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,462
I knew you'd be
desperate to see it,

404
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:38,764
and I'll give it to you.

405
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:41,934
All you have to do is admit
that mystery is stupid

406
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:45,404
by reading
about Janet McIntyre.

407
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,139
This is in no way
emotional extortion.

408
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,524
You guys are great.

409
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,659
Fine, we'll look
at your laptop.

410
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:54,446
BOTH:
Sweet...

411
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:57,082
mother... of God.

412
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,336
I can't really see
the computer screen.

413
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,371
It just went down
the wrong pipe.

414
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,707
(phone chimes)

415
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,759
TED:
<i>Whoa.</i>

416
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:09,044
<i>If Lily and Marshall want me</i>
<i>to click on it,</i>

417
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,847
<i>maybe Janet really does have</i>
<i>a deep, dark secret.</i>

418
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,266
What's going on?

419
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:15,434
I'm a prostitute.

420
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,352
You didn't think I was

421
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,469
actually into you, did you?

422
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,887
Sort of.

423
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,973
(laughter)

424
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:23,175
TED:
<i>Get it together, Mosby.</i>

425
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:27,079
Oh.

426
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:28,480
(sighs)

427
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:30,348
You don't buy beer,
you rent it.

428
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,784
Am I right?

429
00:16:31,786 --> 00:16:33,202
This is the
men's room.

430
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,787
I know.

431
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:35,754
I'm a dude.

432
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:38,857
(gasps)

433
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:45,130
(sighs)

434
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,133
Listen, there's something
you should know.

435
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:50,386
I lied.

436
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,221
I only kind of liked <i>Annie Hall.</i>

437
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,422
(gasps)

438
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:59,261
TED:
<i>I gots to know!</i>

439
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,717
Sweet...

440
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:08,437
mother... of God.

441
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:21,695
Hey.

442
00:17:21,752 --> 00:17:23,887
(sighs)

443
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,923
Ted, are you okay?
You look freaked out.

444
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,559
I'm not freaked out.

445
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,995
NARRATOR:
<i>I was freaked out. Why?</i>

446
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,964
<i>'Cause I had just discovered</i>
<i>that Janet McIntyre was...</i>

447
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:37,200
<i>amazing!</i>

448
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:02,458
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>the wall went up.</i>

449
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
Okay, he looked at
Janet McIntyre's

450
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:06,329
Internet
extravaganza.

451
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,348
Here's the other half
of the card.

452
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:16,139
Wait. Should we
do this? I...

453
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,474
I don't know.
I mean, my soul says no,

454
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,027
but these hideous
yellow walls scream yes.

455
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:23,813
Should I just stop, or...?

456
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,316
Sweet mother of God!

457
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:29,702
A dog in Ottawa ran all the way
to Saskatoon!

458
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,854
What?

459
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,122
We figured out the Janet thing.

460
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:34,457
I'm catching up on Canada.

461
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,293
(gasps)

462
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,862
You're with me on this, right?

463
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:42,698
Otherwise, I can go down,
and I can get the card.

464
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,466
Absolutely.

465
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:45,418
Oh, thank you.

466
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:49,756
NARRATOR: <i>And so the gender</i>
<i>remained a secret,</i>

467
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:53,176
<i>but Janet McIntyre's life</i>
<i>no longer was.</i>

468
00:18:53,178 --> 00:18:55,144
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

469
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,729
Ted, what's going on?

470
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,265
Nothing.

471
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,550
Did I mention
that I'm the youngest architect

472
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,987
in New York history
to have a skyscraper built?

473
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,721
Oh.
So, I'm not quite

474
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:08,241
as far beneath you
as you might think.

475
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:10,276
Why would I think that?

476
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:12,695
No reason, but this one time
in sixth grade,

477
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,665
I saw a raccoon trapped
in a gutter, and I told my dad,

478
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,533
and the firemen came
and got it out,

479
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:20,503
so it's not like I pulled a baby
from a creek or anything,

480
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:21,754
but at least
I didn't ignore it

481
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:24,674
and keep lighting bugs on fire
with my magnifying glass.

482
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:26,793
We had one promise,
and you broke it.

483
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,661
What are you talking about?

484
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:30,579
You looked me up, and now
you find me intimidating.

485
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:32,849
Why-Why would I find you
intimidating, okay?

486
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:35,084
It's not like
I donated a kidney,

487
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,352
but I donated blood once,

488
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:37,586
although I wound up fainting,

489
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,722
and they had to put it
all back in.

490
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,941
(sighs)
I was so excited about this.

491
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:45,228
But now you're just a blubbering
idiot like the rest of them.

492
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,696
No, I ain't!

493
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:49,782
I mean, no, I never do
that thing you says.

494
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:50,950
(sighs)

495
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:52,652
What I mean is,
you gooder than me

496
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:55,705
no make difference!

497
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:58,124
<i>And that's that.</i>

498
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,493
I wish to God I'd never
clicked on that link.

499
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:01,911
I'm sorry, Ted.

500
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:03,779
We were just
trying to help.

501
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:06,165
I said it was meddling
and manipulative,

502
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,167
but Kevin insisted we butt in.

503
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,386
(ding)

504
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,256
No, it's my fault.

505
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,807
I never should have looked.

506
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,677
In the battle
of mystery versus history,

507
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,645
it's best
not to know.

508
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:22,315
Lily Pad?

509
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:23,850
What?

510
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:26,235
We're having a boy.

511
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,489
We're having a boy.

512
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,806
We're having a boy!
You're having a boy!

513
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:32,859
We're having a...
we're having a boy.

514
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,360
We're having a boy.
(laughter)

515
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:35,695
We're having
a boy.

516
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:38,081
I'll go buy
some blue paint.

517
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,551
It needs sharpening.

518
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:54,138
You see? I told you three days
would go by in no time.

519
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,806
Phineas, take us up!

520
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:57,224
Well, in case
you were wondering,

521
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,527
it rained the entire time
I was in the Caribbean.

522
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,708
Thank you for asking.
