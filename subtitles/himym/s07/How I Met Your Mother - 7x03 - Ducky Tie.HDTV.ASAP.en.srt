of my new ducky tie?

Pretty cute, right?

3
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:07,860
And not that much more expensive
than a regular tie.

4
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:09,094
Hmm.

5
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:10,029
A ducky tie?

Any guesses?

00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,156
- Stella.
- Zoe.

20
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,791
- Karen?
- The girl who beat you up.

21
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,192
The girl who ruined
a photo with Slash!

The girl who made you get
the butterfly tattoo?

23

You make it sound
like I've dated

24

a series of Stieg Larrson
novels.

25
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,949

a little more specific.

Instead of the obligatory

really, really sorry.

- Not really.

It was a little awkward.

Lucky for you, the cavalry rode
in to smooth things over.

95
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:57,322
So, uh...

96
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:59,624

No, no. Why would that be weird?

110
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,273
I mean, if you hung out
every day, that would...

111
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,474
We do.

112
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:34,025
...still not be weird.

00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,033

it means something.

179
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:58,670
I bet Ted showed Victoria
the shrimp in his pocket.

180
00:06:58,672 --> 00:07:00,005
Shrimp? Really?

181
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,573
Okay, I'll do all

182
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:03,625
those things. You just name
the time and the place.

183
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,510
Okay, right here
after we eat.

184
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,628
And what do I get if I do?

185
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,596
What do you want?

186
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:08,480
I want to touch Lily's boobs.

187
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:09,848
Deal!

188
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,798
Hey, sweetie?

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,417
Yeah, I heard.

190
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,571
Okay, Barney, you want
to make this real?

191
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:17,989
Let's make this real.

192
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,909
Terms: If you can do
all that stuff

193
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,193
that Marshall just listed off,

194
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:23,978
I will let
you touch one boob.

195
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,812
Both boobs.

196
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:25,647
Just one.

197
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,448
Touch and squeeze.

198
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,115
Just touch.

199
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:28,083
Touch and motorboat.

200
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:28,783
Just touch.

201
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:29,701
- Honka honka?
- Barney.

202
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:30,835
Just touch.
Just touch.

203
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,504
For one hour.
For one second.

204
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:33,821
20 minutes, both boobs.

205
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,173
Thirty seconds, one boob.

206
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:37,542
Four minutes, both boobs,
three squeezes.

207
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,657
One minute, both boobs, 
one squeeze.

208
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:40,442
Deal!

209
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:43,665
But... if you can't do
everything

210
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,100
and I mean everything,

211
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:49,437
then you have to wear
Marshall's ducky tie...

212
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,072
for one year.

213
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:53,825
BOTH: Ooh...

214
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:55,994
Deal.

215
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,517
So you get to the bakery.

216
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,402
We get to the bakery.

217
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:06,488
Well, this is great.

218
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,156
You know what else
is getting clean

219
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:09,541
along with this
cupcake tray?

220
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:11,192
My conscience.

221
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:13,378
You got anything else
you need to atone for?

222
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,696
My oven needs cleaning.

223
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,415
Un, no, nothing else.

224
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,018
Not yet anyway.

225
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:24,422
♪ Bang, bang, bangity-bang,
said a bang-bang-bangity. ♪

226
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:26,274
I'm getting married.

227
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:30,695
Bang.

228
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,546
Baby, I think I got yours.
This one has no booze.

229
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:39,412
Oh, no, that's mine.

230
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:40,714
Yeah, I don't know

231
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:43,032
why people think
that Mai Tais need booze.

232
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,384
I've been drinking virgins
all night,

233
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:45,385
and they're delicious.

234
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:47,387
Yeah, well, enjoy
your Mai Tai

235
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:52,225
because as of tomorrow night,
you'll be wearing my tie.

236
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:54,127
Our future child
is so lucky.

237
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,846
Wait. You're not drunk?

238
00:08:56,848 --> 00:09:00,934
Huh. I guess not.

239
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:02,352
(gasps) It's a hustle!

240
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:03,436
We gettin' hustled!

241
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:05,355
Oh, this stinks.

242
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:06,856
This stinks to holy hell!

243
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,575
He's gonna win the bet!

244
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:11,828
Baby, come on. Even if he was
sober as a nun,

245
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,063
there's no way he could do what
these guys do.

246
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:18,401
Exactly. I mean, to learn
the trademark secrets

247
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:19,536
of Shinjitsu hibachi cooking,

248
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:22,572
one would have to go
all the way...

249
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:24,741
to Hoboken, New Jersey.

250
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:27,744
Yeah, they have a school there.

251
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,879
It's a six-month course.
They teach you everything.

252
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:30,964
How do you know that?

253
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,433
Maybe I looked it up
on my phone just now.

254
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:37,137
Then again, maybe not.

255
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:44,944
So Victoria's getting married.

256
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,596
She's getting married.

257
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:49,766
I'm sorry. I should have
told you that way earlier.

258
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,117
No, no, it's fine.

259
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,986
You thought something
was gonna happen.

260
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,537
Like one percent.

261
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,539
Maybe slap on a ring next time.

262
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,608
Well, the problem is,
he hasn't asked me yet.

263
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,277
I found the ring in a box
in his sock drawer.

264
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,714
Wow! Guy's got a whole drawer
just for socks?

265
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:06,299
Must be nice.

266
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,919
So when's Money Bags
popping the question?

267
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:11,221
I'm pretty sure tomorrow.

268
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:12,388
He's taking me out

269
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,957
to a really nice restaurant out
in the Hamptons.

270
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,810
It's right on the water,

271
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:21,631
so afterwards we'll take a walk
on the beach in the moonlight.

272
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,466
You should probably go.

273
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,535
I don't know.
It sounds pretty intimate.

274
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,786
(dry chuckle)

275
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:29,972
I'm serious. I feel
like I misled you.

276
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:34,310
Madam, I came here
to wash your dishes.

277
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:35,612
Nothing more.

278
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,314
- Whoa! What was that!?
- What was what?

279
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:41,000
This guy and Barney
just shared a look!

280
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:42,285
Do you know him?

281
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,041
(gasps) They did it again!

282
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,043
This whole thing stinks,
I tells ya!

283
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,494
It stinks!

284
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:55,682
Lily, are you really suggesting
that Barney spent six months

285
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:58,101
commuting back and forth
to Hoboken

286
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,587
to learn a signature cooking
style of a restaurant

287
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:03,156
he doesn't even like
so he could win a bet

288
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:04,858
he hadn't even made yet?

289
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Yeah, the whole thing stinks.

290
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:09,112
No, it's not possible, okay?

291
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:11,180
I was the one who said
let's go to Shinjitsu...

292
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:12,782
(Barney sneezes)
Bless you.

293
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,951
How could Barney have...

294
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,825
You brilliant bastard.

295
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:23,543
It's all so obvious now.

296
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:25,795
For the past, oh, I don't
know how long, five years,

297
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:27,831
every time I've said,
"Let's go to Shinjitsu""

298
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,915
(sneezes)
Bless you.

299
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:32,051
You've sneezed.

300
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:33,369
Every time.

301
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:34,954
MARSHALL:
<i>And little by little...</i>

302
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,589
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

303
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:38,541
(sneezes)
Bless you. Bless you.

304
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:41,711
<i>...you forged the association</i>
<i>in my brain.</i>

305
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:43,029
So what should we do for dinner?

306
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:44,547
Let's go to Shinjitsu.
(sneezes)

307
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:45,815
Oh, bless you.
Thanks.

308
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:47,734
MARSHALL:
<i>Until eventually...</i>

309
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:50,186
Yes, I know I said that
we'd be back Sunday,

310
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:51,988
but guess what?
We are back now!

311
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,055
Now what on earth...

312
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:54,440
Stop bouncing!
What on earth

313
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:56,225
would make you think that
we'd be okay with this?

314
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:59,012
(sneezes)
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

315
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:00,914
When you were sick
for a week last year,

316
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,199
I had Shinjitsu
like six times.

317
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:05,285
You had the knife skills...

318
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:07,871
you had the trigger...

319
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:11,124
All you needed then was
to want something from me.

320
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:15,178
And then one day... those
somethings came a-busting out.

321
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,297
Wapowng!

322
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,299
I am gonna have
to walk this earth,

323
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,418
knowing Barney has
touched my boobs.

324
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
Yeah. It stays with you.

325
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:27,090
His email reminders don't help.

326
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:28,808
Okay, Lily, this is ridiculous.

327
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,560
If you want to
call the bet off...

328
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:31,778
Great! The bet's off!

329
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,329
Let me finish.

330
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:36,933
Here's the deal: If
you let me just see them--

331
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,118
no touching, just looking--
for one minute...

332
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,653
30 seconds.
For 30 seconds,

333
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:42,104
in a well-lit
photography studio...

334
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:43,907
- In the alley.
- In the alley...

335
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:45,491
then we'll cancel this
entire wager completely.

336
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:46,826
Do we have a deal?

337
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:49,746
I totally think you
should take the deal.

338
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:51,280
MARSHALL:
I don't think we have a choice.

339
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:52,465
Go on, take the deal.

340
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,584
I'll... think about it.

341
00:12:57,638 --> 00:12:59,005
So you're doing the dishes...

342
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,340
I'm doing the dishes.

343
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,392
All done.

344
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:03,676
Congratulations.

345
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:07,129
Your karmic slate is
clean and lemony fresh.

346
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:09,131
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

347
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,484
See, now I can start anew,

348
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:14,354
and hopefully end up as
happy as you and, uh...

349
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:15,605
Sorry, what's his name?

350
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,657
- Whose name?
- Your fiancé-to-be.

351
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,275
Oh! His name is Klaus.

352
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:21,394
- Klaus.
- Klaus.

353
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:22,645
German name.

354
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:25,381
- Yeah, German guy.
- Hmm.

355
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,867
When you were
living in Germany,

356
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:30,003
and we were doing the whole
long-distance thing...

357
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,754
wasn't there a Klaus
in your class?

358
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:33,039
There was a Klaus in my class.

359
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,324
- And you and Klaus were close.
- Not that close.

360
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:37,593
Yes, yes, you and the Klaus from
your class were quite close.

361
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:38,678
Kind of close.

362
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,813
- Was that your Klaus?
- My Klaus?

363
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:42,115
- In your class.
- In my class?

364
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,417
Is your Klaus the kind of
close Klaus from your class?

365
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:45,852
Yes.

366
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:50,172
You didn't cheat on me
with Klaus, did you?

367
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,508
- No. No, I did not.
- Mm.

368
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,860
Okay, new question.

369
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:56,062
After we broke up,
how long were you single

370
00:13:56,064 --> 00:13:58,314
before you and Klaus
started dating?

371
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:02,368
Oh, how long... um, well,
we broke up in April, so...

372
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,203
a day and a half.

373
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:08,574
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me!

374
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,792
I'm sorry.

375
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,961
So I've spent the last
six years feeling like

376
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:15,698
I completely betrayed you,
when in truth, you...

377
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,884
No, you know what?

378
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:21,387
(gasps)

379
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:22,872
Okay. Fine.

380
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,641
Just let yourself off the hook
on a technicality!

381
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:27,844
Forget the fact that
you did cheat on me!

382
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:31,597
Forget it? I will
never forget it. Okay?

383
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,982
I will never stop regretting it,

384
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,851
because what we had
meant that much to me!

385
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:37,219
I just... I wish it had meant
something to you, too.

386
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:38,554
Are you kidding?

387
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:40,623
- I loved you!
- Did you?

388
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,108
Yes.

389
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,730
We had such an amazing
time together.

390
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:48,915
Do you remember that night

391
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,400
we found that crazy
videotape of Barney?

392
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,869
Game night.

393
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,537
We played that ridiculous
game Marshall invented.

394
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,072
- Marshgammon.
- Yeah.

395
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,408
We've played it a few times
since. I still don't get it.

396
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,876
Remember the night we met?

397
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:02,795
I remember you not
letting me kiss you.

398
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:04,414
Remember why?

399
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,432
You had this ridiculous idea

400
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:08,351
that the moment leading
up to the kiss...

401
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:09,302
The drum roll.

402
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:11,637
...is as good as
the kiss itself.

403
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,222
Isn't it?

404
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:15,141
Well, it's certainly
more innocent.

405
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:16,526
It's completely harmless.

406
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:18,394
Completely.

407
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:33,468
- Oh, my God!
- Oh no.

408
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,987
No, no-no-no-no-no.

409
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,139
- I should not have done that.
- No, that was me.

410
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:40,108
I let you come wash my dishes!

411
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,777
I said my "oven"
needed "cleaning"!

412
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,845
I invited you into a porno!

413
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,197
No.

414
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,065
You were right. This is fate.

415
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:49,067
I needed to see
you one more time

416
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:50,903
in order to know
for sure about Klaus.

417
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:52,704
And...?

418
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:55,240
And...

419
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:59,695
I have a bus to catch.

420
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,717
Fine, you can see my boobs!

421
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,718
To the alley!

422
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,338
This seems unfair.

423
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,673
I mean, I get that
I'm the only person

424
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:13,058
not allowed to see this, but...

425
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,644
it just, it-it seems unfair.

426
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,095
Come on, Lily, hurry up.

427
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:18,647
Guys...

428
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:21,767
You know, I'm all for honoring a
bet, but who invited Takumi?

429
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:24,603
Sorry, bro.
I tried.

430
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:26,822
(speaking Japanese)

431
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,393
What's going on?
What am I missing?

432
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:33,495
Are they out yet?
What do they look like?

433
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:34,830
Look, I don't want to know!

434
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:36,231
Just tell me the kind of coin.

435
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:39,001
Do you know how long
30 seconds is?

436
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:42,254
It's going to be five seconds of...
(gasps excitedly)

437
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:44,840
followed by 25 seconds of....
(awkward grunt)

438
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:48,293
I mean, yes,
seeing Lily's boobs

439
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:50,796
is all you've ever
wanted, but come on.

440
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,799
All he's ever wanted...

441
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,217
Lily, stop!

442
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:57,352
Don't you see?

443
00:16:57,354 --> 00:17:00,355
This was his plan all along!

444
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:03,892
He let us think he knows how
to do all this Shinjitsu stuff,

445
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,927
just so he could
get you out here

446
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:08,063
whipping out your milk-makers!

447
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:10,899
You son of a bitch!

448
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,701
The bet is back on!

449
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:15,770
Nice try, Barney!

450
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:17,739
Nice try.

451
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:19,941
(laughing loudly)

452
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,286
(sizzling)

453
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:33,939
Maybe I was wrong.

454
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:36,341
Well, I guess that's everything
you asked me to do, is it not?

455
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:38,760
Oh, wait! The shrimp
in the pocket.

456
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,012
A modern classic.

457
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:41,046
And now...

458
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:43,899
for one minute on second base...

459
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:46,818
with a firm yet
sensual squeeze...

460
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,453
Nothing can stop him now.

461
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:50,122
One thing can.

462
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:51,490
Make that two things.

463
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:14,179
No!!

464
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:17,683
Yeah!
Yeah!

465
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:19,551
So you take her to the bus...

466
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:21,219
I take her to the bus.

467
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,106
Well, this feels familiar.

468
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:27,309
You leaving, me kind of
wanting to say, "Don't go""

469
00:18:27,311 --> 00:18:28,694
Little late for that.

470
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,696
Little bit.

471
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:32,647
- Don't go.
- Ted...

472
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,399
I'm sorry. I just...

473
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:36,201
Why didn't I say it then?

474
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:38,954
Why'd I let you
get on that plane?

475
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:41,890
Why didn't I get on it with you?

476
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:45,460
What would our lives be
right now, if we had just...

477
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:47,913
held on?

478
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,365
Would I have still run into
you at this party tonight...

479
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,334
or would we have been
there together?

480
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,503
We'd go home...

481
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:56,872
to our home?

482
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:01,426
You cook. I do the dishes.

483
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:04,146
I'm happy that you're happy.

484
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:07,232
But damn it.

485
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:08,483
What if?

486
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:11,103
Do you really want
to know the answer to that?

487
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:13,271
No.

488
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:16,224
I think it would kill me.

489
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:18,893
Good-bye, Ted.

490
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:32,407
And that was it.

491
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:35,260
Now she's probably engaged.

492
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,581
Maybe it's for the best.

493
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:45,437
All right. Well...

494
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,322
We're gonna duck out.

495
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,109
Sorry to leave you
with the bill.

496
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:55,614
Oh, guys, it's gonna
be a good year.

497
00:19:56,932 --> 00:19:58,150
I'm glad you guys can laugh,

498
00:19:58,152 --> 00:20:00,152
'cause I think I'm gonna
be physically ill.

499
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,736
Coming down with a mallardy?

500
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:03,989
Oh, they look hungry.
There you go.

501
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,624
Here you go.

502
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:08,293
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, there was</i>
<i>one part I left out.</i>

503
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,295
Good-bye, Ted.

504
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,617
Okay, yes.
What's the answer?

505
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:23,141
There is a reason that it didn't
work out between you and me,

506
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:25,093
but it's not Germany.

507
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:27,712
And I'm willing to bet it's the
same reason none of your other

508
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:30,131
relationships in the last
six years have lasted either.

509
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,483
It's Robin.

510
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:33,685
No.

511
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,103
Yes.

512
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:38,106
She is so much bigger
in your world than you realize.

513
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:41,660
And this thing that you're all
doing, you and Barney and Robin,

514
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:44,946
where the three of you hang out
at the bar night in, night out,

515
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,832
like you're all just buddies?

516
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,417
That doesn't work. Trust me.

517
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,419
You-You've got it all wrong.

518
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:53,138
I'm right about this.

519
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,842
Good-bye, Ted.

520
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:03,155
NARRATOR:
And sure enough, <i>she was right.</i>

521
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:05,574
<i>It didn't work;</i>
<i>we just didn't realize it yet.</i>
