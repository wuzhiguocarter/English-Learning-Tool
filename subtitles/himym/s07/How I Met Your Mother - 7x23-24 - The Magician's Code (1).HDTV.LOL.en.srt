00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:09,260
<i>in Atlantic City</i>

4
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:11,929

5
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,847
Baby come...

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,499
Papa gonna be am I...

7
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,718
Hospital must we get now...

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,471
Okay, there's like a four-hour
wait at the valet stand.

9
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:23,524
Plus, we're in no shape to
drive. So, a car's out...

10
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:26,810
Wait, don't worry. We'll take
a cab to the train station.

11
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,295
MAN: Yeah, good luck
getting a cab.

12
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:29,897
It's impossible because
of the big thing.

13
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,066
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, for the life of</i>
<i>me, I can't remember</i>

14
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:34,702

15
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:36,971
SON: <i>Was it</i>

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,325
NARRATOR: <i>No, it was</i>
<i>a porn convention.</i>

17
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:44,311
<i>Sci-fi convention?</i>

18
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,330
<i>Eh, I can't remember.</i>

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,420
We're stuck in Atlantic City!
City of Atlantic stuck in are we.

22
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,785
Okay, Lily,
it's going to be fine.

23
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:12,121
We are not freaking out.
We are not freaking out!

24
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:15,659
I feel calmer already.
Let's get you to the hospital.

25
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,695
Oh, I can't go yet.
I talked to Dr. Sonya.

26
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,530
They won't admit me
until my contractions

27
00:01:19,532 --> 00:01:20,485
are four minutes apart.

28
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,117
Okay, well, if you
don't make it in time,

29
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,235
I have got you covered. When I
was 13, my father caught me

30
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:27,504
kissing a boy, so he sent me
to our family's ranch

31
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:29,840
for foaling season.
Once you see a baby horse

32
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:32,292
erupt through that birth canal,
you stop even touching yourself.

33
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:35,078
Anyway, I had skinny arms,
so I got up there elbow deep.

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,680
I lost this watch
birthing Blacky...

35
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:40,267
Okay, stop it. I am not
a farm animal. (mooing)

36
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:43,253
Oh, there we go.
Easy girl. Sugar cube? (moaning)

37
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,855
Oh, okay.

38
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:46,757
Ah, don't worry, Lil.

39
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,026
Some of us know what
a woman actually needs

40
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,260
at a time like this.

41
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:54,431
(panting) A kick-ass
labor announcement e-mail.

42
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,483
TED: <i>A man,</i>

43
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:57,818

<i>and their best friend,</i>

45
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,805
<i>embark on an</i>

48
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:10,247
You are not sending that
to anyone, ever.

49
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:14,218
So what I need right now is
distraction from the pain.

50
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,886
Just tell me a story.

51
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:17,971
Uh, what story?
I don't care. Anything.

52
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:19,873
How about the worst
cab ride ever?

53
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,675
HOMELESS GUY:
Clean your window for you? - No!

54
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,093
Hey, get off my cab!

55
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:25,512
(grunting)

56
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:27,264
(blows landing)
Oh! Oh, God!

57
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,316
(loud thud)
Oh! Ah!

58
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:31,435
(Ted and Robin gasping)

59
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,136
(both screaming)

60
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:34,605
(screaming)

61
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,907
We are not panicking!
We are not panicking!

62
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,975
Get on all fours;
it widens your hind quarters.

63
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:41,978
Stop it! I am not
a farm animal!

64
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,782
But give me that sugar cube.

65
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:47,668
Okay, listen, I am going to
get you to that hospital

66
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,337
or die trying.
And if I succeed,

67
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,372
I ask only one thing in return.

68
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:55,292
Let me choose
your child's middle name.

69
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:58,045
Because I have thought up the
most awesome name of all time.

70
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,680
What's the middle name?

71
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,331
Wait for it...

72
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,966
I'm waiting.

73
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,184
Wait for it...

74
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,969
I said I'm waiting.

75
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:08,305
Wait for it.
What's the middle name?

76
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,741
No, the middle name is
"Wait For It."

77
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:13,227
Let's say his first name is,
oh, I don't know, Barney.

78
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,764
He'd be Barney
"Wait For It" Eriksen.

79
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,967
How awesome is that?

80
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,753
That is...

81
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:25,706
the coolest...
middle name of all time.

82
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,941
I know!
Okay, listen.

83
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:30,828
I have a plan
to get us to New York.

84
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,831
All we have to do is get our
hands on that motorcycle.

85
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:39,520
And I know just the way
to do it.

86
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,173
(both sigh)

87
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,592
(phone rings)

88
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,543
Here.

89
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:49,179
Oh. Hi, Judy.

90
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,267
Oh, good.
You got the e-mail from Ted.

91
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,770
No, I am not worried my
city hips are too narrow,

92
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:59,106
and-and your grandson's
going to get stuck.

93
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,657
I got to go.

94
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,193
I thought you deleted
that stupid e-mail.

95
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:05,395
Okay, I sent it by accident.

96
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:07,331
She like it?
Yes!

97
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,065
Just keep telling me stories!

98
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:13,921
Okay, okay, I got one for you:
second base with Neil Young.

99
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,839
Um, (chuckles)

100
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:20,711
I don't normally go to, um,
second base and tell,

101
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:25,749
but I just spent
a magical night with Neil Young.

102
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,634
(whispers):
He's still in my room.

103
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,219
Seriously?
Oh, my God.

104
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,021
Be quiet, don't scare him off.

105
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,306
(clears throat)

106
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:33,757
He-Hey...

107
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,445
Robin...
Yeah.

108
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,231
That's not Neil Young.

109
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,268
Oh, God.

110
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,330
(both laughing)

111
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:49,157
Oh, we're busting apple bags?
I can bust apple bags.

112
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,284
Ted, remember when we were
dating and we threw that party

113
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:54,636
and one of those appetizers
just didn't sit right?

114
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,556
Ah... doesn't sound familiar.

115
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:01,626
I call this story "Ted and
the Cuban Sandwich Crisis."

116
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,328
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

117
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,597
ROBIN: <i>Ted came out of that</i>
<i>bathroom looking like</i>

118
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,600
<i>Joe Frazier after</i>
<i>the Thrilla in Manila.</i>

119
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,987
Oh, what is that smell!?

120
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:13,906
Ugh!

121
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:19,111
So I, being a great girlfriend,
<i>tried to help him out.</i>

122
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,700
You guys are all crazy;
I don't smell anything.

123
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:26,785
Anyway, uh, who wants to
go up on the roof?

124
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:27,786
ROBIN: <i>But then...</i>

125
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:31,673
She, who denied it, supplied it.

126
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:35,438
Yeah, must have been that
Cuban sandwich, huh, babe?

127
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,463
(both chuckle)

128
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:38,847
That was not cool, Ted.

129
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,182
Contraction!

130
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:42,301
That wasn't cool, Ted?

131
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:44,103
(grunting): Just keep going
with the stories.

132
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:45,854
I don't even care
if I've heard it before.

133
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:48,690
Just tell me, uh,
"Where Does That Door Go?"

134
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:49,875
Okay.

135
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:53,662
Hey, I've never noticed
that door before.

136
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,900
I wonder where it goes.

137
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,188
Ted.
Ted.

138
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,541
No, no, no, let him...
let him...

139
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:12,347
Wow...

140
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,203
Don't...
No...

141
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,005
Robi....

142
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,897
Oh...

143
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,649
Wow...

144
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,883
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

145
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,318
Dad, oh, good.

146
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,554
Let me guess,
you got Ted's e-mail.

147
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:38,890
I'm on my way, Princess.
Dad, wait, no, not...

148
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:40,075
Damn it, Ted.

149
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:44,279
I was okay with you e-mailing
my aunt, my cousins,

150
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,915
and your cousins, and the guy
that Robin thought was Neil Young.

151
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,869
But my father is the absolute
worst person to have around

152
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,255
in any sort of
medical situation.

153
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:55,073
LILY:
<i>When I was seven, I needed</i>

154
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:56,391
<i>to have my tonsils out.</i>

155
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:58,343
Daddy, I'm scared.

156
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,181
Aw, Princess, I would be too.
I've researched this surgery.

157
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:05,350
Anything can happen.
You could bleed to death...

158
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,936
...you could have your jaw
removed due to infection,

159
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:10,922
and the anesthesia could
suddenly just stop working,

160
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,808
much like your mom's
and my marriage.

161
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,727
(laughing)

162
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,930
You do know that we're
getting a divor...

163
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,783
Don't worry about it. We'll talk
about it after the surgery.

164
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,102
Calm down, girl.
(panting)

165
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,705
Okay, for the last time,
I am not...

166
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,541
Actually, keep going.

167
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:32,578
Okay, I admit the whole "win a
motorcycle plan" was stupid.

168
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,932
Especially because we've been
playing on the wrong machine.

169
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:39,468
BARNEY: New plan:

170
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,087
Meet me at the entrance

Hop on, Marshall.
Tonight, we ride!

173

You won that?

174
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,933
Not exactly. You see, I...

180

<i>But he still considers</i>

181

I miss him.

183

Got it.
"The Tale of the Cursed Pants."

184
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,547
Hey, guys. (chuckles)

185
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:46,383
So, I'm starting worry
about these pants.

186
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:47,434
Starting to?

187
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:49,302
No, ever since I got them,
terrible things

188
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,221
have been happening to me:
I stubbed my toe,

189
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,506
I missed my train...
You put on the pants.

190
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,509
(all chuckle) And then the lady at the thrift
store said that for years,

191
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,194
no one so much as tried them on.
Can you believe that?

192
00:08:58,219 --> 00:08:59,814
Yes.

193
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,481
You know what this means?

194
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,801
These pants are cursed.

195
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:08,688
What's this in the pocket?

196
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,293
A clue.

197

<i>the writing translated.</i>

198
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:18,965

Dry cleaning, $21.50.

202
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:46,493
I remember that suit.
He looked like

203
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,329
a little kid's imaginary friend.
(chuckles)

204
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,231

218
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:45,418
No!!

219
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,053
What's up, bro?

220
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,789
Wait, how did you...
with the security?

221
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,124
I'll explain.

Go ahead, call 'em.

225

But first, can you show me
the rule that says you can't

226

I ran into this guy.

Plus, here's the best part.

This Quinn thing is probably
done, so I'm basically single.

236
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:34,885
He said the bus is full of
hot college seniors.

237
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,854
Okay, maybe he didn't
say "college."

238
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:39,472
Or "hot."

239
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:41,892

242

Salt lick?

243
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,430
Just finish the door story!

244
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:03,213
Oh, wow.

245
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:08,084
I don't like this.

246
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,220

Buffalo.

260

What do you mean
I can't have an epidural?

261

You're too far along.

just leave the epidural
on the table and walk away.

NARRATOR: <i>Kids, sometimes the universe</i>
<i>sends exactly what you ask for.</i>

349
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,775
<i>Other times,</i>
<i>it sends Lily's dad.</i>

350
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,777
(groaning):
Oh...

351
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:04,146
Remember the time
you had your tonsils out?

352
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:05,647
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,199
You scared the crap out of me.

354
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,001
Yes, I did, didn't I?

355
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:10,703
(laughs)

356
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:11,954
Oh, my.

357
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:14,440
But do you remember
what happened next?

358
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:15,824
And don't worry,
Princess,

359
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,043
if you permanently lose
the ability to speak,

360
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,512
we'll give you
a chalkboard.

361
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:22,831
You can hang it around your
neck on a little string.

362
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,218
Nurse, I don't know
who this strange man is.

363
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,603
Security!

364
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,605
What are you talking about?
I'm your daddy.

365
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:30,556
What do you mean...

366
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:31,824
Hey, fellas, come on!

367
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:34,193
I woke up in a Dumpster
of medical waste,

368
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,645
and I couldn't
have been prouder.

369
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,815
Because, much like
that Dumpster,

370
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,201
you had a lot of guts.

371
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:46,688
And you've used that bravery
every day of your life.

372
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,241
With or without
Marshall.

373
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:52,044
You're having
this baby.

374
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,862
Thanks, Dad.

375
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,498
That story actually helped.

376
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,882
Oh, good, I'm glad.

377
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:59,251
And, you know, few women have
vaginal tearing severe enough

378
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,719
to need surgical
reconstruction...

379
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,421
Security!
Oh, come on.

380
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,556
That's not necessary.

381
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:04,723
Sweetheart, please...

382
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,425
Oh, fellas, come on.

383
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:07,843
Please, sir,
all you have to do

384
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:09,178
is take the next exit
to Manhattan.

385
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,896
You'll be back
on the road in 20 minutes.

386
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:11,931
I already told you,

387
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,215
I'm not allowed to stop.

388
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:17,219
Sir, this man is
having a baby tonight.

389
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,822
And instead of going
to Saint Marcus Hospital,

390
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:21,190
we're going to Buffalo.

391
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,076
And I've seen women from there;
the city's aptly named.

392
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,396
Look, I'm a screwup.

393
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:29,415
I had something special
with this girl Quinn,

394
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:30,533
and I ruined it.

395
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:34,169
But this guy--
he's done everything right.

396
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:36,956
He's been loving and devoted
since he was 18 years old.

397
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,593
There are only a few truly great
people on this planet,

398
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:42,094
and he is one of them.

399
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:45,798
He deserves to be
at the birth of his son.

400
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,267
So... what do you say?

401
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,520
Unless there's an emergency,
I'm not allowed to stop,

402
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:55,691
so sit down, watch
<i>Cocoon 2</i> and shut up.

403
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:02,314
I'm sorry,
buddy, I tried.

404
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,317
NARRATOR: <i>And then, something</i>
<i>wonderful happened.</i>

405
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,936
I'm having a heart attack!

406
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:12,458
I'm having a
heart attack!

407
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,376
I'm having a heart attack!

408
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:17,463
And my doctor is
at Saint Marcus Hospital!

409
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,048
MAN:
So is mine!

410
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,165
Mine, too.

411
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,784
And my son is head
of Cardiology.

412
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:24,837
ALL:
We know!

413
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:27,089
Push!

414
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,625
I wish Marshall were here!

415
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:31,260
(panting):
I'm here, baby.

416
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:32,177
Marshall!

417
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,146
I don't know why
I passed out.

418
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,016
I have delivered
12 perfectly healthy babies,

419
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,984
and one of them was even human.

420
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,636
Well, it's different
when it's someone you love.

421
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:42,488
When that head was coming
out of your best friend.

422
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,323
Oh, stop.
I'm feeling woozy again.

423
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:45,608
Don't.

424
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,975
Salt lick?

425
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,946
In return for him getting me
here, I may have promised Barney

426
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:54,950
that our son's middle name
will be Wait For It.

427
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:57,286
I can't wait, just--
what is the name?

428
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,955
The name is
Wait For It.

429
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:01,340
(screaming)

430
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:06,161
That is the coolest middle name
of all time!

431
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,630
Look, um,

432
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:11,550
I know things have been weird
between us the last few months,

433
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:12,885
but...

434
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,970
Marshall and Lily
are having a baby.

435
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:16,271
Yeah.

436
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:18,524
And, you know,
I want this baby to be born

437
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:21,010
into a world where we're okay.

438
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,746
So, friends?

439
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,414
I love you, Robin.

440
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,066
Kidding.

441
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:27,950
You...

442
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:29,017
Friends.
You...

443
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,536
(both laugh)

444
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:33,205
Guys, great news
from down the hall.

445
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:37,176
One dollar,
two bags of gummy bears!

446
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,378
It's like, I don't even care

447
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,463
what happens
for the rest of the day.

448
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,082
I...

449
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:44,583
Hey.

450
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,034
Well, guys, uh...

451
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,536
(sighs)

452
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:48,754
I'm a dad.

Oh, my God!

Everybody,

456
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,895
this is Marvin.

457
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,615
We named him after my pop.

458
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,768
Tell them the
full name.

459
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,939
Marvin Wait For It Eriksen.

460
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:09,992
That is the coolest
middle name of all-time.

461
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:11,710

NARRATOR:
<i>Which brings us to the story</i>

474
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:04,089
<i>of a wedding day</i>
<i>that went horribly wrong.</i>

475
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,225
Ted, the bride wants to see you.

476
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:11,480
<i>Uncle Barney</i>
<i>was getting married.</i>

477
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:14,533
How the hell did we get there?

478
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:19,654
I love the name Marvin.

479
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:20,989
Marv.

480
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:23,108
Sounds like a little
middle-aged man.

481
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,942
(chuckling)

482
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,043
Golf next
weekend, Marv?

483
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:26,712
How's that tax report
coming, Marv?

484
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,446
At your age,
erectile dysfunction

485
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,582
is nothing to be
ashamed of, Marv.

486
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,119
<i>It was a beautiful moment.</i>

487
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,471
<i>But then a thought popped</i>
<i>into my head, kids.</i>

488
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:38,423
The same thought that will pop
<i>into your heads</i>

489
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:41,476
<i>the first time you see your</i>
<i>best friend holding their baby.</i>

490
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,228
(staple gun clicks)

491
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,480
Wonder how much this would hurt.

492
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:46,681
(chuckles)

493
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:48,483

00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:51,953
<i>That guy's a dad.</i>

497
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,906
(baby crying)

498
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:56,942
Oh, I think he's hungry.

499
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:59,194
Oh, we'll give
you some privacy.

500
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:03,331
Wow. Seeing them in there
all together like that,

501
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,250
they're a family,
you know?

502
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:06,835
That's what I want.

503
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:09,671
Oh, Ted, I'm glad
we're friends again.

504
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:10,756
Me, too.

505
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,425
Because as your friend,
I have to tell you:

506
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:14,593
You're full of crap!

507
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:16,294
You say you want a family,

508
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,680
you say
you want to meet "The One,"

509
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:21,633
but you are always chasing
the wrong women.

510
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:22,851
That is not true.

511
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:24,186
Look at the women you date,

512
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:25,520
starting with me:

513
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,656
I told you right away
I didn't want marriage or kids.

514
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:31,276
Stella had a child with another
man who she still loved.

515
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,963
Zoey was married and trying
to sabotage your career

516
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,199
and wore a lot of stupid hats.

517
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,651
If you really wanted a family,

518
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:41,653
you would stop pursuing women

519
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,488
you know that
there is no future with.

520
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,210
Okay, first of all,
hats were in that year, kind of.

521
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:50,495
Secondly, I don't
always choose women

522
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:53,215
there's no future with, kind of.

523
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,800
Name one exception.

524
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:57,002
Victoria.

525
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:59,370
TED: <i>Victoria was great.</i>

526
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:01,306
Exactly,
and you threw it all away

527
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:03,592
to chase after some hot piece
of ass. (scoffs)

528
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:06,061
You mean you?
Thank you!

529
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:09,231
Victoria is the only
woman you've dated

530
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,632
who could've been "The One."

531
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:11,900
You should call her.

532
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:15,386
Tiny thing, last time I saw her,
she was getting engaged.

533
00:23:15,388 --> 00:23:16,538
That was eight months ago.

534
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,073
For all you know,
she's single again.

535
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,074
What if she's married?

536
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,108
What if she's not?

537
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,576
Then you would actually
have a chance

538
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:24,362
to get what you say you want,
and it terrifies you.

539
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:27,666
Why? Because if I stole a
scalpel and I cut you open,

540
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:31,920
all I would find inside is a
scared, trembling pile of crap.

541
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:34,673
See, I've missed these talks.

542
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,041
Oh, me, too.

543
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,510
Yeah.
Whoa.

544
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:40,762
What's wrong?
(sighs)

545
00:23:40,764 --> 00:23:42,580
I ruined things with Quinn.

546
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,599
I insisted she stop stripping,

547
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,551
we got in a huge fight about it,

548
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:49,771
then I ran off to Atlantic City
for two days without calling.

549
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,390
What the hell
am I coming home to?

550
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,930
Let's have an eight-way with
my six hottest stripper friends.

551
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,032
Um, how is that a punishment?

552
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,234
Wait for it.

553
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:03,618
But I forbid you from filming it

554
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,819
with your overhead camera

555
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,955
that zooms in
on whoever's being the loudest.

556
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:12,244
Nooooo!

557
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,579
(shudders)
No, that's too cruel.

558
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:18,567
Or, you know,
maybe Quinn's moved out.

559
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:22,254
I didn't even think of that!

560
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,972
(sighs)

561
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:29,144
Hi.

562
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,230
Welcome home.

563
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:36,184
I decided the place was a bit
too "American Psycho" for me,

564
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:38,803
so while you were gone,
I hired a decorator

565
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:39,804
and I asked him,

566
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,072
"What would the inside

567
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:43,325
of Tinkerbell's vagina
look like?"

568
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,594
And the kid just ran with it!

569
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,281
So... what do you think?

570
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,951
Thank God you're still here!

571
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:58,673
Welcome home.

572
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,346
NARRATOR: <i>Lily and Marshall asked Robin</i>
<i>to be the photographer</i>

573
00:25:04,348 --> 00:25:06,831
<i>for Baby Marvin's</i>
<i>Birth Announcement card</i>

574
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,633
<i>instead of me.</i>

575
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:09,634
<i>Whatever.</i>

576
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:10,969
<i>The only problem?</i>

577
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:13,088
(camera snapping)

578
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:20,278
These are terrible, Robin!

579
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,251
Hey, it is not easy
getting a good shot

580
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:23,899
cooped up in this apartment!

581
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,016
See, two different styles:

582
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:28,853
I make compositions,
Robin makes excuses.

583
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:29,854
Click!

584
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,189
Photo burn!

585
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:33,124
Okay. How about this?

586
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,627
Tomorrow, we go
to Central Park at sunset

587
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:38,546
and we get the perfect picture
in the perfect setting.

588
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,048
Oh, I like that.

589
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,917
It'll be Marvin's first
outing into the world.

590
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,586
You're gonna love
the park, buddy.

591
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,638
It's a great place
to meet chicks.

592
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,923
Or-or dudes.

593
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,175
Or both.

594
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:52,560
Oh, we love you
no matter what!

595
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:56,164
NARRATOR: <i>And kids, as I watched your</i>
<i>Aunt Lily hold her baby boy,</i>

596
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,199
<i>another thought</i>
<i>popped into my head.</i>

597
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:00,602
Even though you
didn't buy anything,

598
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:03,021
I want to thank you
for coming in.

599
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,322
Here's a free teddy bear.

600
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:06,391
What are you gonna
name the little guy?

601
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:09,494
Six Pack.

602
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,032
Gun it, bitches!

603
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:14,983
(engine revs)

604
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:16,785
NARRATOR: <i>That girl's a mom!</i>

605
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:19,537
(engine revving)

606
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:21,923
(phone chimes)

607
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:26,127
Okay, so I met this girl
on the train,

608
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:28,179
and I texted her, "What's up""

609
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:31,099
She texted,
"Hey," exclamation point.

610
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:33,852
Does that mean,
"Ask me out" or "Just..."

611
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:38,306
Ted, we are responsible for
a whole other human life now,

612
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:43,261
so new rule: You can't come
to us with any issue unless

613
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:44,313
it's an "8" or higher.

614
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:45,647
Got it.

615
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,733
So I'm thinking of texting
back a winky smiley face.

616
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:50,568
Eight or higher, bro.

617
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,569
Well, no, what should I--

618
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:52,821
Eight or higher, bro.

619
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,155
No, yeah,
I'm just wondering if--

620
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:55,907
Eight or higher, bro.

621
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:57,826
Well, where do you rate this?

622
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:01,246
This is the same as what's in
little Marvin's pants right now:

623
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,064
a soft two.

624
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:07,552
Sorry, bro.

625
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:10,939
Stop texting the bimbo
and call Victoria.

626
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,257
That chapter's over.

627
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,125
W-We just weren't destined
to be together.

628
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:19,314
"Destined." Aren't you tired
of waiting for destiny, Ted?

629
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:22,300
Isn't it time
to make your own destiny?

630
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,136
Hey, false alarm.

631
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:27,939
What I was smelling was
the previous poop,

632
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:31,014
which, apparently, is
still somewhere on my

633
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,039
clothes and/or in my hair.

634
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:36,247
Hold him, would you?
Oh. Here.

635
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:40,702
Ooh.
Yeah, smart.

636
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:42,320
(shutter clicking)

637
00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:46,908
Oh, sure, that one
turns out great. Ugh.

638
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,761
NARRATOR: And then another thought popped
<i>into my head:</i>

639
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:52,997
<i>That guy's nowhere</i>
<i>near being a dad.</i>

640
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,836
(line ringing)

641
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,171
VICTORIA: Hello?

642
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:03,358
Hey, Victoria, it's Ted.

643
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,276
Um, listen, I was just wondering

644
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,513
if you wanted to catch up
sometime; it's been a while.

645
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:09,814
That sounds nice.

646
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,450
I'm actually around
this afternoon.

647
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:15,453
Oh, wow, uh, great.

648
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:17,238
MacLaren's at 2:00?

649
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,040
Is 1:30 okay?

650
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,658
I might have a thing later.

651
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,027
Yeah. Yeah. See you then.

652
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:24,546
See you then.

653
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:27,415
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, Barney</i>
<i>and Quinn were off to Hawaii</i>

654
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,534
<i>for their first getaway</i>
<i>as a couple.</i>

655
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:31,753
Ma'am, I need you
to open your suitcase.

656
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,154
(sighing):
It's mine.

657
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,423
Did you have
to replace my luggage, too?

658
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:38,726
Run away on me again, you'll
be wearing hot pink stilettos.

659
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:41,179
What's that?

660
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:42,230
Yeah, what is that?

661
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:44,065
It's a magic trick.

662
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,717
You see, I'm something
of a magician.

663
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,718
Open the box, sir.

664
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,104
(laughing):
Oh, I can't do that.

665
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:52,390
(barking)

666
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,042
Sir, are there drugs
in that box?

667
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,194
Oh, no. He's probably
just barking

668
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,495
because of the explosives.

669
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,831
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

670
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,966
Tell us what's
in the box right now!

671
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:03,284
I can't.

672
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:05,687
Magician's Code.

673
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:10,625
TED: <i>Okay, I need to figure out</i>
<i>if Victoria ever got engaged.</i>

674
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:14,579
<i>I'll have to very subtly</i>
<i>check for an engagement ring.</i>

675
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:19,384
<i>Hmm, can't see the left hand.</i>

676
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,125
Open the box now!

677
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,360
I can't.

678
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:29,611
Magician's Code.

679
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:32,531
What the hell is
the Magician's Code?!

680
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:35,050
"A magician never
reveals his tricks."

681
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:37,035
Mr. Flanagan, my magic mentor

682
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:39,705
from the hallowed
Staten Island Mall Magic Shop,

683
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:42,074
taught me the importance
of the Code

684
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,242
one fateful autumn
night in 1993.

685
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:46,118
Always good to tell
a long story while people

686
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:47,664
are aiming guns at you.

687
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:50,782
'Twas a night which
would changed my life...

688
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:53,051
(thudding)

689
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:55,754
Hello? Mr. Flanagan.

690
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:58,473
Wh-What are you doing here?

691
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:01,677
Um...
I'm checking up on you.

692
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,980
Just to make sure
you're practicing your craft

693
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:06,231
or whatever.

694
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,850
That is an honor, sir.

695
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:11,486
And yeah, I promise,
I'm practicing.

696
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:12,854
But wait.

697
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,990
Why were you, why were you
going in my mom's room?

698
00:30:14,992 --> 00:30:18,193
Uh... your mom's actually
helping me with a new trick.

699
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:19,945
That is so cool!

700
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:21,146
What is this trick?

701
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:22,497
Is it sawing a lady in half?

702
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:23,915
(wry chuckle)

703
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,283
Well, not sawing.

704
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:26,485
But actually,

705
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:27,786
the Magician's Code forbids me

706
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:30,488
from telling you anything else
about the trick.

707
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,958
LORETTA:
Wayne, come back to bed!

708
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,876
Okay, it involves a bed.

709
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:38,013
W-W-Wait. Can
you at least

710
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,648
tell me the name of this trick?

711
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,000
Sure, kid.

712
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,351
It's called--

713
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:45,487
The Disappearing Salami.

714
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,590
Mr. Flanagan's wife shot him

715
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:51,493
before he could ever tell me
what the trick was.

716
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:52,915
Yeah, that guy was
banging your mom.

717
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:53,812
Yup.

718
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:54,946
Totally.

719
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:57,032
Mr. Flanagan was not ban--

720
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:59,034
Oh, my God, he was.

721
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:02,370
Wait, why are you bringing
a magic trick to Hawaii anyway?

722
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:05,824
I was hoping to shoot up
to Honolulu

723
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:07,793
for the Worldwide
Magic Convention.

724
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:09,694
Don't worry. You'll
notice I was gone.

725
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:11,696
It's only three
14-hour days.

726
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:13,381
So on our romantic getaway

727
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:16,134
to help me forget about
you skipping town on me,

728
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:17,836
you're skipping town on me?!

729
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:21,372
Look Quinn, you're
very important to me,

730
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:26,544
but you're sharing my heart
with an equally important Miss.

731
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:30,482
Miss...

732
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:32,484
Direction.

733
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,652
What?

734
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:35,821
H...

735
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,572
Shoot him.

736
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:40,225
So what did you order?

737
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,611
Oh, just black coffee.

738
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:43,829
I like it that way, too.

739
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:45,413
Yeah, it just tastes
better to me.

740
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,199
I find that if the coffee beans
are good enough,

741
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,901
you really don't need--
Why are you in a wedding dress?!

742
00:31:49,903 --> 00:31:53,404
Well, I'm sort of supposed to...

743
00:31:53,406 --> 00:31:56,124
get married today.

744
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,742
All your friends and family
are waiting for you

745
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:58,927
in some church right now?

746
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:02,631
Well, not all; we had
five last-minute no-shows.

747
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,082
Well... six.

748
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:06,885
Mazel tov, Ted.

749
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,387
I was starting to think
this would never happen.

750
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:10,472
Oh, no, Mrs. Matsen--

751
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:12,390
MRS. MATSEN: I told
you he wasn't gay.

752
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:14,092
Wait, what?

753
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,979
I was tempted to leave Klaus
for you last fall.

754
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:21,316
The only thing holding me back
was the Robin of it all.

755
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:24,435
I know, and you were right,
but... but that's all over now.

756
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:27,906
She moved out-- I mean, we're
still friends, but that's over.

757
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:31,726
All these years, I never stopped
thinking about you, Ted.

758
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,663
I've got a car outside

759
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:38,300
if you're ready to drive off
into the sunset together.

760
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:43,004
But if you don't feel
the same way,

761
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:45,957
if you've closed the door on us,

762
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,676
just say the word...

763
00:32:47,678 --> 00:32:49,227
and I'll go.

764
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,097
Barney, tell them the trick.

765
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:54,733
The only person I could possibly
reveal the trick to

766
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:55,767
is another magician.

767
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:59,304
Well, I'm a magician.

768
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:01,072
Prove it.

769
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,530
Whoo-hoo!

770
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,715
(gasps)

771
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,341
NARRATOR:
<i>That's Barney's version.</i>

772
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:21,343
<i>Quinn said it was</i>
<i>a simple card trick.</i>

773
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:24,012
<i>Who's to say which</i>
<i>version was true?</i>

774
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:25,847
<i>Quinn's.</i>
<i>Quinn's version was true.</i>

775
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,017
Okay.

776
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:31,219
I'll tell you.

777
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,024
Oh, that's really cool.

778
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:38,777
So what's the trick?

779
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,829
I can't say.
Magician's Code.

780
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,681
(gasps):
Ta-da...

781
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,984
da-da-da-da-da-da.

782
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:47,118
(cell phone ringing)

783
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:48,904
Hello.

784
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:51,623
Why did you make me
call Victoria?

785
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,208
She's here in a wedding dress.

786
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,543
I'm the verge of
ruining a wedding!

787
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:56,912
And Mrs. Madsen's friend
thinks I'm gay,

788
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:58,496
but let's put a pin
in that till later.

789
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,665
Oh, my God.
Victoria's at the bar with Ted.

790
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:02,167
That's a seven.

791
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:03,802
And she's in a wedding dress.

792
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,720
That's a ten.

793
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,889
We got a ten!

794
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,209
What are you gonna do?
Where is she right now?

795
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:12,677
So this dress, what's the cut?

796
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,763
Are we talking princess,
ball gown, column?

797
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:18,266
Right, 'cause it's a federal
crime to love weddings.

798
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:19,768
She's in the bathroom,
which I guess

799
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,487
takes forever with that
giant poufy skirt thing.

800
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,739
Ball gown. Thank you.

801
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:25,824
Four shots of tequila.

802
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:27,242
Ted, calm down.

803
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:29,160
Or not. This is your chance
to get the one who got away.

804
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:30,695
You want her,
she wants you,

805
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:32,080
what's the problem?

806
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:34,666
The problem is Victoria's in
the middle of a giant freak-out.

807
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,734
What if she winds up
regretting this decision?

808
00:34:36,736 --> 00:34:38,753
She's going after Ted Mosby.

809
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:40,939
That's the best decision
she's ever made.

810
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,757
There you go.

811
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:50,281
Whoa. What was that?
What?

812
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:52,684
You said you wanted a picture
of Baby Marvin's first outing.

813
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:56,187
Our baby's first outing

814
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:57,422
was to a bar.

815
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:58,523
(gasps)

816
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,226
I dribble Cuervo
on Marv's soft spot.

817
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:02,027
Here she comes! Quick!

818
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:03,428
Oh, yeah.

819
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,762
Eggshell or cream?

820
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:06,948
Is it eggshell or cream?

821
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:09,401
So.

822
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:12,988
You... me...
riding off into the sunset.

823
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,772
Any thoughts?

824
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:17,058
One question:

825
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,294
FDR or Westside Highway,

826
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:21,046
what's the quickest
way to the sunset?

827
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,802
Man, I wind up in
these rooms a lot.

828
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,722
If we miss Hawaii because of
this, guess who's not doing

829
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:32,957
The Disappearing Salami
anytime soon?

830
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:36,728
I need to ask you both
a few questions.

831
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,129
Let's start with you.

832
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:39,130
Name?

833
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,398
Quinn Garvey.

834
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,483
Occupation?

835
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:43,101
Unemployed.

836
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:44,436
Well, well, well.

837
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:45,737
Look who's keeping secrets now.

838
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,189
Sir, I'll tell you her
occupation: stripper.

839
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:49,824
She insists she's proud of it,

840
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:52,310
but apparently not
proud enough to tell you.

841
00:35:52,312 --> 00:35:55,914
Barney, I was going to surprise
you with this on our trip,

842
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:58,433
but... I quit.

843
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,587
You... did that for me?

844
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:04,072
Yes.

845
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,458
And now that you know
what I did for you,

846
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,593
and how much I care for you,

847
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,429
would you please
show him the trick?

848
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:19,120
Sorry. Magician's Code.

849
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:25,343
Where should we go?

850
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:26,844
Your place?

851
00:36:26,846 --> 00:36:28,012
My place?

852
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,347
We could go on my honeymoon.

853
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:30,848
(laughs)

854
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,849
Just kidding.

855
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:33,935
Although, it is paid for.

856
00:36:35,738 --> 00:36:37,705
I know where we should go.
Where?

857
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:39,491
Your wedding.

858
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:40,692
I'm taking you back.

859
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,789
I don't understand.

860
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,090
I thought you wanted this.

861
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:53,458
I do want this.

862
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,311
I've thought about you
so many times.

863
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,897
What might have been...

864
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,966
But I got left at the altar,
and it nearly killed me.

865
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:04,770
You're someone's fiancé,

866
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,605
and I have to respect that.

867
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,274
So let's hit a motel,
jam in a quickie,

868
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:10,308
and get you back
to your wedding.

869
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,360
(giggles)

870
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,578
It's the right thing to do.

871
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,531
Some part of me
needed to hear you say

872
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,500
that running away together
wasn't an option.

873
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,036
And now that I know that...

874
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,255
it's like I'm sobering up.

875
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:27,376
Is there any way

876
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,928
that we can just pretend
this never happened?

877
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:33,231
This never happened.

878
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:41,340
Mr. Flanagan wasn't
banging my mom.

879
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:44,342
Well.

880
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:46,144
Your flight left.

881
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:49,481
We need to hold Mr. Stinson
for further questioning.

882
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:51,015
But you're free to go.

883
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:55,754
Maybe I should.

884
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:59,241
Wait!

885
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,493
I'll show you the trick.

886
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:08,366
Sir!

887
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:10,001
May I please have
the silk handkerchief

888
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:11,336
in your top left breast pocket?

889
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:13,505
Well... I don't have...

890
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,059
(chuckles)

891
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,260
(clears throat)

892
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:30,221
Sim salabi ma...
sim salabi ma...

893
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:32,991
(gasps)

894
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:34,493
Relax, relax,
it's part of the trick.

895
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,244
How did you get that
through the X-Ray machine?

896
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,029
No questions from
the audience, please!

897
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:44,369
(chanting nonsense syllables)

898
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:52,844
What is that?

899
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,012
Madam, may I please have

900
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:55,914
the key on your necklace?

901
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:57,682
Oh!

902
00:38:57,684 --> 00:38:58,884
(giggles)

903
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:04,973
(beeping)

904
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,391
Is that gonna explode?

905
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:07,759
What?

906
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,778
(screams)

907
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,780
(coughing)

908
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,315
Ahem.

909
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,534
(mock gasps)

910
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:17,819
What?

911
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:44,629
(loudly):
Will you marry me?

912
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:47,566
Yes.

913
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:53,238
(laughing)

914
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,773
Come on, guys.

915
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,726
We're losing the light
for Baby's Second First Outing.

916
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,755
NARRATOR: <i>I hate to say it,</i>
<i>but Robin nailed it.</i>

917
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:12,958
(door closes)

918
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:16,327
Hey.
Guys, we've got something to tell you.

919
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:18,046
Eight or higher, bro.

920
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,548
We're engaged.

921
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,300
That's a... that's a ten.

922
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:24,302
We got another ten!

923
00:40:24,304 --> 00:40:25,971
Oh...
Wow, big day!

924
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,390
Congratulations!
Thank you.

925
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,174
How did this happen?

926
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:32,394
Oh... magic.

927
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,896
Oh.

928
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:36,281
Uh, not to ruin the moment,

929
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:39,568
but apparently little Marvin
is quite stunned by the news.

930
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,037
Well...

931
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,371
Yeah. Wow.
Yeah.

932
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:45,540
Do you guys mind
recounting this romantic tale

933
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,958
next to a Diaper Genie?

934
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,030
Oh, Marvin, you're about to
hear your first love story!

935
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,364
QUINN:
Once up on a time,

936
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:56,585
this creepy magic dude
was boning Barney's mom...

937
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:03,925
It's our last chance
to run away together.

938
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:04,976
Door's right there.

939
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:06,595
Yes, we'll start a new life.

940
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,063
Head for the border!
Canada!

941
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,015
Eh, Mexico.
Canada sucks.

942
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:11,816
Okay, well,
you're one-quarter Canadian,

943
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:13,652
so by that logic
you one-quarter suck.

944
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,020
I'm 100% awesome

945
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:16,521
and you know it.

946
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:18,990
Yeah, I do.

947
00:41:21,193 --> 00:41:22,911
(clears throat)

948
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,498
Look, I-I hope this isn't weird,
or anything, because...

949
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,366
Barney...

950
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:30,869
I'm... I'm really happy for you.

951
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:32,704
