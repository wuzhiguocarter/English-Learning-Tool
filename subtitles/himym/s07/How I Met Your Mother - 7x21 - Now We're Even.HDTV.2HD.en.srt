1
00:00:01,385 --> 00:00:02,718
So, how's living alone?

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:04,134
You know, it's interesting.

3
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:06,269
When I first moved into
my new apartment,

4
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,804
<i>I was nervous.</i>

5
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:11,691
<i>For the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate.</i>

6
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:13,360
<i>But then it hit me:</i>

7
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:17,631
<i>for the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate!</i>

8
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:23,686
<i>If I want to walk around naked,</i>
<i>nobody cares.</i>

9
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:25,538
<i>If I want to leave</i>
<i>the laundry basket</i>

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,576
<i>in the middle of the living</i>
<i>room, nobody stops me.</i>

11
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:31,628
<i>If I bring home soup</i>
<i>from the deli</i>

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,697
<i>and leave it in the fridge</i>
<i>for two days, nobody eats it.</i>

13
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,634
<i>And if I do something</i>
<i>colossally stupid,</i>

14
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:40,036
<i>nobody ever has to know.</i>

15
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:42,222
(loud, high-pitched gasping)

16
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,342
People make fun of the guy

17
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,761
who stays home every night
doing nothing.

18
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:51,748
But the truth is...
that guy's a genius.

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,051
<i>Because let's be honest,</i>
<i>sitting around watching TV,</i>

20
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:57,887
<i>drinking beer and eating ribs</i>
<i>alone is what every</i>

21
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:02,842
<i>red-blooded American would</i>
<i>rather be doing at all times.</i>

22
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:06,529
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better
to have someone to share the...

23
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:09,949
I mean, don't you
get lonely without...

24
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:12,068
Yeah, that sounds pretty great.

27
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:26,163
What's the best thing

28
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,716
about dating a stripper,
you ask?

29
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:29,700
Nope.

30
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:31,201
Just asked for your drink order.

31
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,920
I'll tell you the best thing
about dating a stripper.

32
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:33,887
He'll just have a scotch.

33
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:34,972
Getting to say,

34
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:36,890
"Hey, I'm dating a stripper."

35
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,392
And I should go.

36
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:40,144
Time to make the doughnuts.
(chuckles)

37
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,930
More like time to make some
dough sitting on some nuts.

38
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,014
(chuckles)
She's a stripper.

39
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,015
I'm dating her.

40
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:46,233
I'm dating a stripper.
Barney wins.

41
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,151
I'll walk you out.

42
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:49,553
Hey, where are
you going?

43
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,155
Quinn needs to get to work.
She's a...

44
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,056
I know, a stripper, got it.

45
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,658
Hey, taxi!

46
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,659
(whistles)

47
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,861
My girlfriend's a stripper!

48
00:01:57,863 --> 00:02:01,231
So, Ted, guess where we're
having dinner Friday night.

49
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,916
Chez L'Argent.

50
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:04,334
I am so excited.

51
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:06,370
We've been trying forever
to get this reservation.

52
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:08,255
Can you hold on
for just one second?

53
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:09,623
What the hell
are you doing?

54
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,791
Nothing.

55
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:12,710
Did you say
you had to pee?

56
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,211
No.

57
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:16,046
But yeah, I do have to pee.

58
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,932
Man, this kid better be
real freakin' cute!

59
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:22,636
What was that all about?

60
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:24,605
Lily had a sex dream last night.

61
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:25,922
(bullet ricocheting)

62
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:27,391
Sex dream?
Do tell.

63
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:30,927
I was painting
the baby furniture...

64
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:34,648
(moaning):
Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,868
Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,320
Hurry up,
before Marshall gets home.

67
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:42,489
Oh, oh...

68
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:48,162
Whoa!

69
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:49,163
I'm sorry, baby.

70
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:50,731
Were you asleep?

71
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,217
All pregnant ladies
have crazy sex dreams.

72
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,003
It's just her hormones
going berserk.

73
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,639
So who's responsible for her
rapid thigh movement this time?

74
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:00,674
Oh, my favorite was when
she banged George Washington.

75
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:04,127
I liked the three-way with
Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.

76
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,513
Oh, he smurfed
the smurf out of her.

77
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,315
Yes, while The Cos
smurfed off in the corner.

78
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:10,267
We all remember.
But here's the thing.

79
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,637
When Lily has dirty dreams
about other people,

80
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,355
she always tells me.

81
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:16,673
But this time...

82
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:20,661
Sounds like you
had a crazy dream.

83
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:23,163
What was it about?

84
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:28,752
And then her face turned...

85
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,421
<i>vermilion.</i>

86
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:35,826
Just... you and me...

87
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:38,762
gettin' it on, monogamously.

88
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:44,434
Monoga-me-oh-my.

89
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:47,504
Not the rose quartz
of the slightly embarrassed,

90
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:50,390
or the tomato red
of the mildly abashed,

91
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:54,144
vermilion, the color
of carnal shame.

92
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:58,198
Can only mean one thing:

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,701
Lily dream-banged
someone we know.

94
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:03,287
Okay, you caught me
vermilion-handed.

95
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,707
The truth is, I've spent
the last five years

96
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,409
trying to inception
your wife.

97
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:11,495
That movie only came out
two years ago.

98
00:04:11,497 --> 00:04:13,547
What movie?

99
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,499
You know who I bet it is?

100
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,084
Robin.
(gasps)

101
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,969
Already checked.

102
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,420
<i>Lily and I paid her a visit</i>

103
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:22,589
<i>at the new World Wide News</i>
<i>headquarters.</i>

104
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,558
And I'm so excited,
because I've been trying months

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,542
to get this reservation.

106
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:26,927
Can you hold on
just one second?

107
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,178
What the hell
are you doing?!

108
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,263
Nothing.

109
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,481
Nice photo.
Oh.

110
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,517
Your passport
must be enormous.

111
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,152
(chuckles)
Ugh.

112
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:38,722
You know, for the record,
I didn't want this.

113
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:41,024
Didn't want it,
did not approve it.

114
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:42,109
(chuckles)

115
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,577
It's super embarrassing.

116
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,896
Hey, Merle.

117
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:49,349
So, uh, do you guys
want to come up and see my desk?

118
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:50,617
Yeah, why not?

119
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,169
Come on.

120
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,670
I.D.?

121
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,572
Oh. Um, that is me.

122
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:56,957
(chuckles)

123
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,074
Ma'am, with all due respect,

124
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:00,377
you're a wee bit older
than that hottie.

125
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,345
(scoffs)

126
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:02,596
For God sakes.

127
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:06,049
You know, here I am,
on national TV every day,

128
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:09,519
and still a guy who spends
his whole life sitting next to

129
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,889
a giant picture of me
has no idea who I am.

130
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:14,141
This isn't my whole life;
I'm in a band.

131
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:15,409
And we're gonna make it.

132
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:17,644
NARRATOR:
<i>And, kids, they did make it.</i>

133
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:20,013
<i>But I'll get to that later.</i>

134
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:22,783
<i>You know what, I'm probably not</i>
<i>going to get to that later.</i>

135
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:26,453
<i>They had one song,</i>
<i>it didn't suck, the end.</i>

136
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:28,989
You always said
it wasn't about being famous.

137
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,441
You just want to do
solid journalism, right?

138
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,043
Yeah, well...

139
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,245
Of course I want
to be famous!

140
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,613
In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles.

141
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:37,798
I was a cabinhold name.

142
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,899
But here?

143
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:40,250
Don't need to see
your I.D., Merle.

144
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,919
Everyone knows
who you are.

145
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,220
You're Merle.

146
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,222
He was in one skit
in the Christmas party!

147
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:46,590
(sighs)

148
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:48,959
Uh, by the way,
how is Ted doing?

149
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,744
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, you remember</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

150
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:52,846
<i>I declared my love,</i>
<i>she turned me down,</i>

151
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,565
<i>we both moved out of</i>
<i>the apartment, and now...</i>

152
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:58,101
I haven't talked to him
since we... stopped talking.

153
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,135
(chuckles)

154
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:01,271
He's pretty good.

155
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,522
Pretty good?

156
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:04,891
Last night, you ate
a box of Froot Loops

157
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:05,993
in your tighty whities.

158
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:08,996
No, I demolished
a box of Froot Loops,

159
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:11,748
fully nude.

160
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,167
Yeah, "pretty good" works.

161
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,336
Hey, Barney.

162
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:18,505
Hey, Lily.

163
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,961
Do you know
what this is about?

164
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:24,628
Uh-huh.

165
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,846
Do I want to know?

166
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,831
No, sorry, bro.

167
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,049
Damn it!

168
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:30,500
Okay, time
for my stuff.

169
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,719
Guys, I was sitting
at home last night,

170
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,355
and all of a sudden,
I had a piphany.

171
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:36,723
And my piphany
was this...

172
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,558
Actually, it's, uh,
it's "epiphany."

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,194
No, Ted, this
is <i>the</i> piphany.

174
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:42,562
And here it is:

175
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:46,867
Make... every...
night... legendary.

176
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,402
Guys, we've had

177
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:50,153
some pretty
legendary nights.

178
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,572
But we've also had some nights
that weren't so legendary.

179
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:55,742
Lookin' at you, The Night Ted
Made Us All Watch <i>Norbit.</i>

180
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:58,495
Eddie Murphy as a fat lady;
what's the problem?

181
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,130
That was Eddie Murphy?

182
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:02,132
The non-legendary
nights are done.

183
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:05,218
From here on in, every
single night of our lives

184
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,370
will be a night
we'll never forget.

185
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,423
Starting tonight.

186
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:13,376
Who's ready for the longest,
craziest adventure yet?!

187
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:14,561
(bullet ricocheting)

188
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:16,229
Good.

189
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:18,715
The weak have been
weeded from our herd.

190
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:20,600
You ready to rock
and roll, Ted?

191
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:21,885
Yeah, I'm going home, too.

192
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:23,453
I'm sensing some costumes
coming up here

193
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:24,604
and I'd rather steer clear.

194
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,973
Ted, 20 years from now,

195
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,159
when you're all alone
and I'm President,

196
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:30,277
you're not
gonna remember

197
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,279
sitting around your
apartment doing nothing.

198
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,581
What you will remember
is that tonight,

199
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,983
this night...

200
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:40,220
was The Night We Started
a Mariachi Band!

201
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:42,089
<i>Uno, dos, tres, quatro!</i>

202
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:46,376
(mariachi song ends)

203
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:47,744
(cheering)

204
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,581
Okay, you were right.

205
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,766
Memorable night.

206
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,918
That was nothing
compared to <i>mañana,</i> amigo.

207
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,970
Because <i>mañana</i> is gonna be...

208
00:07:56,972 --> 00:07:59,422
The Night We Ate Everything
on the Menu!

209
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,042
(groans)

210
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,944
A really memorable night.

211
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:05,095
But tomorrow night...

212
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:08,215
Is The Night We Brought
a Horse into the Bar!

213
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:11,701
Okay, but tomorrow...

214
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:15,389
Is The Night We Bungee Jump
off the Statue of Liberty!

215
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,043
Nope.

216
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,245
NARRATOR: <i>That night was the night</i>
<i>of Aunt Lily</i>

217
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:23,997
<i>and Uncle Marshall's</i>
<i>fancy dinner.</i>

218
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:27,117
Complete with a fancy limo ride.

219
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,085
Surprise!

220
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,252
Hello!

221
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,905
Hi, Ranjit.

222
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,593
No.

223
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:44,338
Should I take the
West Side Highway?

224
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,306
Why not, Ranjit?

225
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,442
Don't you always just
take whatever you want,

226
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,344
regardless of
anything but your own

227
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,897
dirty, sick,
twisted appetites?

228
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:59,436
I'll stay on Broadway.

229
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:01,938
I.D.?

230
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,241
For God's sakes, open your...

231
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,360
Yeah, that's about right.

232
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:07,995
I.D.?

233
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,080
NARRATOR: <i>Robin had finally</i>
<i>learned the lesson</i>

234
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,165
<i>that nobody</i>
<i>gets famous overnight.</i>

235
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,700
<i>But here's the crazy part:</i>

236
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:15,735
<i>that night, she got famous.</i>

237
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:16,903
Robin, there you are.

238
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:18,238
Sandy Rivers!

239
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,373
Star of the show.

240
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,425
What it is, my man.
Yeah.

241
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,093
Robin, I've got
something big for you,

242
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,845
something huge.

243
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:26,780
And I want you on it.

244
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,916
Sandy, you were
<i>in</i> the harassment video.

245
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:31,251
You were great in that,
by the way.

246
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,252
Thanks, holmes.

247
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:33,553
And I like the way

248
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,522
your filthy little mind works,
Robin, but this is real.

249
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:36,473
Big story's breaking.

250
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,108
Are you afraid of helicopters?

251
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,759
I love helicopters.

252
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:42,279
What am I covering, a war?
Better!

253
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,716
ANNOUNCER: <i>World Wide News</i>
<i>brings you the world.</i>

254
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,701
<i>And now Robin Scherbatsky</i>
<i>with traffic.</i>

255
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:52,605
You don't want to go
bungee jumping, fine.

256
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:55,608
Tonight's The Night
We Stole a Mummy

257
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,045
from the Natural History Museum!

258
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,281
Yeah, I'm not
doing that.

259
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:05,719
Then get out your MetroCard,
Ted, because tonight's

260
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:08,621
The Night We Partied
with the Mole People!

261
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:12,959
Barney, I have a Stouffer's
lasagna for one in the freezer

262
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,678
that is going to be
unforgettable.

263
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,813
I have a <i>Sanford and Son</i>
on my DVR

264
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,516
that I will take with me
to my grave.

265
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,235
I don't need tonight to be
any more memorable than that.

266
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:25,155
Okay, <i>Sanford and Son</i>
does sound good.

267
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,992
But if I could just present
a counter argument...

268
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:33,830
(imitates Redd Foxx):
You're locked out, dummy!

269
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,615
Damn it! Barney!

270
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:37,650
Give me your phone;
I'm calling my super.

271
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,153
The only person we're calling
is everyone we know,

272
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:43,457
because tonight's The Night
We Tracked Down Phil Collins,

273
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:46,159
Became Best Friends with Him,
and Talked Him into Reuniting

274
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:48,512
with Peter Gabriel,
So Then We Got to Sing Backup

275
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,415
On The New Genesis Album
and It Was Awesome!

276
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,501
Fine, I'll use the
phone at the bar.

277
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:59,723
Ranjit, would you please
put up the partition?

278
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,726
Partition going up.

279
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,844
You had a sex dream
about Ranjit!

280
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:06,346
Hello.

281
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:07,781
Ranjit!

282
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,349
Sorry.

283
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:11,351
Okay, yes, I did,

284
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:14,070
but it didn't
mean anything.

285
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,323
Okay, well, what
happened in this dream?

286
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:17,690
And I want to
know everything.

287
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:19,025
Every explicit detail.

288
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:20,377
Don't leave out any...

289
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,129
Damn it, Ranjit!

290
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,131
Sorry.

291
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,501
Marshall, it was a dream.

292
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:28,885
Yeah, well, dreams
are just stuff

293
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,171
that you subconsciously
want to happen.

294
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:32,806
Why do you think
I'm constantly dreaming

295
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,707
about Bigfoot playing
quarterback for the Vikings?

296
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,978
Because you fall asleep
looking at a painting of it.

297
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,479
It soothes me.

298
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,848
Don't try to change the subject.

299
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,767
You sleep-cheated.

300
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,885
You've been
sleep-sleeping around,

301
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:47,070
and I'm sick of it.

302
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:48,522
You know,
I have half a mind

303
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,574
to get out and let you
eat all by yourself.

304
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,859
Should I pull over?

305
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,060
Damn it, Ranjit!

306
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:56,413
Yes, Ranjit.
Pull over.

307
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,749
Pulling over.

308
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:00,917
You watch, Ted.

309
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,570
Tonight is going
to be legen--

310
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:05,655
it's the night
we stole a camel...

311
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:10,794
...which means it'll be
full of drama-- dary.

312
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,762
Dromedary!

313
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:16,349
I applaud your wordplay,
but your core premise is flawed.

314
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,518
Every night
can't be legendary.

315
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,055
If all nights are legendary,
no nights are legendary.

316
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:25,342
See, Ted,
that attitude right there,

317
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,043
that's why I'm in the lead.

318
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,395
What do you mean, in the lead?

319
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,263
I'm talking about
the game of life, Ted.

320
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:31,398
Scoreboard.

321
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,450
Better wardrobe:
75 points.

322
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,986
Apartment on a higher floor:
90 points.

323
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,672
Longer name: 110 points.

324
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,740
Sorry. Did you just make up
this point system?

325
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:43,009
Made up the point system:
114 points.

326
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,111
And ten points to you
for pointing that out.

327
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:46,446
Nice job, Ted.

328
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,532
15 points to me
for being gracious enough

329
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,900
to give you those ten points.

330
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,134
But here's the point, Ted.

331
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,302
Every time I go out

332
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,520
and have an awesome night

333
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,654
and you're not there,

334
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:56,289
that's another 100 points
in my column.

335
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,358
So yeah, I'm in the lead.

336
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,144
Barney, the fact that I
can stay home for a night

337
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:03,463
shows that I have inner peace

338
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:05,515
and that I don't feel
the need to keep score.

339
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,183
That's worth like
1,000 points right there,

340
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:09,853
so at the very
least, we're tied.

341
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,738
We're so not tied.

342
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,173
Although you know
what is tied--

343
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,442
the strap
of my girlfriend's bikini.

344
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:17,444
Except when it's not,
'cause she's a stripper.

345
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,145
One million points!
Game.

346
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:20,580
Shh.

347
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:21,665
It's over.

348
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,633
It's done. It's done.

349
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,986
So what do you do?

350
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:28,321
(laughs)
You're kidding, right?

351
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:30,123
I... I'm an on-air reporter.

352
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,425
I just did a report
like five minutes ago.

353
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,160
You sound frustrated.

354
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:35,495
Yeah, I am.

355
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:39,499
I'm busting my ass,
and as usual, no recognition.

356
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,602
Robin, I've been
doing this a while,

357
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:45,105
and if there's one thing
I've learned, it's flarm.

358
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,223
What?
Flarm.

359
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,175
Flarm, flarm, flarm.

360
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:50,727
Blobbum.

361
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,612
(laughing):
What is wrong with you?

362
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,230
Are you having a stroke?

363
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,015
NARRATOR:
<i>As a matter of fact, he was.</i>

364
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:57,734
Oh! Hold on! Wait!

365
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,135
<i>Meanwhile, Lily was in</i>

366
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,321
<i>desperate need</i>
<i>of a female friend.</i>

367
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,290
Lily, I have seen this
a million times.

368
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,825
Guys go crazy when there's
a baby on the way.

369
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:08,194
You should have seen the manager
when his wife got pregnant.

370
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:11,831
After the second trimester,
he made her stop stripping.

371
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,167
Yeah, you're right.

372
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,719
Now I feel bad.

373
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,203
Our big dinner's been ruined.

374
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,723
Marshall's
probably crying right now.

375
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,475
(crying): I had no idea that
food could be this delicious.

376
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:25,545
Marshall, you are being crazy.

377
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,547
No, no, I can handle it.

378
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:28,881
If I sell my laptop,

379
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,685
we can get seconds
on those squash blossoms.

380
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,069
I mean about Lily.

381
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,439
Well, you know,
she's being crazy, too.

382
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,557
She's pregnant.

383
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,992
She gets to be crazy.

384
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:40,994
You have to be the sane one.

385
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,829
So what, I don't get to be
crazy again

386
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:44,063
until the baby comes?

387
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:47,200
No. Then it's baby's turn
to be crazy.

388
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,902
When do I get to be crazy again?

389
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:51,404
Never.

390
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:53,106
(cackling)

391
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:58,011
We are totally even.

392
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,130
We absolutely are not even,
and here's why.

393
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,681
I'll grant you
that if you include

394
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,217
the 12 points
for designing the skyscraper,

395
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,519
the 83 points for slapping five
with Tommy Lee

396
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,572
and the 9,000 points
for banging Robin before me,

397
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,242
our point totals
would be about neck and neck,

398
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,144
but there's one thing
you're forgetting.

399
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,395
The fact that I don't care?

400
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,746
No.

401
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,249
And you just lost five points
for sass.

402
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,236
Do you remember a conversation
we had about three years ago?

403
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:25,655
Barney, you're
the king.

404
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,207
Nobody picks up chicks like you.

405
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,458
You're handsome,

406
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,293
debonair,

407
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,379
everything I wish I could be.

408
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm starting to think
this never happened.

409
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:36,099
Let you finish.

410
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,618
You're smooth,
charismatic,

411
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,586
"sauve."

412
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,087
I think you mean "suave."

413
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:42,322
Aha.

414
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,474
So you do remember.

415
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,759
But there's one thing

416
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:48,628
even a master ladies' man
like you could never do,

417
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,230
and if you could
ever do it,

418
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,232
it would be worth 500 points.

419
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:56,019
You have my attention,
my slightly shorter friend.

420
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,604
Here's the challenge.

421
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:01,758
Get a girl's phone number
while you're wearing a dress.

422
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:06,329
Challenge...

423
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,031
Accomplished.

424
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,115
That's right.

425
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:10,784
Last year,
I slapped on a dress,

426
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,652
took a few laps
around this very bar,

427
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,154
and I got this:

428
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:16,823
the phone number
of one Stephanie McColgan.

429
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,992
Later that night,
I took off my pantyhose,

430
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:22,679
and gave her panties...
my hose.

431
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,996
That's right, Ted.

432
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:26,299
I am 500 points ahead.

433
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,268
Until you can get
a girl's digits

434
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,838
while wearing a dress,
you and I will never be even.

435
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,773
You know what? The super's
probably waiting for me,

436
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:35,558
and I just remembered
there's a spare key

437
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,310
under the doormat, so good night.
Wait, wait.

438
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:38,678
Ted, don't go.
Barney, I am leaving.

439
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,814
I'm afraid this is just
one of those nights

440
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,449
we're probably going to forget.

441
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,317
I don't think so, dude. Look.

442
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,902
REPORTER: If you're just joining us,

444
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:50,590

by our own Robin Scherbatsky.

445
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,792
This probably won't end well.

454
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,959
I did it!

468

469
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,131
Hey, Marshall.

470
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,033
Hey, Lil.

471
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,035
Hey, Barney.

472
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,471
Yes, I know
you're dating a stripper.

473
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:03,839
Mm-hmm.

476
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,898
Okay, I'll keep trying.

477
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,735
Babe, I think
I know why you had

478
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:19,438
that sex dream about Ranjit.
Why?

479
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,739
Think about it.

480
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,741
The way he talks
about his kids.

481
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:24,726
He's a wonderful father.

482
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,364
Just like Papa Smurf,
Bill Cosby...

483
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:31,200
George Washington,
the father of our country.

484
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:34,203
You're attracted
to great dads.

485
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,038
And that's why you love me.

486
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,575
Because I'm going to be
the greatest dad ever.

487
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,094

I can't go home, Ted.
Why not?
