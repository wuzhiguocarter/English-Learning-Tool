NARRATOR: <i>In May of 2012,</i>
<i>Marshall and Lily</i>

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,843
<i>hosted a baby shower</i>
<i>in the apartment.</i>

3
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:06,227
<i>All their friends were there.</i>

4
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:08,880
<i>So of course I made sure</i>
<i>to show up exactly...</i>

5
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:09,931
(knocking)

6
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:11,266
<i>...three hours late.</i>

7
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:14,352
- Oh, no! Am I late?
- Little bit.

8
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:17,522
Ah, I'm sorry, I would've gotten
here earlier; it's just, um...

9
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:20,108
- You didn't want to see Robin.
- I didn't want to see Robin.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,310
I know, it's childish.

11
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:23,478
She's not here, is she?

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,963
Actually...

13
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:30,068
(gasps) Oh, no! Am I early?

14
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,769
Little bit.

15
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:36,040
Whoa, she got you
the red stroller?

16
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:40,461
Looks like I just blew her
out of the water.

17
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:42,964
Anyway, he left
before the party started.

18
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,782
Ah, I'm really sorry, I...

19
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:46,751
I just think it's
best if Robin and I

20
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:48,503
don't see each
other for a while.

21
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:51,122
Ted, it's fine;
I'm a child of divorce.

22
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:53,091
You guys keep fighting
all you want,

23
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:55,143
as long as the expensive gifts
keep coming.

24
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,228
(chuckles) Uh, so
how was the shower?

25
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,479
It was good,

26
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,181
although there was
one weird moment

27
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,450
with Barney's new
stripper girlfriend.

28
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:04,102
50 laps a day?

29
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:07,188
Oh, my goodness, young lady.
That is a lot.

30
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,907
Oh, is it?

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,809
Is it a lot, Grandma Lois?

32
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:14,862
Yes, my girlfriend
gets naked

33
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,497
and sits on guys' laps
for money.

34
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:19,867
And, yes, sometimes it's as
many as 50 laps in one day.

35
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:23,288
And maybe society
considers what she does

36
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,373
to be "disgusting,"

37
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,991
or "slutty,"

38
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:29,877
or verging on "prostitution,"

39
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,830
or actual "prostitution."

40
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,099
But you know what,
I accept her.

41
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:37,552
And if you can't do the same,

42
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:40,671
well, then shame on you.

43
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:43,942
Shame...

44
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,176
on...

45
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:46,844
you.

46
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:52,033
We were, um, talking
about swimming.

47
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:55,703
How I sometimes swim
50 laps a day.

48
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,990
(snorts) Well,
it's great cardio.

49
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:01,960
Lois, can I top off
your champagne?

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

52
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,239
You know, it's funny,

53
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,808
you tell the average guy
you're dating a stripper,

54
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,976
he thinks it's awesome.

55
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:23,478
Heck, you tell your mom,
she high-fives you so fast,

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,147
she doesn't even
take off her oven mitts.

57
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:27,416
But if they had any idea

58
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:30,319
how difficult it is:
the jealousy,

59
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,171
the insecurity,

60
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:37,042
those high-fives would be
high-fives of condolence.

61
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:40,963
Barney, condolence high-fives
are not a thing.

62
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:42,298
They're a thing.

63
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,817
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to let you go.

64
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,519
Up top.

65
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:52,024
Ah, listen to me
and my boring couples' problems.

66
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:53,442
How are you?

67
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:54,877
How's the single life?

68
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,179
I wouldn't know.
After this whole Robin thing,

69
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,198
for the time being,
I'm laying low.

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,616
Laying low as in

71
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:03,235
sleeping with a really
short chick? (wry chuckle)

72
00:03:03,237 --> 00:03:04,519
You guys doing 39?

73
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,405
I mean, I'm not seeing anyone.

74
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,124
I'm just, you know, trying
to get Robin out of my head.

75
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,627
You need a palate cleanser.

76
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,245
Barney, please,
don't try to set me up

77
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:15,414
with Quinn's stripper friends.
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

78
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,733
Why not, how many hints
do I have to drop?!

79
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:20,886
No, I'm thinking of something
much more traditional.

80
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:23,705
Online dating.
Yeah, no thanks.

81
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:25,724
Come on, Ted! It's 2012.

82
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:28,727
What do you expect,
to meet some cute travel agent

83
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,313
when you're reading a newspaper
at a bookstore?

84
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:33,315
None of those things
exist anymore.

85
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:36,218
Barney, I will never, ever,

86
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,054
ever, try online dating.

87
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:40,906
NARRATOR: <i>That night</i>
<i>I tried online dating.</i>

88
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:44,076
<i>And kids, the first girl</i>
<i>I found was amazing:</i>

89
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:48,330
<i>beautiful, smart, funny, huge</i>
<i>fan of prewar architecture,</i>

90
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:51,266
<i>favorite poet Neruda,</i>
<i>favorite movie</i> Ghostbusters,

91
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:53,235
and she didn't hate Cleveland.

92
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:55,170
She's perfect.

93
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:56,905
<i>So I sent her an email,</i>

94
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:59,942
<i>inviting her to mini golf.</i>

95
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:01,377
(typing)

96
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,630
(phone rings)

97
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:07,216
Hello.
BARNEY: Mini golf?

98
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:09,218
Mini golf? Who takes
a first date to mini golf?

99
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,386
I'm coming over!

100
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,939
Oh, Ted-Ted-Ted-
Teddy-Ted-Ted.

101
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:14,620
Who buzzed you in?

102
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,645
Did you really think you
could start dating online,

103
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:17,776
and I wouldn't find out?

104
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:21,280
But with thi-this
girl, sh-she was...

105
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:23,198
Me. She was me, Ted.

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,068
The photo was just of some girl
I knew you'd never seen before,

107
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,454
a very famous sports anchor
on ESPN.

108
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:32,491
Barney, I don't need you to
help me find a girl online.

109
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,776
Exactly because I've
already done it!

110
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:36,328
Three girls in fact.

111
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,580
I scoured the dating sites

112
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,749
using my own personal
logarithms,

113
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,085
factoring in a broad
spectrum of variables,

114
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,587
filtering out undesirable
high-risk negatives,

115
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,307
guaranteeing a success
rate of 83...

116
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,292
You picked the girls
that showed the most boob.

117
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:52,561
My methods get results.

118
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:55,064
Go out with
these three girls,

119
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,932
and your palate is going
to be so cleansed,

120
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,434
you will see
your reflection in it.

121
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,069
And when you do,

122
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,905
you can fix the hair, because...
Have you seen yourself?

123
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:05,274
No, but you know
what I have seen,

124
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:07,910
your stripper
girlfriend's cans. Wow.

125
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:09,027
Wow.
Wow, wow.

126
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,996
That was going way
too far, wasn't it?

127
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:12,498
I'm sorry.
(sighs)

128
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,583
My condolences.

129
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,086
Come on.

130
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:22,657
Man, Marshall's really
stressing out about this baby.

131
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,126
He's reading every book,

132
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:26,295
watching breast-feeding
documentaries.

133
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:29,515
I woke up the other day,
he had swaddled me.

134
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:33,001
Sure, it was the best night's
sleep I had had in months,

135
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,520
but still...

136
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:36,221
You know
what his latest thing is?

137
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:39,525
(antique car horn blaring)

138
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,527
What the hell is that?

139
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,281
(groaning)

140
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:48,901
Marshall,
what is that?

141
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,487
I rigged this alarm
to go off every three hours.

142
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,522
I'm training myself for the

143
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:56,191
sporadic sleep patterns
of early parenthood.

144
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:57,242
Now, if you'll excuse me,

145
00:05:57,244 --> 00:06:00,646
I have a practice-baby
to soothe.

146
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,000
You got to talk to him.

147
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,002
Yeah, I'll talk
to him tonight.

148
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:08,804
Maybe tomorrow morning.

149
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:09,871
One last swaddle?

150
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:10,973
It's just so cozy.

151
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,559
It's like sleeping
in a warm burrito.

152
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:15,561
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Barney was about to have</i>

153
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:17,312
<i>a stripper's boyfriend's</i>
<i>worst nightmare.</i>

154
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:18,847
Karma?

155
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,382
Oh, my gosh,
I didn't recognize you

156
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:21,883
without your legs
behind your head.

157
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:24,069
Darryl, I didn't
recognize you

158
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,437
without your
creepy trench coat.

159
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,522
How are you?

160
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,407
Great, you working tomorrow?
You know it.

161
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:30,108
Great. I'll be there
with bells on.

162
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,861
And by bells,
I mean super thin sweatpants.

163
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:35,113
(both laugh)
Gross.

164
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:37,866
He's actually a nice guy.

165
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:39,234
She's so busy
as deputy mayor,

166
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,086
but I always get a card
on my birthday.

167
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:44,289
Quinn, I love the fact
that you're a stripper,

168
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,792
but I hate the fact
that you're a stripper.

169
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:49,761
Barney, I like my job.

170
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:51,930
And I do not need
to be rescued.

171
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:54,967
So, don't be that guy.

172
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,268
You're right, you're right.

173
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,554
I got it.
Forget I said anything.

174
00:06:58,556 --> 00:06:59,555
Hmm.

175
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:01,190
I'll see you
tonight, Karma.

176
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:02,891
You got it,
Dirty Larry.

177
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:05,027
You have to quit your job!

178
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,478
NARRATOR: <i>That night, I went out</i>

179
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,530
<i>with the first girl</i>
<i>Barney picked for me.</i>

180
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:09,898
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

181
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,817
Your name is Robin?

182
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,785
Yeah, with a Y.

183
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:16,405
Oh, <i>Yobin.</i>

184
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,156
No, Robin.

185
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:21,276
I go by ScotchAndGunLover
in my online profile,

186
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:23,128
'cause those are
my two favorite things.

187
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,281
Well, next to Canada,
my home and native land.

188
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:29,051
Oh. Canada.

189
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:31,003
NARRATOR: <i>And just like that,</i>

190
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:33,555
<i>Robyn became Robin.</i>

191
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:36,091
How's it going, Ted?

192
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:42,382
Oh, good. Hey, look,
mommy's back from the bar!

193
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,795
Now I can finally take a shower.

194
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,297
(sighs)

195
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,334
This diaper smells.
I don't want to know.

196
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,420
Okay, Marshall,

197
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:54,722
sit down; we need to talk.

198
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,641
(sighs)

199
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,876
Look, I know
you mean well,

200
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,395
but we have five weeks
till the due date.

201
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,182
Can't we use this
time to just relax?

202
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,217
We'll figure out
how all this stuff

203
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,052
works after
the baby comes.

204
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,770
After the baby comes?

205
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,555
Yeah, we'll learn
on the job.

206
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,858
Learn on the j... Huh.

207
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,194
Wow, you know, Lily,

208
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,946
maybe the crisis here isn't that
I'm not ready to be a dad;

209
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:21,199
maybe it's that
you're not ready to be a mom!

210
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,399
Excuse me?!
Yeah.

211
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,901
NARRATOR: <i>With that,</i>
<i>an argument began,</i>

212
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,587
the details of which are still
<i>hotly debated to this day.</i>

213
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,207
<i>For instance, Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>swears he never said:</i>

214
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,654
I'm the only one making
sacrifices for this baby!

215
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:32,125
What?!

216
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,462
<i>And he claims he never</i>
<i>actually uttered the words:</i>

217
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:36,247
It's like you don't even know
that you're pregnant!

218
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,716
<i>While Lily insists</i>
<i>this part was exaggerated:</i>

219
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,618
Baby's are easy; you just

220
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,720
watch them be cute
and feed them spaghetti!

221
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,640
<i>But everyone agrees</i>
<i>this is how the argument ended:</i>

222
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,359
Marshall, what I need now
is some peace, some quiet,

223
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,144
and now that it's out there,
some spaghetti.

224
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:53,364
Now, please help me off
the couch so I can storm out.

225
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,201
(angry grunt): Huh!

226
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,074
NARRATOR: <i>The next day,</i>
<i>I filled Barney in on my date.</i>

227
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,442
Oh, Yobin.

228
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,944
No, Robin.

229
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,746
And for the rest of the night,

230
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,882
every time I looked at her,
I just saw Robin's face.

231
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,418
Well, I should hope so.
No, our Robin.

232
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,786
Robin with an I.

233
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,888
Uh, our Robin has
two eyes, my friend.

234
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,141
But that's good. You're
forgetting what she looks like.

235
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,427
I'm sorry, that must
have been tough.

236
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,680
If anyone knows what
that feels like, it's me.

237
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,682
My condolences.

238
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,237
Okay. Moving on.

239
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,240
The next girl:
perfect palate cleanser.

240
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,575
Nothing like Robin.

241
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,809
How nothing?

242
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,412
I gaze out into the world
and all I see

243
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,982
is an icy place
where dreams die.

244
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,869
Ooh, lasagna.

245
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,339
How's it going, Ted?

246
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,341
What? No. What? Wh-Why?

247
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,459
Remember, I made lasagna
that one time.

248
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,794
That's all it takes?

249
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,297
It wasn't even lasagna;
you took your botched kugle

250
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,848
and poured tomato sauce on it.

251
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,551
I didn't say
it was good lasagna.

252
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:06,203
By the way, what are you doing
with this girl?

253
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,639
With tattoos all up
and down her arms and...

254
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,526
everywhere else.
Hello... good gravy.

255
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,945
Does that dragons tail go
all the way down to her...

256
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,681
(chuckling): Ohh, yes, it does.

257
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,734
Well, what do you want me
to do, Robin?

258
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,535
I have to get over you somehow,

259
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,187
and if this is what it takes...

260
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,139
Are you okay?

261
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,159
Yeah. Why?

262
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,661
You kind of spaced out there.

263
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,496
Weirdo.

264
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,249
"So, in summation,

265
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,634
I'm very, very sorry."

266
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,803
"I guess I just wanted
you all to myself,

267
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,505
"and then I thought of all the
creepy guys groping at your...

268
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,807
"Okay, I'm getting mad again,

269
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,208
"so I'm going to
stop writing now.

270
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,812
Please enjoy these chocolates,
may contain peanuts."

271
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,996
Kiss and make up?

272
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,015
(chuckles)

273
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,052
Have sex up against the window
and make up? - (laughs)

274
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,355
You do have a great view.

275
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,273
Well, funny you
should mention that.

276
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,358
It's <i>your</i> view.

277
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,693
Come again for Big Fudge?

278
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,678
Congratulations. You're hired.

279
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:06,697
You are Goliath National Bank's

280
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,500
newest executive
strategy coordinator.

281
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,336
What is an executive
strategy coordinator?

282
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,422
It's three
corporate-sounding words

283
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,674
which, when added together,
equal a fake job

284
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,126
for which you get
a real paycheck

285
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:21,745
in the amount of exactly
what you'd make stripping.

286
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,747
Plus dental. You're welcs.

287
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,850
Now, about that
up-against-the-window sex...

288
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,635
Dude, I don't want
to work for a bank.

289
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:28,519
Why not?

290
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,504
Because I have standards.

291
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:31,856
You people are whores.

292
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,091
The things you're willing
to do just for some money,

293
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,592
it's shameful.

294
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,928
You work in a strip club.

295
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,864
Yeah, and I like it.

296
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,432
And I'm good at it.

297
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,483
Barney,

298
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:45,236
if I took this job,
you would own me.

299
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,954
I would be willingly
stepping into a cage,

300
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,622
which is something I don't do.

301
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,325
Except on Thursdays, when it's
cage night at the Lusty Leopard,

302
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:52,493
but that's a cardboard cage,

303
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,795
and I can get out of it
any time I want.

304
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,996
You can?

305
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,249
Wow, thanks
for ruining cage night.

306
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,134
- Come on, Quinn.
- No.

307
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:00,835
I wouldn't...
Nope.

308
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,970
Don't.

309
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,122
I think I have
some thinking to do.

310
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,058
I...

311
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,226
Mr. Stinson?

312
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,978
Does this mean
I get to keep my job?

313
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,215
(sighs)
Yeah, Herm, you can stay.

314
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:15,900
Hey, baby, listen.

315
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,968
I'm-I'm sorry I flipped out.

316
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,236
Oh, that's okay.

317
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,522
To be fair, maybe I'm at fault

318
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:23,307
for loving our child too much,

319
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,659
although that is the definition
of parenting, so...

320
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,810
All right, good make up.

321
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,412
Hey, listen, I went online,

322
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,531
and I found
this Baby Boot Camp thing

323
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:33,250
that they're doing at a hotel
in Paramus this weekend.

324
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,502
Baby Boot Camp?

325
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,753
That sounds great.

326
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,037
Yeah, it's a two-day event...

327
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,155
We're going.

328
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,790
...and there's lots
of seminars and classes.

329
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,175
You've already made the sale.

330
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,510
Anyway, I signed us up.

331
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,928
Not even listening anymore;
mentally packing.

332
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,163
I'm trying to figure out
the best way to get to Paramus

333
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,348
without hitting any tolls.

334
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,665
This is gonna be great.

335
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,002
And that was the last time

336
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,772
I'll ever go out with a guy
with a mustache.

337
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,973
(both chuckling)

338
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,224
<i>This is good.</i>

339
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:59,727
<i>This is nice, not thinking</i>
<i>about you-know-who.</i>

340
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,645
<i>Just having a good time</i>

341
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,731
and thanking God I didn't grow
<i>that mustache.</i>

342
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,182
And you,

343
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,518
you're so polite.

344
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,205
My ex-fiancé, Wayne,
he had no manners.

345
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,740
<i>Wayne had no manners.</i>

346
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,575
<i>Wayne... manners...</i>

00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:17,912

<i>who at night would don</i>
<i>the colorful vestments</i>

351
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,420
<i>of the Boy Wonder, aka...</i>

352
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:28,172
(growling): Robin.

353
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,509
Holy long walk for a short drink
of water, Ted.

354
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,510
Stop this.

355
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,512
I need you out of my life
for real.

356
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,063
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

357
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,064
No, you don't.

358
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,882
Look how much is changing
right now.

359
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,185
Marshall and Lily
are having a baby.

360
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,886
Barney's shacking up
with a girl.

361
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,021
With your whole world

362
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,489
turning upside down,

363
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,907
isn't a friendship like this one

364
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,361
something you want to hold on to
as tightly as possible?

365
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,000
And every time I look at you,
it hurts.

366
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,502
...and that's the story
of my only lesbian experience.

367
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,954
I'm sorry

368
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:01,922
for going into so much detail.

369
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,375
I'll never tell
that story again.

370
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,076
Anyway, how's your meal?

371
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,412
Holly, listen,
I should probably tell you,

372
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:12,099
um, I'm kind of getting
over someone right now.

373
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,552
I am so glad you said that.

374
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,087
I guess I'm still
getting over Wayne.

375
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,939
It's been really hard.

376
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,725
Can I interest you
in some sorbet?

377
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,228
You two look like you could both
use a palate cleanser.

378
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,401
(exhales)

379
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,936
How's your palate, Ted?

380
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,121
Pretty cleansed.

381
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,407
(chuckling)

382
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,909
(groans)
You know, at this seminar,

383
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,961
there's gonna be the
one guy who's, like,

384
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,631
Mr. Parenting Expert, keeps
interrupting the speakers

385
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,449
with his own "important facts."

386
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,635
And you're gonna be sitting
right next to him,

387
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,137
so get ready for that.

388
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,673
Baby, you've been a little
sleep deprived lately.

389
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:54,725
Why don't you let me drive?

390
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,628
You know what, that's
not such a bad idea.

391
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,796
I mean, the last thing we want

392
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,233
is for me to get
behind the wheel and just...

393
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,487
(snoring)

394
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,107
(groaning)

395
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,159
(moans)

396
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,945
Oh, baby, you smell good.

397
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,414
When we get to that hotel,

398
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm gonna wear
your pregnant belly like a hat.

399
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,619
BARNEY:
You'll have to buy me

400
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,170
a couple of
cocktails first.

401
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,821
Bar-Barney!

402
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,490
Where are we?

403
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,510
Atlantic City, baby!

404
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,679
Well, in 14 miles.

405
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:36,548
What the hell is going on?

406
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:37,880
And where is Lily?

407
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:40,383
And what did you do
to the practice baby?

408
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:42,718
And is there any left?

409
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,238
Lily was worried about you.

410
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,690
She thought you needed
to unwind, so...

411
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,893
I mean, the last thing
we want is for me to

412
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,329
get behind the wheel
and just...

413
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:55,765
(snoring)

414
00:15:57,785 --> 00:15:59,786
BARNEY: <i>She made reservations</i>
<i>for two deluxe rooms,</i>

415
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:01,237
<i>massages, and dinner</i>
<i>at the Palm,</i>

416
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:04,207
<i>and in return,</i>
<i>I made her cookies.</i>

417
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:09,912
So, there's no Baby Boot Camp
at the Paramus Waldorf?

418
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:13,266
Is there even a Paramus Waldorf?

419
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,717
Bro...

420
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,220
I am so mad at Lily right now.

421
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:20,807
She knew you would be;
that's why she packed this.

422
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,142
Aw.

423
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:25,561
My mad-at-Lily shirt.

424
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,264
I had this made for me

425
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,283
and my high school
girlfriend, Steph.

426
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:32,485
In reality,
"Marshall and Steph 4-eva"

427
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:33,569
turned out to be

428
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:35,405
"Marshall and Steph
for two days

429
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:38,941
until Steph's boyfriend
got out of juvie a week early."

430
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,610
Drives Lily crazy
when I wear it.

431
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:45,081
I hope she's miserable
without me.

432
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,632
(crunching)

433
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,387
Hey, Ted,
how's tricks?

434
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:52,755
Tricks are pretty good, Lou.

435
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:55,958
Had some girl trouble
earlier in the week, but, uh,

436
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,060
I got a feeling from here on
out, things are gonna be A...

437
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,563
O-Oh, you son of a bitch.

438
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:02,932
Hello.

439
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,901
(cheering)

440
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,269
Lily's right.

441
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:07,603
I've been acting crazy.

442
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:08,738
No, it's okay, bro.

443
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,407
I mean, yeah,
you've been a little crazy,

444
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,808
but it comes from love.

445
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,911
It's the same kind of crazy
that makes a man

446
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:18,164
offer his stripper girlfriend
over half a million dollars

447
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,415
of government bailout money,

448
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,200
not to rub up
on other guys' junk.

449
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:22,651
It's good crazy.

450
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:23,986
(gamblers groaning)

451
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,592
I hope Lily's okay.
Okay,

452
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:30,826
you know, that's it, bro.

453
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,661
We're both turning off
our phones for one hour.

454
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:33,763
Motion denied.

455
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:36,682
Okay, you leave me no choice.

456
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:40,520
Proposal: you give me one hour
of phone-free bro time,

457
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:43,306
during which we,
and by we I mean you,

458
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:46,309
get magnificently,
mythologically drunk.

459
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:50,012
I'm talking needing-subtitles-
when-you-speak drunk.

460
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:52,515
If you can give me that,

461
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:55,651
I will wear this.

462
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:56,736
The ducky tie?

463
00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:58,120
I thought you threw
that thing away.

464
00:17:58,122 --> 00:17:59,572
I did.

465
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:01,524
It came back.

466
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,192
All right, Barney,

467
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:05,044
you got yourself a deal.

468
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,996
(chuckles)

469
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,798
(beep)

470
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,083
Um, excuse me, miss.

471
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,418
Um, when you get a chance,

472
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,389
could you bring over a hundred
shots of tequila, please?

473
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:17,990
I'll have the same.

474
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:23,779
Why are you still here?

475
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:25,398
Why do you think I'm still here?

476
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,234
I guess because I'm
in love with you.

477
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:31,554
Why else would I be seeing
your face everywhere I look?

478
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,222
Because you feel bad.

479
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:35,241
Of course I feel bad.

480
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,059
I told you I love you,

481
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:40,696
which is apparently the worst
thing you can say to someone.

482
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:42,365
That's not why you feel bad.

483
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,784
You feel bad because
after you said it,

484
00:18:44,786 --> 00:18:46,435
you let me go away.

485
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:48,671
I know our relationship

486
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,923
isn't exactly
what you want it to be,

487
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,925
and I know I
may not love you

488
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:56,913
the way you love me,
but I do love you.

489
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,766
Isn't that worth hanging on to?

490
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,887
(sighs)

491
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:08,391
I miss you.

492
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,876
So go get me back.

493
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,466
(exhales)

494
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,268
Robin?

495
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,453
Ted.

496
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:21,704
It's good to really see you.

497
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,322
It's really good to see you.

498
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:24,624
Look, I think we need to talk.

499
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:26,993
Uh, me, too,
but now's not a good time.

500
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:27,827
Why not?

501
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:29,912
I am proud of you, bro.

502
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:32,331
You turned off your phone
for one hour,

503
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,749
and you got so drunk...

504
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:35,918
(mumbling)

505
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:40,423
Exactly.

506
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:42,258
Hey, (mumbles).

507
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,593
Yes, Marshall?

508
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:46,178
(speaking untelligibly)

509
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,913
Well, I don't see why not.

510
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:53,753
Whoa! I've got
17 new voicemails.

511
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,104
Barney, it's Lily.

512
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,406
You guys need to get back
to New York right away.

513
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:58,474
I'm in labor.

514
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,809
(Marshall yelling)

515
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,478
All hail Beercules!

516
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,946
(laughing) Yeah!

517
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:05,814
(laughing)

518
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,116
(groans)

519
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:16,353
All right, Barney,
you got yourself a deal.

520
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,590
(beep)

521
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,826
Hey, you've reached Marshall.

522
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:24,377
Please leave a message.
(beep)

523
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,446
Hey, baby, it's me.

524
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:27,981
I think I'm labor.

525
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:31,801
(coughs) We should do this
every weekend.

526
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:34,020
(beep)
Okay, this is real.

527
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,188
It's not a false alarm.

528
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,439
This is real; I'm in labor.

529
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,775
I kind of need you
to call me back now.

530
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:40,860
How does somebody so little

531
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:44,597
have such strong fingers?

532
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,865
Call me!

533
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,785
He is the manager
of the Paramus Waldorf.

534
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:52,539
You come to Paramus,
we will hook you up.

535
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,491
(beep) If you're trying
to get back at me,

536
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:58,398
you have chosen a wildly
inappropriate way of doing so!

537
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:02,393
Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah.
