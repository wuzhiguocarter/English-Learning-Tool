1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,723
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Is it about the bees?

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:05,693
Bees?
We're throwing

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,373
a housewarming party
in two weeks.

4
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:08,196
Oh.

5
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:09,613
It's gonna be friends,
neighbors...

6
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:11,115
Did he say...
did he say "bees"?

7
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:14,535
Yeah. Marshall's been working
very long hours lately,

8
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:17,571
so I have been planning
this whole party by myself,

9
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:20,424
and everything's in place:
the food, the wine.

10
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:23,577
I even found a rare
Gouda on the Internet.

11
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,762
Oh.

12
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:25,963
Getting back
to these bees...

13
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,015
Bottom line: this party
is very important to me,

14
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:32,519
so I can only assume--
and I say this with love--

15
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,921
you're gonna ruin it.

16
00:00:33,923 --> 00:00:36,840
Lily, I promise I won't ruin
your party.

17
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,592
I'll be charming and convivial.

18
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:39,944
A regular Burt Reynolds.

19
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,645
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

20
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,747
Tell us about the bees!

21
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,950
Well, all right,
since you asked.

22
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,284
I'm starting up a business

23
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:49,987
cultivating all-organic,
artisanal honey.

24
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:52,790
That's right,
I'm a job creator.

25
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:55,125
Oh.
So this party...

26
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,961
Oh, Lily, wait.
Um, if you don't mind,

27
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,413
I just,
I have one follow-up.

28
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:02,216
Where are you doing
this exactly?

29
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,135
Downstairs-- there's 10,000 bees
in the basement.

Happy housewarming!

34
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,973
Hey, guys.

35
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:27,140
Robin here has spent

36
00:01:27,142 --> 00:01:29,243
all day learning
how to make kugel.

37
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,028
Couldn't figure it out--
this is from Zabar's.

38
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,696
Can we heat it up
in your oven?

39
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:35,366
Faster than heating it up
in the refrigerator.

40
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:37,501
I've had a few cocktails.

41
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:39,103
I got it.
Take that.

42
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,322
<i>Kids, someday</i>
<i>you're gonna throw a party,</i>

43
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:44,091

44
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:45,876

45
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:47,828
<i>Well, don't.</i>

46
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,465
<i>What you should worry about</i>
<i>is everything going wrong.</i>

47
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:55,302
<i>And what's really scary</i>

48
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,104

50
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,794
<i>Now, a lot happened</i>

51
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:07,781

52
00:02:07,783 --> 00:02:09,850
<i>We'll start in the living room.</i>

53
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,488
Oh, no,
that's not what you want.

54
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,657
- What?
- Oh, nothing. So, you think

55
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,825
this is going pretty well?

56
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:19,126
Baby, are you kidding?

57
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,361
You single-handedly pulled off
the party of the year.

58
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:24,081
Oh, stop it.
I used both hands.

59
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,532
So, what can I do to help?

60
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:28,552
Honey, this is your first night
off in however long.

61
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:31,422
You just relax and keep knocking
back those cocktails.

62
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,923
Mr. Cootes.

63
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,976
Hey, isn't it nice
to finally have a night off?

64
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:38,095
It is.
But tonight is not <i>that</i> night.

65
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:40,213
We're going back to the office
in 45 minutes.

66
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:42,215
But, sir, this is
our housewarming party.

67
00:02:42,217 --> 00:02:44,718
You know,
Mother Earth is also having

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,104
a "housewarming" party, too,

69
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:51,108
only hers ends with humankind
at the bottom of a rising ocean,

70
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,944
passing through the digestive
tract of a stingray.

71
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,580
By the way,
it's a lovely home.

72
00:02:56,582 --> 00:03:00,617
Mr. Cootes,
I know you're a vegan, so I, uh,

73
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:03,954
I got some vegan spring rolls
for you over there.

74
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:06,090
Oh, nummies!

75
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:08,959
You're going
back to work?

76
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:11,845
Sheez, Marshall,
you are as busy as a...

77
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:15,432
Oh, gosh,
what are you as busy as?

78
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,633
Please don't talk about
the bees.

79
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,018
I was gonna say Nicolas Cage.

80
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,304
That guy is in everything.

81
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,422
Let's just put on some music.

83
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,362
I'll, uh, I'll bring out
the Gouda,

84
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:30,764
we'll open a couple bottles
of wine...

85
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,232
that are in the basement.

86
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,251
All right, I'll get
my beekeeper's suit.

87
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:35,903
You should be happy
about the bees.

88
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:37,437
They're keeping
the mice at bay.

89
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,438
We have mice?

90
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,957
Not with all these bees

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,208
flying around, we don't.

92
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,160
You're welcome.

93
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:46,663
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out. Look alive.

94
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,419
Are you a vegan?

95
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,837
What?

96
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,339
Ooh-ee!

97
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:58,092
Kitchen, now.

98
00:03:58,094 --> 00:04:01,345
I can't believe that he's
making us go to work tonight.

99
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:04,982
Are... you... a... vegan?

100
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:06,934
Um, no.

101
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,436
Uh-huh.
And when you were shoveling

102
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,356
the spring rolls down your
gullet, did you happen to notice

103
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,992
a little sign next
to the plate marked "Vegan"?

104
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,643
I think there's
been some mistake.

105
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:19,813
You could have had anything
on that table!

106
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:21,532
Anything at all!

107
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:25,085
Mini pizzas,
bacon-wrapped figs,

108
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,453
pigs in blankets.

109
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,338
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

110
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,958
But no, no, you had to have
the one thing

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,627
that someone with my dietary
preferences can eat.

112
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,629
Look, I didn't eat
the spring rolls.

113
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,464
Liar!

114
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:40,484
Your breath reeks of shredded
carrots and deceit!

115
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,174
Okay, okay, maybe I did eat
your precious spring rolls.

116
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,275
Oh...

117
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,844
What are you gonna do
about it, <i>hippie?</i>

118
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:55,699
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

119
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:58,152
Young man,

120
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:01,238
are you suggesting
fisticuffs...

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,356
as in with our fists?

122
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:06,043
And feet--
I'm a kicker.

123
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:09,296
Well, well, looks like
I just started eating

124
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,165
white meat again.

125
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:15,669
I will bite and scratch
you like a wolverine.

126
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,704
May I warn you,

127
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:20,974
I have been in
a fight before.

128
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,227
So have I... sort of.

129
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,395
Oh, God.

130
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:28,515
Mr. Cootes. Hi.

131
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:31,218
Did you see that we had
hummus and veggies?

132
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,320
There's hummus and veggies?

133
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,554
Over there.

134
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:37,057
Hey, I'm not gonna let that guy
push me around.

135
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:40,444
I believe it was Sun Tzu
who wrote, "Never give up.

136
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:41,411
Never surrender."

137
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:42,946
Shut up, Ted.
Okay.

138
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:47,918
For God's sake, Lily,
you're pregnant.

139
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,922
For God's sake, Te
Lily's pregnant.

140
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:56,193
Oh, man.

141
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,911
Sorry about that.

142
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:59,763
I don't need
this right now, Ted.

143
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:01,682
I shouldn't do this.

144
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:02,916
- I shouldn't do this.
- What?

145
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,103
This is a bad idea.
This is a bad idea!

146
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:08,939
- What is?
- I should just go. I should just go!

147
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,642
Okay, okay, just tell me
what is going on.

148
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:14,228
I love my penis, Robin.

149
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,530
Oh, Barney, you promised.

150
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:19,032
I do! I love it!

151
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:21,235
If I could kiss it, I would.

152
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:23,954
I'd be lying if I told you
I hadn't tried.

153
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:26,123
I'm not comfortable
with this conversation.

154
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,943
Oh, come on, Robin, it's my
penis we're talking about.

155
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:32,162
- You've seen her-- she's magnificent.
- She?

156
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:35,132
Every penis is a girl, Robin.
Everyone knows that.

157
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:40,220
Like... ships and lake monsters.

158
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,289
And Gouda!

159
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,974
She's a beauta.

160
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:45,225
Oh, Gouda.

161
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,460
Well, I'll be back.

162
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:49,462
Most of me, anyway.

163
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:51,932
- Don't eat that.
- What?

164
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,934
Whoops! Oh, it's ruined.

165
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:56,353
It's not ruined.
Ten second rule.

166
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:59,239
Eight, nine, ten,
and it's ruined.

167
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,158
This whole party's
ruined.

168
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,144
I got a basement
full of bees,

169
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,496
and Ted almost got into a fight
with Mr. Cootes.

170
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:08,165
Lily, look around.

171
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,816
Everyone's having
an amazing time.

172
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:11,018
It's a great party.

173
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,838
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

174
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:21,528
What the hell was that?!

175
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:30,730
<i>So that's what happened</i>
<i>in the living room.</i>

176
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:35,110
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you what</i>
<i>happened in the dining room.</i>

177
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,524
Oh, no, that's not
what you want.

178
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,429
Man, I can't believe
these are vegan.

179
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:43,663
I've had, like, 20 of 'em.

180
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:45,915
I should get the name
of this caterer.

181
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,385
It's my kitten's
Bat Mitzvah next week.

182
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,837
She's finally
becoming a cat.

183
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,872
Oh, God, you are crazy.

184
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,974
About cats.

185
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:58,544
Cats are so honest and real
with their affections.

186
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,763
Ever since my divorce,

187
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,564
it's just been one liar
after another.

188
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,884
That's why it's so refreshing
to meet someone honest like you,

189
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,720
Special Agent Gary Powers.

190
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,105
Listen...

191
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:12,776
I think we can agree
there's something here.

192
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:14,861
Something big...

193
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:18,865
that looks
and probably feels real.

194
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,251
Maybe...

195
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:22,952
we can go back
to your place.

196
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,905
I can't ask you to delay
intercepting those asteroids.

197
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:28,258
I do need to intercept
those asteroids.

198
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,126
I think we need
to have sex right now.

199
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,247
Meet me in the upstairs guest
bedroom in two minutes.

200
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,602
I'm just looking
for the vegan spring rolls.

201
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:40,970
Last one, sorry.

202
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:42,388
Two minutes.

203
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,808
How can they all be gone?
The party just started.

204
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,942
I know, right?

205
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:48,278
Let's just put on
some music.

206
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,596
♪

207
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,232
I'll, uh, I'll bring out
the Gouda,

208
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,433
we'll open a couple of bottles
of wine...

209
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,035
that are in the basement.

210
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,370
Some jerk was just here.

211
00:08:57,372 --> 00:08:58,705
And he was all, like,

212
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,240
"I can't believe
these are vegan.

213
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:01,407
I've had, like, 20 of 'em."

214
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,627
Point me into the direction
of this scoundrel.

215
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,380
Um... it was
that guy.

216
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:10,233
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out. Look alive.

217
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:15,221
Lily, these spring rolls...
ooh-ee!

218
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,590
Kitchen, now.

219
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:20,727
I can't believe that he's
making us go to work tonight.

220
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:22,595
I mean, I think it's time
that somebody took him aside

221
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,764
and told him this is not
how you treat your staff.

222
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:28,017
Well, I'm sort of busy
with the party right now.

223
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,136
Fine. I'll do it myself.
But he's gonna scream at me,

224
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:31,821
and you know that I can't
stand up to screaming.

225
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:34,140
Just go talk to him!
I think I should go talk to him.

226
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,161
Barney...
Ah, Lily,

227
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:40,363
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

228
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:42,582
You could have had
anything on that table!

229
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:46,085
Mini pizzas,
bacon-wrapped figs,

230
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,120
pigs in blankets.

231
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:50,156
There was even talk
of an inbound Gouda!

232
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,158
Robin. Okay, listen,
I need your help.

233
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,294
I'm about to get in
a screaming match with my boss,

234
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:55,828
and I'm not good at getting
screamed at,

235
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,347
so I need you to warm me up.

236
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,132
How?
I want you to scream at me.

237
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,351
You know, like you do
to strangers on the street

238
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:02,769
at the slightest provocation.

239
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,137
I don't do that.

240
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,772
Come on, lay some of that
classic Scherbatsky

241
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,273
mean son of a bitch on me.

242
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,809
Treat me like I'm a Girl Scout
trying to sell you cookies.

243
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,895
Four dollars a box
and you're out of Thin Mints?!

244
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:15,315
You green little...!
I don't do that!

245
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:16,816
Come on, scream at me.

246
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:19,068
Like that.

247
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,286
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

248
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,622
Marshall, there is plenty
of stuff

249
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,574
that I don't get mad about,

250
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:26,859
like the fact that you're
serving pigs in blankets

251
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,694
without hot mustard.

252
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,664
I'm not the type of person
to be driven crazy by a host

253
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,050
who refuses to provide
delicious hot mustard

254
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:35,969
in which to dip
my pigs in blankets!

255
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,037
I'm the type of girl who...
keeps her cool.

256
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,006
Who keeps her cool.

257
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,043
Wait. Whoa, baby,
are you okay?

258
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,212
Of course.
This party is great.

259
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:49,699
I am handling this.
Oh, God.

260
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,103
No...

261
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:55,355
Hummus and veggies?

262
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:58,074
I'm looking for
hummus and veggies.

263
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,743
Robin, can I talk to you about
something very dear to me?

264
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,612
Promise me this isn't
about your penis.

265
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:05,014
I promise it isn't
about my penis.

266
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,499
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,688
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

268
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,178
Sorry about that.

269
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,797
I don't need this
right now, Ted.

270
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,216
I swear, if there's
one more crisis...

271
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:25,101
Well, the bees
escaped their enclosure,

272
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:27,804
but no reason
to "bee" concerned.

273
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,691
No, there is,
we're in big trouble.

274
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,309
What is that smell?

275
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,594
Oh, I doused my suit
with kerosene.

276
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,263
All beekeepers do this.

277
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:39,482
Dad, just take off
the suit right now.

278
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:40,283
All right, fine.

279
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,101
Every 30 seconds,

280
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,287
there's another crisis
that needs to be dealt with

281
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,955
and I have
to deal with it.

282
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:48,708
This is... Oh, God.

283
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,326
This is parenthood, isn't it?

284
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:51,577
So they say.

285
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,162
Okay, it's official.

286
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,548
I thought I could do it,
but I can't.

287
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,083
No, Marshall's always at work.

288
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,551
He's got to go back tonight.

289
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,503
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

290
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:02,805
that's just one crisis
after another.

291
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,124
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

292
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,476
Gouda!

293
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:07,460
God.

294
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,312
Crisis?
Crisis.

295
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,815
- Don't eat that. Whoops!
- What?

296
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,150
Gouda's out, Ted.
Don't sleep on the Gouda.

297
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,351
Wouldn't dream of it.

298
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:17,136
So Lily told me you have to go
back to work tonight?

299
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,855
No, I don't have to go
back to work tonight.

300
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:20,273
Mr. Cootes and I
came to an understanding.

301
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,658
But, hey, what's going on
with Robin?

302
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,609
I called her
a mean son of a bitch

303
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:24,810
and she took it all weird.

304
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,446
- She did?
- Yeah.

305
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:27,630
Crazy, right?

306
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,365
Hey, buddy.

307
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,034
Best housewarming
party ever.

308
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:33,486
Everybody's abuzz.

309
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:34,987
Abuzz.

310
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,539
Oh, good one, Mickey.

311
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,840
But, hey, you're right.

312
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,826
Great party.

313
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,886
What the hell
was that?!

314
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,749
<i>And that's what happened</i>
<i>in the dining room.</i>

315
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,494
<i>Now I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>what happened in the kitchen.</i>

316
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:04,493
Oh, no, that's not
what you want.

317
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,929
Man, I can't believe
these are vegan.

318
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:08,130
Back to our fight?

319
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:09,581
Back to our fight.

320
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,900
I cannot believe you screamed
at that woman at Zabar's.

321
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:13,268
She was trying to cut in line.

322
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,753
She was gonna get
the last kugel.

323
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,971
She was 90 years old.

324
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:18,107
It was probably gonna be
her last kugel.

325
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,942
Sometimes in life,
you have to be assertive

326
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:21,259
and stand up for yourself.

327
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:22,594
You called her a whore.

328
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,062
Who wears that much makeup?!

329
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,030
Old ladies!

330
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:27,149
Who take money for sex. Exactly.

331
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,535
Look, I'm sorry.

332
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,270
If I would've left things
in your dainty, lily-white,

333
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,156
never-ripped-
an-old-lady's-wig-off hands,

334
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:36,208
we would be kugel-free
right now.

335
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,876
Oh, so, what, I'm too nice?

336
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:39,461
You never stand up for yourself.

337
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:41,914
Remember that sixth grader
who kept stealing your lunch?

338
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,750
High school was
a tough time for me, okay?

339
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,335
And that girl was muscular.

340
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:48,003
Forearms like Popeye.

341
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,638
How do you even know about that?

342
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,924
Marshall told me.
He also said that

343
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,342
you had your mom stop making

344
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,893
peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

345
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,628
because of that girl's
nut allergy.

346
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,347
I didn't want to add
to her health problems.

347
00:13:58,349 --> 00:13:59,648
She was already in a wheelchair.

348
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,299
Okay, so what?

349
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,135
I would rather be nice
than be like you,

350
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:05,821
always getting in fights
about stuff

351
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,272
that's not even worth
fighting about.

352
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,473
Disagree.

353
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,993
It's like Sun Tzu wrote
in <i>The Art of War,</i>

354
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:13,028
"Never give up.
Never surrender."

355
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,830
That was Tim Allen
in <i>Galaxy Quest.</i>

356
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:15,981
Whatever, dude.

357
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,000
Your problem is any time
you're faced with

358
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,035
the least bit of confrontation,
you run away.

359
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:22,604
Oh, I run away
from confrontation?

360
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,794
Ted, baby Gouda's
coming out.

361
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,145
Look alive.

362
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,182
Whoops.
Son of a...!

363
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,833
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,552
Maybe that was my fault.

365
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:37,719
You think?

366
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,104
You're right in my snack track.

367
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:41,557
Hey, nice
beekeeper suit.

368
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,676
Do you know that, uh,
most bees are left-handed?

369
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:47,145
Did you know bees hate
the smell of kerosene?

370
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,814
I knew that.
Geez, what do you think,

371
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:50,732
this is my first day
as a beekeeper?

372
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:53,402
Nice. Oh.

373
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:56,071
Is that true about
bees and kerosene?

374
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,689
I don't know.

375
00:14:57,691 --> 00:14:59,074
Barney...

376
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:00,075
Ah, Lily,

377
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:02,244
Ted ate all of the spring rolls.

378
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,079
Barney, that woman
you were talking to,

379
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:05,047
our neighbor Geraldine,

380
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,648
some guy
slept with her

381
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,751
and didn't call her,
so she hunted him down

382
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:14,556
and cut off a certain part of
his anatomy with a cheese knife.

383
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,009
So, whatever you do,

384
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,510
don't sleep with her.

385
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:22,347
It's funny, she is,
um, waiting for me

386
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:24,149
in the guest bedroom right now.

387
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,051
Oh, God! Oh, God!

388
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,570
That was the idea,
but now forget it!

389
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:29,855
Barney, this is a disaster.

390
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:32,241
I swear, if there
is one...

391
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:34,392
It's fine. Everything's fine.

392
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:35,911
Hey, ten second
rule, right?

393
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:40,365
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

394
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,868
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

395
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,420
I know you're pregnant, but
you need a glass of wine.

396
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,238
I got that cheese off
the Internet.

397
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,674
I know you got it
off the Internet.

398
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,008
Why does that
make it impressive?

399
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,094
You know what else you can find
on the Internet?

400
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,795
Zoo animals masturbating.

401
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:55,597
There's one of a walrus.

402
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,748
He's...

403
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,934
Oh.

404
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,981
No...

405
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,203
Excuse me, sir, could I talk
to you in the kitchen?

406
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,782
Mr. Cootes, I am not
going back to work tonight.

407
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,668
Oh, no, she didn't
just say that.

408
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,253
Mickey, could we just
have a minute?

409
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:37,673
Oh, yeah. Sure.

410
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:42,894
Marshall, look, I know
when you started with this firm,

411
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,596
it was all fun and games.

412
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:48,400
The office chair races
were particularly spirited.

413
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:51,737
Until, of course,
Gail went down the stairs.

414
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:53,405
But for one brief moment,

415
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:55,941
boy, did she fly.

416
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:00,028
I'm not here, I'm not here.

417
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,364
Mr. Cootes, you're working
yourself to death.

418
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,816
Just cut loose a little.

419
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:07,285
Have a beer, find a hobby.

420
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,171
Look, son, it's very simple.

421
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:11,990
Um, Mother Earth
doesn't get a night off.

422
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:13,208
Neither do you.

423
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,593
Well, then I quit.

424
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,932
And I don't know
if I can handle a life

425
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,851
that's just one crisis
after another.

426
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:25,137
Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna
give you a little piece of...

427
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:26,471
Gouda!

428
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:27,439
Maybe he's right.

429
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,725
Maybe I do
need a hobby.

430
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,360
Well, hey,
how about beekeeping?

431
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:34,446
Me? No. I-I don't know the
first thing about bees.

432
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,732
You want to know a secret?

433
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,100
Neither do I.

434
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,452
It's not a secret.

435
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:42,487
Let me try this thing on.

436
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:43,872
I'm gonna give you
some privacy.

437
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,707
All right, thank you.

438
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:46,958
Okay.

439
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,410
Hey, buddy.

440
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:50,245
Best housewarming
party ever.

441
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,963
Everybody's abuzz.

442
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,052
Okay, maybe it's not
a total disaster.

443
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,220
Great party.

444
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,484
Oh, my God. Oh!

445
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:13,735
Oh, Mr. Cootes!

446
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,103
Mr. Cootes, are you okay?!

447
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:18,490
That was amazing!

448
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:19,691
Did you see me?!

449
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:22,077
I flew through the air
like a human fireball

450
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,361
and didn't get a scratch.

451
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:24,913
Eat your heart out, Gail!

452
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:28,399
God, I feel so alive!

453
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,001
I want to drink a beer.

454
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:31,119
Oh, yeah.

455
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:32,671
Okay, one beer, coming right up.

456
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:35,424
Oh, and, uh, Marshall,

457
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:39,077
I think we'll take
the night off tonight, okay?

458
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,846
Sounds good, yeah.

459
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:42,964
But I'll see you Monday?

460
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:45,217
Of course.

461
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,218
Yeah.

462
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:51,556
You know, Robin, I've
been thinking about it.

463
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,192
Guess it's kind of nice
you're such a badass.

464
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:57,863
It's pretty badass
you're so nice, Ted.

465
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:04,319
Was I supposed to close
the basement door?

466
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:10,156
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

467
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:17,373
God, this feels
so right!

468
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,791
We're so great together.

469
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:21,260
I want to spend every minute
of every day with you.

470
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:23,129
I never let you out of
my sight for one second.

471
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,797
Not one second, not
one second. I don't!

472
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,099
Oh, God!

473
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,300
My last lover was not like this.

474
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:29,802
He was the worst!

475
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,938
Do you know, he didn't even
come to my cat's bris.

476
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,557
I mean, what?

477
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,925
Well, we showed him.

478
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:37,143
Yes, we did.

479
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:40,262
Let's just say, the
punishment fit the crime.

480
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,730
I can't wait to
tell everybody

481
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:43,282
that we're boyfriend and girlfriend!

482
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:44,433
Let's do it tonight.

483
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:45,785
No, it's Lily and
Marshall's party.

484
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:47,102
We'll wait.

485
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:50,239
We can do it at Mittens
and Mr. Pepper's wedding.

486
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,773
Or maybe something...
