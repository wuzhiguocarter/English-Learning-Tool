1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:03,470
<i>By the fall of 2011,</i>
<i>technology had taken</i>

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:06,639
<i>a lot of the intrigue</i>
<i>out of life.</i>

3
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:11,023
<i>The Internet had everyone's</i>
<i>wall of information.</i>

4
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>Nothing was a mystery anymore.</i>

5
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:20,007
<i>But, kids, there was</i>
<i>a time before that,</i>

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,475
<i>way back in the dark ages.</i>

7
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:23,876
Are you people insane?!

8
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:26,363
The most popular food in America
is the cheeseburger!

9
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:27,847
No way! It's pizza!

10
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:31,067
Are we forgetting about
a certain Mr. Furter,

11
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:32,652
first name Frank?

12
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:35,054
Um, what did every kid
bring in their lunchbox

13
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,223
every day till
grade eight?

14
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:38,891
Pancakes with
maple syrup.

15
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:41,161
Thanks, Canada.

16
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:43,913
We're looking for a food
the average <i>American</i> eats.

17
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:45,398
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh!

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,700
Chinese food.

19
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,169
<i>And then came the smartphone.</i>

20
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:52,339
Hey, remember

21
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,759
when we were arguing about
the most popular food?

22
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:58,044
It's bread.

23
00:00:58,046 --> 00:00:59,796
Hm.

24
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:02,182
<i>And the barroom debate</i>
<i>was dead.</i>

25
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:04,250
<i>You guys are idiots!</i>

26
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:07,053
<i>Okay, not completely dead.</i>
You are seriously telling me

27
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,555
you don't want
to open that envelope

28
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:10,757
and find out if you're
having a boy or a girl?

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,444
Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us
this in case we wanted to know.

30
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:16,146
But we don't.

31
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:18,815
Lilypad and I are just gonna
wait till that baby pops out

32
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,200
and enjoy the big surprise.

33
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:22,902
Look, I have pretended
to be a licensed therapist

34
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:25,071
enough times to know
there is something unhealthy

35
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:26,906
about your not wanting
to find out.

36
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:29,159
- Back me up here, Kev.
- No, no, no, no, no.

37
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:32,495
This real therapist
won't risk upsetting

38
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:36,216
his wonderful new girlfriend by
analyzing her wonderful friends.

39
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:40,053
No matter how mentally
unbalanced they may be.

40
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:41,171
I hear you.

41
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,789
I don't think you do.

42
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,725
We just don't want to
burden our little angel

43
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:49,062
with all kinds of
gender-specific expectations.

44
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:51,765
Boys can do ballet;
girls can play football.

45
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,575
Hell, the Green Bay
Packers have been

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
proving that for years.

47
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:00,490
That would've gotten
a big laugh at a sports bar.

48
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:02,492
Well, I say define
gender roles early.

49
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:04,744
All the other girls
got a pretty dress

50
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,364
and a cake when
they turned 14.

51
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:08,665
Me...

52
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,917
I want to go home, Daddy!

53
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,754
That direction is
nothing but wolves.

54
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:20,510
And 40 kilometers that way
is the mining town of Smithers.

55
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:23,329
I'd take my chances
with the wolves.

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,551
I'll see you in three days.

57
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:31,304
Well, wait, wh-what
am I supposed to eat?

58
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:34,357
Hey, you've got a knife,
the forest is full of animals--

59
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,142
what do you want, a buffet?

60
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:38,061
Papa...!

61
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:41,231
Happy birthday, son...!

62
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,068
Got any thoughts
on that, Doc?

63
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,937
If you guys think I'm going near
that, <i>you're</i> crazy.

64
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,906
Why'd you
emphasize "you're"?

65
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:52,183
No reason.
You're pretty.

Subtitles by Scorpion.

68
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,071
By the way, do you guys want
to come over tomorrow night

69
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,296
for sangria and tapas?

70
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:10,310
<i>Si. Muchas gracias.</i>
That sounds awesome.

71
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:11,928
Great. We're also
gonna paint the nursery.

72
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,814
Oh, and a quick update
on the sangria and tapas--

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,483
that's cancelled.
Mmm...

74
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:17,517
Guess what smooth
son of a bitch

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,219
just picked up
a girl at the bar?

76
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,155
Barney, you're cheating
on Nora already?

77
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:23,590
No, guys, it's <i>me.</i>

78
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:25,391
Janet McIntyre.

79
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:26,576
Struck up a conversation
at the bar

80
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:28,661
while ordering, she guessed
bread right away,

81
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,055
we laughed, it was
a thing, boom, going

82
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:32,229
out tomorrow night.

83
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:35,668
- So, she said yes just like that?
- Just like that.

84
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,858
There's
something wrong with her.

85
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,083
No, no, no, no.

86
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:39,405
Stop it. They
always do this.

87
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,624
Every time I go
on a first date,

88
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,960
they snap right into
research mode.

89
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,428
<i>It started by accident.</i>

90
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,881
Ooh.

91
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,099
Hello?

92
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:52,302
Ted, we did a little
Internet research

93
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:53,603
on your Mia Plumley.

94
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:54,821
We just sent you

95
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:56,222
a picture of her
from six months ago.

96
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:58,208
I don't understand--
is Mia standing behind

97
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,611
this morbidly obese wo...
Oh, my God!

98
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:04,096
They had cookies and cream.

99
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,282
And what you were saying
about how women feel

100
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:08,768
they have to starve themselves
makes so much sense.

101
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:12,121
Ooh, hot dogs. Score!

102
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,324
<i>After that, background checks</i>

103
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:17,243
<i>became standard</i>
<i>operating procedure.</i>

104
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,329
The date with Nadine went great.

105
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:21,214
Unless you guys found something.

106
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:22,799
Are you sitting down?

107
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,784
No.

108
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:30,590
She's wanted in Florida
on crystal meth charges.

109
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:33,510
She breeds pit bulls
for dog fighting.

110
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:35,345
- Also, the FBI...
- What's this link?

111
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:37,397
Oh, she also writes
online movie reviews.

112
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,466
Anyway, she's still married to
a death row inmate convicted...

113
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:43,469
She gave <i>Annie Hall</i>
two out of ten stars?

114
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,772
"Slow and overrated"?

115
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:48,324
Really? <i>That's</i>
your takeaway?

116
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:50,493
It's the Wood Man at
the height of his powers.

117
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:53,446
The way he broke the fourth wall
by talking directly to camera?

118
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:55,331
People have been
ripping that off ever since.

119
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,952
Can you believe this guy?

120
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:00,420
Paula Vincenzo.

121
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:01,871
She's in the bathroom.

122
00:05:01,873 --> 00:05:02,822
What's wrong with her?

123
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,791
Total psycho.
Her Facebook wall

124
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:07,994
has a link to a site about
dating inanimate objects.

125
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:09,996
For most of last year,
she was engaged...

126
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:12,348
to a mini fridge.
And there's pictures:

127
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,384
her and the mini
fridge on a hike,

128
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:16,436
her and the mini fridge
in wine country,

129
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,221
here's the mini fridge
meeting her parents...

130
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,973
Run like the wind.

131
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:25,562
So... want to go
back to my place?

132
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:27,614
Yeah, all right.

133
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,296
Well, thanks to us,
you ran screaming from

134
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,521
that freak show, right?

135
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,871
- Absolutely.
- Cuckoo!

136
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,074
So what's the problem?

137
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,125
You need us.

138
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,359
No, I don't, okay?

139
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,844
I don't want a
background check.

140
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:43,913
I want adventure
and excitement.

141
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:45,331
Look, if it's
a choice

142
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,183
between mystery
and history,

143
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:49,218
I want mystery.

144
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,620
In fact...

145
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:52,221
Ted, I wouldn't...

146
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:54,390
Uh, Janet.

147
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:56,593
I have a theory.
People don't get the chance

148
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:58,861
to just discover
each other anymore, so...

149
00:05:58,863 --> 00:05:59,896
here's my idea.

150
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,314
Before we go out tomorrow,

151
00:06:01,316 --> 00:06:04,067
let's not do any prior
Internet research on each other.

152
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,636
It sounds like I'm hiding something
horrible, doesn't it?

153
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:08,104
I'm pretty sure
you're a serial killer.

154
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,388
I'm not. I'm not.

155
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,407
It's just, you know, like,
when my parents met,

156
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,392
they didn't have the Internet--
they just went out

157
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,278
on a blind date
and fell in love.

158
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,163
That's nice.
And they're still together?

159
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:18,247
Right up to the divorce.

160
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:21,334
The point is, I'd love
to get to know you

161
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,636
in person, not on my computer.

162
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:25,588
I like that.
What started out

163
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,007
sounding really creepy
turned out really sweet.

164
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,177
That's kind of my move.

165
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:32,629
And she was

166
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,831
on board with the whole
"no Internet" thing?

167
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,799
She loved it.

168
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:38,935
The bitch is
hiding something.

169
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,803
The bitch is totally
hiding something.

170
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:46,448
Hey, Ted, before you leave--

171
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,267
is Janet McIntyre
M-A-C or M-C?

172
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:51,303
For the last time,
I don't want to know

173
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,904
anything about her
before the date.

174
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:55,824
You might want to see this,
Ted-- naked pictures.

175
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:57,659
That's not Janet.

176
00:06:57,661 --> 00:06:59,444
Who, now?

177
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:01,213
Seriously...

178
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:04,332
if you guys respect
me as a friend...

179
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,884
stop looking.

180
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,724
Well, Ted was pretty
clear there, so...

181
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:13,958
let's shut those laptops

182
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,461
and go help Lily and Marshall,
just like we promised.

183
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:17,929
Let's leave

184
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,483
the laptops here
and go paint that baby room.

185
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,836
Without laptops.

186
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,488
Or bring the laptops.
Either way.

187
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,973
This is exciting.

188
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,475
I give you...

189
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:33,328
the color our child
will grow up with.

190
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,581
Yellow, like the sun.

191
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,317
Or daughter.
Pun snuggle.

192
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,205
Oh, God, this room's about
to get its first spit-up.

193
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:45,340
Just open the envelope already!

194
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:47,592
Kevin, will you please
tell Barney that it is

195
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:50,428
perfectly normal for us to want
to preserve the mystery.

196
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,931
I'm not here to analyze; I'm
here to win boyfriend points.

197
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,884
By the way, you all
look great, especially Robin.

198
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:58,019
Come on, if you don't
know the gender,

199
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:00,555
you're gonna get generic crap
at the baby shower.

200
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:02,440
But if you do know the gender,

201
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:05,310
you'll get, oh,
I don't know, this!

202
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:06,862
Marshall! Lights!

203
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,698
Okay.

204
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:14,302
When little Jack's
not turning double plays,

205
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:16,087
he's turning heads with this

206
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,139
home run of an outfit!

207
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:20,158
And if it's a little girl...

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,695
This royal ensemble
may leave <i>you</i> speechless,

209
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:25,330
but it's sure to make
little Sally say,

210
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:28,550
"I wuv you, Mommy,
and I wuv my dress,

211
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:32,204
and I would love
to see you in the shower."

212
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:34,556
Sorry, I kind of fell out of
character in that last part.

213
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,576
But if you don't
know the gender...

214
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:41,096
Little Fran is sure to be
the pariah of the playground

215
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:44,366
in this hermaphroditic
burlap sack.

216
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:46,468
♪ ♪

217
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,936
Marshall! Lights!

218
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,573
Barney,

219
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:54,025
you don't really care abo'.

220
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:54,776
No. You just

221
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:55,760
can't stand

222
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:57,329
not knowing something.

223
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:59,281
That's ridiculous!

224
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:00,999
Marshall, will you...

225
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,517
will you hold
these for a second?

226
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,618
Yeah, sure. Why?

227
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,453
Because I gots to know!

228
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:07,505
Oh, Barney, no!
Help! Get him off of me!

229
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:10,125
Everybody hold it!
Hold it!

230
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:13,211
I found Janet McIntyre,
who's been widowed three times.

231
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,297
She's obviously
killing her husbands!

232
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,933
Oh, my God!

233
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,551
They're six minutes
into the date.

234
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:21,886
Ted's probably already told her
that he loves her!

235
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:23,438
We've got to get down there!

236
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,225
Nobody's going anywhere!

237
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:28,259
Why?!

238
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,778
<i>Kids, at that moment,</i>

239
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,763
<i>Kevin thought back</i>
<i>to his earlier rule...</i>

240
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:34,115
This real therapist
won't risk

241
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:36,267
upsetting his wonderful
new girlfriend

242
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,436
by analyzing her
wonderful friends.

243
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,138
<i>...and threw it out the window.</i>

244
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,374
You're all the most
codependent, incestuous,

245
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,709
controlling group of
people I've ever met!

246
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,497
By the way, you all look
great, especially Robin.

247
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,616
Oh, mm-mm.

248
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:56,254
This is so great.

249
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:58,122
Right? See, if we'd
researched each other,

250
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:00,225
we'd both be secretly
steering the conversation

251
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:01,559
one way or the other.

252
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,978
But this is
more exciting, right?

253
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,095
Way more exciting.

254
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:06,147
I mean, we can talk
about anything we want.

255
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,483
Anything.

256
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:12,970
So...

257
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:16,191
...how was the traffic
getting here?

258
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,243
You picked me up
at my apartment.

259
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,695
I certainly did.

260
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,198
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

261
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,983
<i>I've lost the ability to talk</i>
<i>to girls without the Internet.</i>

262
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,420
<i>My brain is</i>
<i>completely shutting down.</i>

263
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:30,988
So, are you folks gonna have
dinner or just drinks?

264
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,991
I-I don't know.

265
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,295
What the hell
was that, Kevin?

266
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:38,513
We're all crazy just because

267
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:40,015
I'm looking up some stuff
on the Internet,

268
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,999
and Barney wants
to know the baby's gender?

269
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,602
Well, to be honest,

270
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,771
I noticed some
other disturbing...

271
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:49,507
Never mind.

272
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:50,892
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

273
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:52,527
I gots to know!

274
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,863
Okay, last night alone...

275
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:57,282
When-When are you coming back?

276
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:59,701
Because I miss you, silly!

277
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,455
Wait, who's he talking to?

278
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:05,623
Shh, I'll be back soon.

279
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,525
Yeah, you want me
to bring you a pretzel?

280
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:12,297
Ted's texting me
from the bathroom.

281
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,500
Oh.

282
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:16,668
I don't get it.

283
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,887
- It's just a "C" with an apostrophe.
- Oh.

284
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:19,921
Oh, yeah.

285
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:22,340
Sometimes when one
of us is on the can,

286
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:24,893
we'll, uh, sneak a peek
and then text each other,

287
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,895
you know.

288
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:30,548
Symbols to describe what your
bowel movement looks like?

289
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:35,937
This morning,
I took an ampersand.

290
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,555
Last summer,
I dropped a deuce

291
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:39,824
that actually looked
like the number two!

292
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,663
When you worked
late Wednesday,

293
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:49,834
I... I got
lonely and...

294
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:53,070
I watched <i>Survivor</i>
without you.

295
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,175
Practically the only unhealthy
behavior I didn't see

296
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:59,794
from you people
was physical violence.

297
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,386
Yeah.

298
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:09,804
At least we don't do that.

299
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,223
And to top it off,

300
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:14,058
all the meddling
in Ted's love life,

301
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,426
not to mention Lily's pregnancy?

302
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:18,763
It all strikes me as
just deeply dysfunctional.

303
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,950
So what you're saying is,
we're fine?

304
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,655
So, while this font is often

305
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,624
mistaken for Helvetica,

306
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:33,077
the fact is...

307
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,880
it's Helvetica Bold.

308
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:38,616
<i>I can actually hear the sound</i>

309
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:41,352
<i>of her vagina being boarded up.</i>

310
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,556
I got to be honest, Janet.

311
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:47,642
First of all...
this is Times New Roman.

312
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,961
Second, I'm having trouble

313
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:51,930
coming up with things
to talk about.

314
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,798
You? I'm sitting here thinking,

315
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,018
"Damn it, I wish I had something
as good as that font thing.

316
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,486
That's gold."

317
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,522
Guys, I'm so sorry
I said anything.

318
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:04,108
Um, you basically called
my friends mentally ill.

319
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,611
Yeah, you think some lame
apology will fix that?

320
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:09,330
What if I just paint the rest
of the room by myself?

321
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:11,749
Apology accepted.

322
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,117
Okay, let's do this.

323
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,752
Let-Let's find out
each other's likes and dislikes.

324
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:15,954
Start with something
totally random.

325
00:13:15,956 --> 00:13:17,539
Like, um, oh, I don't know.

326
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,324
Are you a fan of--
I don't know--

327
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:22,343
<i>Annie Hall?</i>

328
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:25,296
I'm guessing that's not random
at all, and you use that movie

329
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:27,215
to test whether a girl is cool?

330
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:28,933
No, it's-it's the first movie
that popped into...

331
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,635
I love <i>Annie Hall.</i>
Oh, thank God you're cool.

332
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,470
<i>But just as things started</i>

333
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:34,522
<i>to go well</i>
<i>with Janet McIntyre...</i>

334
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:36,808
Whoa. I just found
Janet McIntyre.

335
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,027
<i>The</i> Janet McIntyre.

336
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:49,070
Sweet... mother... of God!

337
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,995
Uh, well, I got to
run to the restroom.

338
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:59,080
No internet, Mister.

339
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:00,865
If you find out my deep, dark
secret, I'll have to kill you.

340
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,417
It's just my friends
checking up on me.

341
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:04,419
I'll politely let them know
we're having a lovely time.

342
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:05,870
Okay.

343
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:09,757
Ted says, "I'm not clicking on
the link, so leave me alone."

344
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,427
And then either texted me a
bunch of symbols for profanity,

345
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:13,544
or got food poisoning

346
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:15,546
and dropped the weirdest deuce
of all time.

347
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:17,649
You guys have
to see this.

348
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,484
No. We're with
Ted on this.

349
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,385
We don't want to
find out about Janet,

350
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:24,055
just like we don't want to
find out about the baby.

351
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:25,406
Because we like mystery,

352
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,492
whether it's the hairy
majesty of Bigfoot,

353
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:30,528
or the bloodsucking ferocity
of the Chupacabra,

354
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,363
or the gender
of our little miracle.

355
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:33,698
Thanks for putting
those together

356
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,066
in the same
sentence, sweetie.

357
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:36,417
Mm.

358
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:39,120
Look, if you guys don't want
to know, how about this?

359
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:41,706
Let me look,
and I won't tell you.

360
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,508
Absolutely not.
Fine.

361
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,543
Baby, if it will shut him up,

362
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:46,628
what's the harm?

363
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,682
Can I...?

364
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:57,805
This may have been a mistake.

365
00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:59,557
Boy!

366
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,925
Do I like babies!

367
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:02,477
Girl!

368
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:04,112
...friend,

369
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,930
your hair looks
fantastic!

370
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,149
Twins!

371
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:10,401
was the feel-good movie of 1988.

372
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:13,037
Okay, Barney, hey, it doesn't
matter what you guys say.

373
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,238
We're not gonna cave.

374
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,573
Yes, we are!

375
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,558
Oh, just open
your eyes.

376
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,044
This gender-neutral
yellow is horrible!

377
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:22,580
We're clearly gonna paint
over the whole thing!

378
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:24,615
That's what you want to hear.

379
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:26,050
I gots to know!

380
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,719
Yeah.

381
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:30,138
"It's a..."

382
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,056
It's a...

383
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,725
Where is the rest
of the card?

384
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,476
I ripped it in half.

385
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:37,461
I knew you'd be
desperate to see it,

386
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:38,763
and I'll give it to you.

387
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:41,933
All you have to do is admit
that mystery is stupid

388
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:45,403
by reading
about Janet McIntyre.

389
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:47,138
This is in no way
emotional extortion.

390
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,523
You guys are great.

391
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,658
Fine, we'll look
at your laptop.

392
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,445
Sweet...

393
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:57,081
mother... of God.

394
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,335
I can't really see
the computer screen.

395
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:02,370
It just went down
the wrong pipe.

396
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,758
<i>Whoa.</i>

397
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,043
<i>If Lily and Marshall want me</i>
<i>to click on it,</i>

398
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:11,846
<i>maybe Janet really does have</i>
<i>a deep, dark secret.</i>

399
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,265
What's going on?

400
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:15,433
I'm a prostitute.

401
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:16,351
You didn't think I was

402
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,468
actually into you, did you?

403
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,886
Sort of.

404
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:23,174
<i>Get it together, Mosby.</i>

405
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:27,078
Oh.

406
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,347
You don't buy beer,
you rent it.

407
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:31,783
Am I right?

408
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,201
This is the
men's room.

409
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:34,786
I know.

410
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:35,753
I'm a dude.

411
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:48,132
Listen, there's something
you should know.

412
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,385
I lied.

413
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:52,220
I only kind of liked <i>Annie Hall.</i>

414
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:59,260
<i>I gots to know!</i>

415
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,716
Sweet...

416
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,436
mother... of God.

417
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,694
Hey.

418
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,922
Ted, are you okay?
You look freaked out.

419
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:29,558
I'm not freaked out.

420
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,994
<i>I was freaked out. Why?</i>

421
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:34,963
<i>'Cause I had just discovered</i>
<i>that Janet McIntyre was...</i>

422
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:37,199
<i>amazing!</i>

423
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:02,457
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>the wall went up.</i>

424
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,459
Okay, he looked at
Janet McIntyre's

425
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:06,328
Internet
extravaganza.

426
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,347
Here's the other half
of the card.

427
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,138
Wait. Should we
do this? I...

428
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,473
I don't know.
I mean, my soul says no,

429
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:21,026
but these hideous
yellow walls scream yes.

430
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:23,812
Should I just stop, or...?

431
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:26,315
Sweet mother of God!

432
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:29,701
A dog in Ottawa ran all the way
to Saskatoon!

433
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:31,853
What?

434
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,121
We figured out the Janet thing.

435
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:34,456
I'm catching up on Canada.

436
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,861
You're with me on this, right?

437
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:42,697
Otherwise, I can go down,
and I can get the card.

438
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:43,465
Absolutely.

439
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,417
Oh, thank you.

440
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,755
<i>And so the gender</i>
<i>remained a secret,</i>

441
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:53,175
<i>but Janet McIntyre's life</i>
<i>no longer was.</i>

442
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:55,143
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

443
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:56,728
Ted, what's going on?

444
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,264
Nothing.

445
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:01,549
Did I mention
that I'm the youngest architect

446
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,986
in New York history
to have a skyscraper built?

447
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:05,720
Oh.
So, I'm not quite

448
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:08,240
as far beneath you
as you might think.

449
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:10,275
Why would I think that?

450
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:12,694
No reason, but this one time
in sixth grade,

451
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:15,664
I saw a raccoon trapped
in a gutter, and I told my dad,

452
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,532
and the firemen came
and got it out,

453
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:20,502
so it's not like I pulled a baby
from a creek or anything,

454
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:21,753
but at least
I didn't ignore it

455
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:24,673
and keep lighting bugs on fire
with my magnifying glass.

456
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,792
We had one promise,
and you broke it.

457
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:28,660
What are you talking about?

458
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,578
You looked me up, and now
you find me intimidating.

459
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,848
Why-Why would I find you
intimidating, okay?

460
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,083
It's not like
I donated a kidney,

461
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,351
but I donated blood once,

462
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:37,585
although I wound up fainting,

463
00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,721
and they had to put it
all back in.

464
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:41,940
I was so excited about this.

465
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:45,227
But now you're just a blubbering
idiot like the rest of them.

466
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:46,695
No, I ain't!

467
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:49,781
I mean, no, I never do
that thing you says.

468
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:52,651
What I mean is,
you gooder than me

469
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,704
no make difference!

470
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,123
<i>And that's that.</i>

471
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,492
I wish to God I'd never
clicked on that link.

472
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:01,910
I'm sorry, Ted.

473
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,778
We were just
trying to help.

474
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,164
I said it was meddling
and manipulative,

475
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,166
but Kevin insisted we butt in.

476
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:13,255
No, it's my fault.

477
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,806
I never should have looked.

478
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:17,676
In the battle
of mystery versus history,

479
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,644
it's best
not to know.

480
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:22,314
Lily Pad?

481
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:23,849
What?

482
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:26,234
We're having a boy.

483
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,488
We're having a boy.

484
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,805
We're having a boy!
You're having a boy!

485
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,858
We're having a...
we're having a boy.

486
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,359
We're having a boy.

487
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,694
We're having
a boy.

488
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:38,080
I'll go buy
some blue paint.

489
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,550
It needs sharpening.

490
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:54,137
You see? I told you three days
would go by in no time.

491
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,805
Phineas, take us up!

492
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,223
Well, in case
you were wondering,

493
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:59,526
it rained the entire time
I was in the Caribbean.

494
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:03,707
Thank you for asking.
