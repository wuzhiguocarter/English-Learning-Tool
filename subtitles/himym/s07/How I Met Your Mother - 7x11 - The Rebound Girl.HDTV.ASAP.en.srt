NARRATOR: <i>In the fall of 2011,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall received</i>

2
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:05,098
<i>a surprising gift</i>
<i>from Lily's grandparents:</i>

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,850
<i>their house in Long Island.</i>

4
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:10,820
<i>Lily and Marshall decided to</i>
<i>sell it for one simple reason.</i>

5
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,188
It's Long Island.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,574
I don't want to spend
my Saturday in Long Island.

7
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:15,859
I know, babe,

8
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:17,944
but the realtor staged the
place with fake furniture

9
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:20,330
and she wants us to check it
out before the open house.

10
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:21,348
All right.

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,366
Can we at least do it
on the fake bed?

12
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,336
I'm embarrassed
that you have to ask.

13
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,371
<i>So, they headed out</i>
<i>to Long Island,</i>

14
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,274
<i>and when they walked</i>
<i>in the door...</i>

15
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,076
We'll take it!

16
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,427
We-We can't take it.

17
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,262
We're the ones selling it.

18
00:00:36,264 --> 00:00:38,431
We are selling it, right?

19
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,517
Baby, your grandparents gave
you this house outright.

20
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:42,585
So, the way I see it,
we have five options.

21
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:43,686
One: sell it.

22
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:45,889
Two: year-round
haunted house.

23
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:49,926
Three: giant fence around the
perimeter, chimp sanctuary.

24
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:51,260
There's already a tire
swing in the backyard.

25
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:53,563
Four: we destroy it
with sledgehammers.

26
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,281
I like four.

27
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:58,701
Or five: we move in,
raise our children

28
00:00:58,703 --> 00:01:00,770
and make this our family home.

29
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:03,123
Till they graduate.

30
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,992
Then we destroy it
with sledgehammers.

31
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:08,795
(voice breaks):
As a family.

32
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:10,747
No, this is crazy!

33
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:11,998
We are New York people.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,617
We have a big, beautiful
apartment that we love.

35
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,718
You're right.

36
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,120
<i>But something happened</i>

37
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:18,505
to Lily and Marshall that day.

38
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,306
<i>Something that happens</i>
<i>to all New Yorkers</i>

39
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:23,143
<i>who return home from anywhere</i>
<i>other than New York.</i>

40
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,979
Their big, lovely apartment...

41
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:27,847
Huh. That's weird.

42
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,684
<i>...shrank.</i>

43
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,044
(sighs)

44
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:45,347
Okay, after Thanksgiving,
I'm cutting out carbs.

NARRATOR: Now, kids, it had been
a rough couple weeks for Barney.

48
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:06,949
<i>First, he cheated</i>
<i>on his girlfriend with Robin,</i>

49
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,851
<i>then he broke up</i>
<i>with his girlfriend for Robin,</i>

50
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:10,752
<i>then Robin chose Kevin</i>
<i>over him.</i>

51
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:13,038
<i>So he was kind of</i>
<i>in a bad place.</i>

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,306
TED:
Hey.

53
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,424
You all right?

54
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,925
Why wouldn't I
be all right?

55
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,176
Barney's single again!

56
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:20,045
It's what America's
been clamoring for.

57
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,730
You just went
through a break-up.

58
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:23,315
That's usually when people
do something crazy.

59
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,234
If you were a girl,
you'd have cut bangs

60
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,185
and be dating you by now.

61
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:29,187
Just promise me
you won't do something crazy.

62
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,440
I promise I won't
do something crazy.

63
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,092
<i>Don't worry, he's gonna do</i>
<i>something crazy.</i>

64
00:02:34,094 --> 00:02:36,745
In fact, I think
I'm done with girls.

65
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:38,730
I'm not sure I even
like them anymore.

66
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,415
Based on all the stuff you've
done to them over the years,

67
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,500
I'm not sure
you ever liked them.

68
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,368
I'm serious.

69
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,586
Come on, you love girls.

70
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,738
If anyone should be
done with girls, it's me.

71
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,239
Look at the year I've had.

72
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,175
Zoey, Victoria,
the Slutty Pumpkin.

73
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:52,594
Now I'm worried
you're gonna do something crazy.

74
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:54,429
I'm not gonna do
something crazy.

75
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:58,433
<i>And yes, I'm gonna do</i>
<i>something crazy, too.</i>

76
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:00,235
But girls, man.

77
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:01,603
Girls.

78
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:04,189
- You know what would kick ass?
- Being gay?

79
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:06,525
Being gay would kick ass!

80
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,360
Word. Guys understand
each other.

81
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,978
Imagine a relationship where,

82
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,947
instead of talking
about feelings all the time,

83
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:14,432
you just play some <i>Madden,</i>
eat a pizza,

84
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,234
give each other a happy,
roll over

85
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:17,869
and have some
cuddle-free shut-eye.

86
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,237
Bro, for what it's worth,

87
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,491
if we were both gay,
you'd be my first call.

88
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,459
Would you mind calling Marshall
and telling him that?

89
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:25,494
'Cause he thinks...

90
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,112
No, this is only in a scenario

91
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:29,414
where just you and I are gay,
not Marshall.

92
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,949
But if all three of us were gay,

93
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,634
you'd pick me
over Marshall, right?

94
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,436
If all three of us were gay?

95
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,307
Girlfriend, we would
all three of us have some fun.

96
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,342
Damn right we would.

97
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,596
We're not gay.

98
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,848
Nope. Stuck with girls.

99
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,899
(grunts)

100
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,217
I wish men could have children

101
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,736
on their own, like sea horses.

102
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,487
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

103
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:53,488
They have a little pouch.

104
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,906
They should be called
sea kangaroos.

105
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,743
No, y-you want kids?

106
00:03:57,745 --> 00:04:00,979
Maybe I've kind of
lately been thinking

107
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:04,249
about the whole
wife and kids thing.

108
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,034
Just minus the wife.

109
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,652
You could always go it alone.

110
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:09,821
Like Mr. Drummond
on <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

111
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:12,958
Yeah, but that was the '80s,
when you could just swing by

112
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,793
any inner-city playground
in your limo

113
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,178
and scoop up some kids.
- Mmm.

114
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,347
- Simpler times.
- Hmm.

115
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:19,664
I guess it's better
to have someone

116
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,433
in it with you anyway, you know?
Lifetime partnership.

117
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,135
The only partnership in my life

118
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,470
that has stood the test of time
is this one.

119
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:28,306
The sacred bond of man and bro.

120
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:31,009
Maybe we should start
a family together.

121
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,377
(both laugh)

122
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,114
Are you kidding?

123
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,983
This place is huge.

124
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,736
I mean, look, I can
dance all crazy in here.

125
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,371
Oh! Sh...

126
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,374
Listen, um, Robin,

127
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:47,325
are you okay with us all

128
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:49,378
doing Thanksgiving
out in East Meadow?

129
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,912
Uh, yeah, I guess
that'd be nice.

130
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:52,080
Oh, great!

131
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,249
And then after Thanksgiving,
Lily and I were thinking

132
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,367
that we would just
stay at the house

133
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,303
until, you know...

134
00:04:58,305 --> 00:04:59,871
we die.

135
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,089
What?

136
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,674
No!

137
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:05,060
You can't move
to Long Island!

138
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:07,012
But this house
is so nice.

139
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,932
It's big, and it's clean,
and if there's cockroaches,

140
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,518
they respect us enough
to sneak around.

141
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,603
Listen to yourself.

142
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,055
This is Pregnancy Brain
all over again.

143
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,824
No, I'm done
with Pregnancy Brain.

144
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:22,911
I've moved on
to weird pregnancy sex dreams.

145
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,496
Officer.

146
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:27,699
You know. You know.

147
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:32,170
I'm-I'm just saying, you're not
in the right mind to be making

148
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,288
this decision
right now.

149
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,923
You know what? Robin's right.

150
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:38,076
We are in no state of mind
to make this kind of decision.

151
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:40,629
Thank you. And now you're
stepping off the crazy bus.

152
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,180
We let the universe decide.

153
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:43,632
And now you're back on board.

154
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,217
You hear that, Universe?

155
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,553
If you send us a sign
in the next...

156
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,640
24 hours, then we're moving
to Long Island!

157
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,358
Okay?

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,276
Go.

159
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:55,426
ROBIN:
Hey, guys,

160
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,145
for the last time,
this place is enormous--

161
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:58,146
Oh!

162
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:00,532
Geez, how many lamps
do you have?

163
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,784
It's genius!

164
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:05,370
Instead of throwing away
your life marrying some girl,

165
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:08,623
you just go splitsies on a kid
with your best bro!

166
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,708
I wouldn't have to choose

167
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,609
between dating
and having a family.

168
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:14,279
Hell, I could bring
the kids on dates!

169
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,464
And a broken home?

170
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,748
Um, what's that?

171
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,883
Our kids will never know,

172
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:19,450
'cause we're never
gonna split up!

173
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:20,469
Why would we?

174
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:21,887
I mean, sure,
when your wife walks in

175
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,955
on you banging a hot flight
attendant, you get a divorce.

176
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:25,623
But when your bro-parent
walks in on you

177
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,958
banging a hot
flight attendant...

178
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,227
You get five of these bad boys,
right up high!

179
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,147
(laughs) And you totally
join in, right?!

180
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,965
Oh, no, there's the line.
That's the line.

181
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,067
We found the line.
It's good we know where it is.

182
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,102
Hey, guys.

183
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,487
- Hey!
- Hey.

184
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,622
We have an announcement.

185
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,524
So what you're
saying is,

186
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,743
if you're meant to move
to Long Island,

187
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,111
some sign from the universe

188
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,746
will magically appear
at your doorstep?

189
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,865
<i>Now, kids, I don't think</i>
<i>there was a knock on the door</i>

190
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,434
<i>at that exact moment, but for</i>
<i>the purposes of this story...</i>

191
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:54,252
(knock on door)

192
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:57,255
Hi, I'm Clive.

193
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:58,673
I live upstairs from you.

194
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,759
Is this your sign?

195
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:03,795
I don't know, Clive.

196
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,163
Is it?

197
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,015
Oh, did we leave that outside?

198
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,634
Yeah, we're selling our house
in Long Island.

199
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:11,803
Oh. Too bad you're not
selling this place.

200
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,555
I'd love to turn
mine into a duplex.

201
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,673
And I'd give you a really
good price for it,

202
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,742
because I am so rich.

203
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:20,712
He did not
say that.

204
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,113
His shoes did.

205
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:24,449
Okay, the point is,
we got the sign.

206
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,735
We're moving to East Meadow.

207
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:28,570
Let's get some champagne.

208
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:30,238
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall</i>

209
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,873
<i>were beginning a new chapter</i>
<i>in their lives.</i>

210
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,042
<i>Which meant only one thing</i>
<i>for us...</i>

211
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,911
We're having a baby!

212
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,695
Bro-parents activate!

213
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:39,881
(makes explosion noise)

214
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,052
- Hey, let's talk baby names!
- Barney...

215
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:46,903
Oh, my God!
That was my first choice, too.

216
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:50,306
No, listen.
You and I are drunk.

217
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:53,910
Which means there's a chance
that adopting a baby--

218
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,112
no matter how cute
he is in my head

219
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:59,282
with his little cowboy outfit on
and he's riding our dog

220
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:01,834
like a horse
and we also have a dog,

221
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,620
purebred Golden,
but it's okay, she's a rescue--

222
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:06,422
might not be a good idea.

223
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:08,458
You're right.

224
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,594
So let's go home,
take some aspirin,

225
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:13,829
drink lots of water,

226
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:16,883
and then see if it's still
a good idea tomorrow.

227
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:18,801
It's still a good idea!

228
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,386
It's totally still
a good idea!

229
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:21,721
We're having a baby!

230
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:23,306
(both sobbing)

231
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,558
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, I cannot</i>
<i>stress this enough:</i>

232
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,194
<i>Barney and I were going</i>
<i>through a tough time.</i>

233
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:30,513
You're not leaving,
and that's final.

234
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:34,517
Look what I bought at
4:00 a.m. in New York City.

235
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,155
A bootleg VHS of a very,
very popular Korean movie,

236
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:42,024
this genuine Lenny Vintone purse

237
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:45,194
and the number of a man
who can get me a kidney.

238
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:46,579
Do that on Long Island.

239
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,749
Look, Robin, we appreciate
that you want us

240
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,335
to stay in the city, but
this is what we want.

241
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:53,886
I mean, you
understand, right?

242
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:55,204
(sighs)

243
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,305
No.

244
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,890
Here are a
few fun facts

245
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:00,093
about Long Island.
(clears throat)

246
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,812
Number one:
it's Brooklyn's fart trail.

247
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:04,880
<i>So Barney and I--</i>

248
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:06,715
<i>and again,</i>
<i>going through a tough time,</i>

249
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,067
<i>can't stress that enough--</i>

250
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,769
<i>found an adoption agency</i>
<i>Web site</i>

251
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:11,988
<i>and filled out</i>
<i>their online application.</i>

252
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,774
Name: Barney Stinson.

253
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,609
Ted Mosby.

254
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:17,577
Address...

255
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,078
Oh, put my address
in Westchester.

256
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,363
They'll want to see we'll be

257
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:21,998
raising this child
in a good environment.

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,166
You know, the suburbs.

259
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:24,500
What? No.

260
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:27,203
- All my guys are here.
- Your guys?

261
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:29,005
Yeah. You know how I got
a guy for everything?

262
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,289
Well, they're all in New York.

263
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,375
My suit guy, my shoe guy,
my ticket guy, my club guy.

264
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:33,909
And if I don't have
a guy for something,

265
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,711
then I have a guy guy
to get me a guy.

266
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,547
And oddly enough,
his name is Guy.

267
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,415
Okay, fine.
How about this?

268
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,251
We stay in the city during
the week, then on the weekend,

269
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:43,553
country house in the burbs!

270
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:46,055
This is why bro-parenting works!

271
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:46,973
Totally!

272
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:49,225
And with your salary
plus my salary,

273
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,260
we can totally
afford two places.

274
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:53,279
Oh.

275
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,547
What?

276
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:58,818
So... uh, you're gonna
keep your job?

277
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,538
Robin, this discussion
is closed.

278
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,957
The universe told us to do it,
so we're doing it.

279
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,077
Well, the universe
gets it wrong sometimes.

280
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,329
Remember when Marshall
was trying to decide between

281
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:12,915
becoming an environmental lawyer
and working at a bank?

282
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,650
<i>That's a funny story.</i>

283
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:17,086
<i>Marshall was fed up</i>
<i>with his job at GNB and was</i>

284
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,421
<i>thinking about</i>
<i>leaving it all behind,</i>

285
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:20,456
<i>so he and Lily agreed</i>
<i>he should wait for a sign</i>

286
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,308
<i>from the universe</i>
<i>to tell him what to do.</i>

287
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,010
<i>Then one day...</i>

288
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:34,353
Of course.

289
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:35,521
It's so clear.

290
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,240
It's been right there all along.

291
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,974
I have to call Lily.

292
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:41,110
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

293
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:44,163
I'm sorry, but, um, can
I please borrow your...

294
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:46,949
- Ernie Hudson?
- Yes.

295
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:49,085
Can I borrow your phone?

296
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,320
Who you gonna call?

297
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:55,508
And did Marshall
become a Ghostbuster?

298
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,577
That firehouse
is still for sale.

299
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,496
Even Ernie Hudson begged you
not to go through with that.

300
00:11:00,498 --> 00:11:01,797
Ernie Hudson is a coward!

301
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,466
(gasps) Oh!
(gasps)

302
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:04,700
Of course I'm gonna
keep my job.

303
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:05,868
Why wouldn't
I keep my job?

304
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,939
Well, I mean,
this whole architecture thing...

305
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,557
isn't it more of a hobby?

306
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,025
Excuse me?

307
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,644
And now we're fighting.
You know what?

308
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,295
Forget I said anything.

309
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,731
No! No, no, no.
We're having this discussion.

310
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,015
Architecture
is my life's work.

311
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:21,951
Why don't you quit <i>your</i> job?
I don't even know

312
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,703
what it is
you do for a living.

313
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:26,122
"What it is I do for a living?"

314
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:31,244
I work, Ted, 14 hours a day
so that our baby can have food

315
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:33,496
and clothes and a nice house,

316
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,364
while you sit around
doodling pictures of buildings.

317
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:36,883
That's "what it is I do."

318
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:39,502
You know what? Screw this.
I'm gonna go to the bar.

319
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:41,304
Yeah, right, right,
'cause the answer's always

320
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:43,172
at the bottom of a bottle!

321
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,975
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold it!

322
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,928
Brainstorm.
Brainstorm.

323
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,664
Nobody quits their job.

324
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,765
We get a nanny.

325
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:53,766
Dibs on the nanny.

326
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,151
No. No banging the nanny.

327
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:57,186
Ted, please don not dig in
on this whole

328
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,237
no-banging-the-nanny policy.

329
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,822
Okay, fine.
We'll get two nannies.

330
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,241
One for banging,
one for childcare.

331
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,226
Slash banging.
Dibs on both nannies!

332
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,362
Just think of it, Ted,
you and me,

333
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,664
living together,
with our kid,

334
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,137
my two hot nannies,
our pet cobra...

335
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:11,748
What?

336
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:14,086
A kid needs a pet cobra, Ted.
Don't be a pill about this.

337
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,422
And we'll have amazing
weeklong parties,

338
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:19,292
and there'll be swords
and ninja stars lying around.

339
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:20,626
NARRATOR:
<i>That's when I realized:</i>

340
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:23,679
adopting a baby with a friend?
<i>Crazy.</i>

341
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:27,583
<i>Adopting a baby with Barney?</i>
<i>Freaking nuts.</i>

342
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,802
I can't adopt a baby with you,
Barney.

343
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:30,853
Why not?

344
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,471
Because we don't even
have one yet

345
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,940
and you're already
a terrible father.

346
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,058
Oh, I get it.

347
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,977
You want one of the nannies.

348
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:39,928
Well, you can't have 'em!
They're mine!

349
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,815
So you're just gonna have
to get yourself a third nanny.

350
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,651
Except dibs on
the third nanny! Good day!

351
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,704
NARRATOR: <i>Which brings us</i>
<i>to Thanksgiving.</i>

352
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,990
<i>Marshall, Lily and Robin</i>
<i>were heading out</i>

353
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,959
<i>to Long Island early</i>
<i>to get ready.</i>

354
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,666
(grunting)

355
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,301
Okay, how is this
even possible?!

356
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:05,221
'Cause how did we even get it
in here?!

357
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,923
(grunts)

358
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:10,292
Okay, I change my mind.
I want an epidural.

359
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:12,561
You guys are crazy.

360
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:14,930
This place is enormous.

361
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,482
I mean, look arou...

362
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:19,185
Have you never heard
of overhead lighting?!

363
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,607
(sighs)
You're right.

364
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:26,192
I get it.

365
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:29,278
This place is great.

366
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,831
Um, excuse me.
Where is the restroom?

367
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,450
Oh. Right there.
Oh, good, great.

368
00:13:34,452 --> 00:13:36,002
I'm just gonna go
in there and...

369
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:39,255
not come out until you promise
never to move away!

370
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:43,509
It's a good thing
we have three bathrooms.

371
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,462
Hey, Barney.

372
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,163
Uh, listen, sorry
about the other day

373
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:50,099
when I said you'd be
a terrible father.

374
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:52,385
You had no reason
to think otherwise.

375
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:53,886
Totally understandable.
I'm not mad.

376
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,021
(knocking)
Thanks.

377
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:56,155
And, uh, let's be honest,

378
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:57,606
we were both acting
a little crazy.

379
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,642
I don't think either of us
is truly ready

380
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:01,176
for the responsibility of...

381
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,729
Daddy's home.

382
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,054
Uh, Barney, uh, where
did you get this baby?

383
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,527
Please.

384
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:15,777
Did you adopt it?

385
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:16,828
Please.

386
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,130
Do you have
a baby guy?

387
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:22,417
Did Guy the guy guy
get you a baby guy?

388
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,151
Ted, we should get going.

389
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:26,504
No, no, no. I'm not going
anywhere with you.

390
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:27,989
For all I know, I could be

391
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,257
aiding and abetting
a kidnapping.

392
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,042
Shh. Bro-daddy's not mad.

393
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:35,680
He's just being a wittle loud.
He wuvs you! Yes, he does!

394
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,832
- This is insane!
- You'll feel better outside.

395
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,717
- Come on.
- No, I can't.

396
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,302
Yeah. Na-na-na.

397
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:44,639
NARRATOR:
<i>But then we went outside.</i>

398
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:45,890
Oh, my goodness.

399
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,892
- What a beautiful baby.
- Thank you.

400
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:50,177
By the way, my friend and I,
we're not a couple.

401
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,146
We are two straight guys
who are single

402
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,315
and we have a baby.
Just so you know.

403
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,618
Look at this sweet girl.

404
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
Hi. I was just telling
this first girl,

405
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:00,455
my friend and I,
both straight,

406
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:02,540
both available,
and we have a baby.

407
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,042
Oh, who is this little angel?

408
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,326
Okay, real quick:
me and him,

409
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,911
not gay, single,
have a baby.

410
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:08,563
We should look
into having a sign made.

411
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,782
<i>Kids, again, we were going</i>
<i>through a difficult time.</i>

412
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,100
But this part was kind of fun.

413
00:15:12,102 --> 00:15:16,671
WOMEN: Aw...!
So cute!

414
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:18,506
This is awesome.

415
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:20,875
Right?

416
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,894
Robin, come out
and talk to us.

417
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,429
I'm not coming out
of this bathroom

418
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:27,048
until everyone stops
acting crazy!

419
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,067
No one is being crazy.

420
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,085
<i>Again, for the purposes</i>
<i>of this story...</i>

421
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:35,773
Ted and I have
a baby. Crazy!

422
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:37,358
What the hell is that?

423
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,662
Guys, this is Hurricane
Stinson-Mosby.

424
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:41,829
Mosby-Stinson.

425
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,165
You named your
baby Hurricane?

426
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,167
That is...

427
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,620
ultimately inconsiderate
to the child

428
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:50,505
who has to live
with that name.

429
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:53,258
Okay, how the hell
does Barney have a baby?

430
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,575
No idea. Super confused.

431
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,911
I'm finding it best
to just sort of go with it.

432
00:15:56,913 --> 00:15:59,180
She's super cute,
though, right?

433
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,432
Wait a minute.
(sniffs)

434
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:05,586
Oh, guh! Hurricane
dookied in her drawers.

435
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:08,973
Ha-ha!
Poopy pants!

436
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,591
She needs
a new diaper.

437
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:12,527
Right. Where do you
keep your diapers?

438
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,811
We don't have any.

439
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:15,229
You don't... Wow.

440
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:19,117
Okay. (scoffs) I guess
I'll go buy some.

441
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,653
You're gonna be a mom and
you don't have any diapers?

442
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,656
Lord, watch over
that child.

443
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:26,391
Uh, okay.

444
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:28,943
Come here, you.

445
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:32,797
So, there was talk
of a cheese plate?

446
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,884
(knocking)
(gasps)

447
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:42,423
Hey.

448
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:44,842
Cheese?

449
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,394
Thanks.

450
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,599
If you don't mind
me asking...

451
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:53,818
what-what is
this all about?

452
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,438
I mean, you are one of the most
strong, independent,

453
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,640
non-locking-themselves-in-

454
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:01,659
a-bathroom-on-Thanksgiving
people I know.

455
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,313
Why-why are you so upset
about us moving?

456
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,783
Maybe I just need you guys
more than you think.

457
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:13,237
Is this about more
than us moving?

458
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,506
This is good cheese.

459
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:18,576
Robin?

460
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,378
Yeah?

461
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,014
Do you think I should've become
a Ghostbuster?

462
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:25,099
I think you made
the right call, buddy.

463
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:29,854
Okay, Ted, I'm not gonna ask you
where Barney got this baby.

464
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,173
But do you have any idea why?

465
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,525
Well, a few nights ago,
we were talking...

466
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:37,729
you know, "We hate girls,
we wish we were gay,"

467
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,513
just guy stuff.

468
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,483
And we kind of
sort of decided to...

469
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:44,035
adopt a baby.

470
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,820
Yeah, that's crazy.

471
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,038
I know.

472
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,039
Is it, though?

473
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,073
Yes.

474
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:50,074
I know.

475
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,542
But is it, though?

476
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:52,543
Yes.

477
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:53,878
Well, so what if it's crazy?

478
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,030
I've been ready to meet someone
to start a family with

479
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,249
for a long time now,
and I keep not meeting her.

480
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,885
Barney is one of my best friends
in the world, we rarely fight,

481
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:03,054
and once we iron out
the whole pet cobra thing,

482
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:04,806
we will be amazing dads.

483
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:06,307
Why shouldn't we try this?

484
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,542
When's the last time
you fed her?

485
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:10,428
She had some root beer
on the train.

486
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,764
Oh, Ted.
And I'm sorry,

487
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,381
but you cannot call
a baby Hurricane.

488
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,017
Actually, her name is Sadie.

489
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:18,236
James, what are you doing here?

490
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:19,771
Did Barney
not tell you

491
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,406
that we were coming
for Thanksgiving?

492
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:22,723
Uh, no.

493
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:25,392
Then he probably also
did not tell you

494
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,278
that he was babysitting
our new daughter.

495
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,247
This is your daughter?

496
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,032
Oh, thank God.

497
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,834
And congratulations.

498
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,568
Thanks. Come here.

499
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,587
Aw...
Aw...

500
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,257
I guess this is good-bye,
Hurri... Sadie.

501
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,794
(whispers): Your name is Hurricane.
Don't ever forget it.

502
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,763
Go with him. Go on.

503
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:46,964
Come here.
That a girl.

504
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:49,100
Hey, Ted,

505
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:51,185
I overheard
your little speech.

506
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,437
It's not crazy.

507
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:54,806
About ten years ago,

508
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:57,775
my best friend and I
nearly did the same thing.

509
00:18:57,777 --> 00:19:01,062
She was single, I was single,
we both wanted a family.

510
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:03,147
It made sense.

511
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:04,699
But now?

512
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:08,152
Every day, we thank our lucky
stars that we didn't do it.

513
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,771
'Cause what she found
with her husband

514
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:12,657
and what I found
with mine--

515
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,959
it was worth the wait.

516
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,045
Hurricane's
a cool name.

517
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:20,882
Isn't it, Tom?

518
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,567
The pet store
was closer,

519
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,302
so I just got her
some wee-wee pads.

520
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:25,803
Oh, I also got this.

521
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,889
It's beef-flavored
and it's good for her teeth.

522
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,892
James! Tom! Hey!

523
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:32,293
Lily...

524
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:33,794
did you get
the e-mail

525
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:36,314
that I sent you
about inviting

526
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:38,766
James and Tom
to Thanksgiving?

527
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:41,802
I sent it to your CompuServe.
That's your main one, right?

528
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:43,488
Happy Thanksgiving, bro.

529
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,472
- Thanks. Hi.
- Hey!

530
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:48,326
Let's go sit down.

531
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:49,827
Hi.

532
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:52,914
All right,
you got me.

533
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,332
James is my baby guy.

534
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:57,702
But these past three hours--
magical, right?

535
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:00,254
We can do this!
Say we can do this.

536
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,956
We can't do this.

537
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,324
Sorry, dude.

538
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,927
We got to wait
for the real thing...

539
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,329
no matter how tough it gets.

540
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:13,082
It gets pretty tough.

541
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:14,935
I know it does, buddy.

542
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,805
I have some time
before dinner, right?

543
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,024
I'm going to go...
I'm gonna take a little walk.

544
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:22,859
All right. All right.

545
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:25,479
(knocking)

546
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:27,430
God.

547
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:31,151
(sighs)

548
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:35,372
- Hi.
- Hey.

549
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,292
(grunts)

550
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,748
Are we still friends?

551
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,716
Hope so.

552
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,530
Good.

553
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,299
'Cause get this.

554
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,384
Ted almost adopted a baby.

555
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,880
Crazy, right?
(scoffs)

556
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,264
Poor guy's going
through some stuff.

557
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,749
He actually tried
to rope me into it.

558
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:02,136
Can you imagine me
being someone's dad?

559
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:04,976
I'm pregnant.
