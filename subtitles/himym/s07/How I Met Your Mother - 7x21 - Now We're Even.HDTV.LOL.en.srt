1
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:04,261
So, how's living alone?

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:05,677
You know, it's interesting.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,812
When I first moved into
my new apartment,

4
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:09,347
<i>I was nervous.</i>

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:13,234
<i>For the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate.</i>

6
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,903
<i>But then it hit me:</i>

7
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:19,174
<i>for the first time in my adult</i>
<i>life, I didn't have a roommate!</i>

8
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:25,229
<i>If I want to walk around naked,</i>
<i>nobody cares.</i>

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,081
<i>If I want to leave</i>
<i>the laundry basket</i>

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:31,119
<i>in the middle of the living</i>
<i>room, nobody stops me.</i>

11
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,171
<i>If I bring home soup</i>
<i>from the deli</i>

12
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>and leave it in the fridge</i>
<i>for two days, nobody eats it.</i>

13
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:39,177
<i>And if I do something</i>
<i>colossally stupid,</i>

14
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,579
<i>nobody ever has to know.</i>

15
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,765
(loud, high-pitched gasping)

16
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,885
People make fun of the guy

17
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:49,304
who stays home every night
doing nothing.

18
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:53,291
But the truth is...
that guy's a genius.

19
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:56,594
<i>Because let's be honest,</i>
<i>sitting around watching TV,</i>

20
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:59,430
<i>drinking beer and eating ribs</i>
<i>alone is what every</i>

21
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:04,385
<i>red-blooded American would</i>
<i>rather be doing at all times.</i>

22
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:08,072
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better
to have someone to share the...

23
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:11,492
I mean, don't you
get lonely without...

24
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:13,611
Yeah, that sounds pretty great.

27
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,425
What's the best thing

28
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:29,978
about dating a stripper,
you ask?

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,962
Nope.

30
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:32,463
Just asked for your drink order.

31
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:34,182
I'll tell you the best thing
about dating a stripper.

32
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:35,149
He'll just have a scotch.

33
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:36,234
Getting to say,

34
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,152
"Hey, I'm dating a stripper."

35
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:39,654
And I should go.

36
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:41,406
Time to make the doughnuts.
(chuckles)

37
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:44,192
More like time to make some
dough sitting on some nuts.

38
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:45,276
(chuckles)
She's a stripper.

39
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:46,277
I'm dating her.

40
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,495
I'm dating a stripper.
Barney wins.

41
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:48,413
I'll walk you out.

42
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,815
Hey, where are
you going?

43
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:52,417
Quinn needs to get to work.
She's a...

44
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,318
I know, a stripper, got it.

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
Hey, taxi!

46
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:56,921
(whistles)

47
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:59,123
My girlfriend's a stripper!

48
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,493
So, Ted, guess where we're
having dinner Friday night.

49
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:04,178
Chez L'Argent.

50
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,596
I am so excited.

51
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:07,632
We've been trying forever
to get this reservation.

52
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,517
Can you hold on
for just one second?

53
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:10,885
What the hell
are you doing?

54
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,053
Nothing.

55
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,972
Did you say
you had to pee?

56
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:15,473
No.

57
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,308
But yeah, I do have to pee.

58
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,194
Man, this kid better be
real freakin' cute!

59
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:23,898
What was that all about?

60
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,867
Lily had a sex dream last night.

61
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:27,184
(bullet ricocheting)

62
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:28,653
Sex dream?
Do tell.

63
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:32,189
I was painting
the baby furniture...

64
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:35,910
(moaning):
Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:39,130
Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:41,582
Hurry up,
before Marshall gets home.

67
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,751
Oh, oh...

68
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,424
Whoa!

69
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:50,425
I'm sorry, baby.

70
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,993
Were you asleep?

71
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,479
All pregnant ladies
have crazy sex dreams.

72
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,265
It's just her hormones
going berserk.

73
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,901
So who's responsible for her
rapid thigh movement this time?

74
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,936
Oh, my favorite was when
she banged George Washington.

75
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:05,389
I liked the three-way with
Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.

76
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,775
Oh, he smurfed
the smurf out of her.

77
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:09,577
Yes, while The Cos
smurfed off in the corner.

78
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,529
We all remember.
But here's the thing.

79
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,899
When Lily has dirty dreams
about other people,

80
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,617
she always tells me.

81
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:17,935
But this time...

82
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:21,923
Sounds like you
had a crazy dream.

83
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,425
What was it about?

84
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:30,014
And then her face turned...

85
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:32,683
<i>vermilion.</i>

86
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:37,088
Just... you and me...

87
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,024
gettin' it on, monogamously.

88
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:45,696
Monoga-me-oh-my.

89
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:48,766
Not the rose quartz
of the slightly embarrassed,

90
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,652
or the tomato red
of the mildly abashed,

91
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:55,406
vermilion, the color
of carnal shame.

92
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:59,460
Can only mean one thing:

93
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,963
Lily dream-banged
someone we know.

94
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,549
Okay, you caught me
vermilion-handed.

95
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:07,969
The truth is, I've spent
the last five years

96
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,671
trying to inception
your wife.

97
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:12,757
That movie only came out
two years ago.

98
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,809
What movie?

99
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,761
You know who I bet it is?

100
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:18,346
Robin.
(gasps)

101
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,231
Already checked.

102
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,682
<i>Lily and I paid her a visit</i>

103
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:23,851
<i>at the new World Wide News</i>
<i>headquarters.</i>

104
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,820
And I'm so excited,
because I've been trying months

105
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:26,804
to get this reservation.

106
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,189
Can you hold on
just one second?

107
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,440
What the hell
are you doing?!

108
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,525
Nothing.

109
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:32,743
Nice photo.
Oh.

110
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:34,779
Your passport
must be enormous.

111
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,414
(chuckles)
Ugh.

112
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,984
You know, for the record,
I didn't want this.

113
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:42,286
Didn't want it,
did not approve it.

114
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:43,371
(chuckles)

115
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,839
It's super embarrassing.

116
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:47,158
Hey, Merle.

117
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,611
So, uh, do you guys
want to come up and see my desk?

118
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:51,879
Yeah, why not?

119
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,431
Come on.

120
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,932
I.D.?

121
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:56,834
Oh. Um, that is me.

122
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,219
(chuckles)

123
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,336
Ma'am, with all due respect,

124
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,639
you're a wee bit older
than that hottie.

125
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:02,607
(scoffs)

126
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:03,858
For God sakes.

127
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,311
You know, here I am,
on national TV every day,

128
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:10,781
and still a guy who spends
his whole life sitting next to

129
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,151
a giant picture of me
has no idea who I am.

130
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:15,403
This isn't my whole life;
I'm in a band.

131
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,671
And we're gonna make it.

132
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:18,906
NARRATOR:
<i>And, kids, they did make it.</i>

133
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,275
<i>But I'll get to that later.</i>

134
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:24,045
<i>You know what, I'm probably not</i>
<i>going to get to that later.</i>

135
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:27,715
<i>They had one song,</i>
<i>it didn't suck, the end.</i>

136
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:30,251
You always said
it wasn't about being famous.

137
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,703
You just want to do
solid journalism, right?

138
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:34,305
Yeah, well...

139
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,507
Of course I want
to be famous!

140
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,875
In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles.

141
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,060
I was a cabinhold name.

142
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,161
But here?

143
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,512
Don't need to see
your I.D., Merle.

144
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,181
Everyone knows
who you are.

145
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,482
You're Merle.

146
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:46,484
He was in one skit
in the Christmas party!

147
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:47,852
(sighs)

148
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:50,221
Uh, by the way,
how is Ted doing?

149
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,006
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, you remember</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

150
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:54,108
<i>I declared my love,</i>
<i>she turned me down,</i>

151
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,827
<i>we both moved out of</i>
<i>the apartment, and now...</i>

152
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:59,363
I haven't talked to him
since we... stopped talking.

153
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:00,397
(chuckles)

154
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,533
He's pretty good.

155
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:03,784
Pretty good?

156
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:06,153
Last night, you ate
a box of Froot Loops

157
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,255
in your tighty whities.

158
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:10,258
No, I demolished
a box of Froot Loops,

159
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,010
fully nude.

160
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,429
Yeah, "pretty good" works.

161
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,598
Hey, Barney.

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,767
Hey, Lily.

163
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:25,223
Do you know
what this is about?

164
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:25,890
Uh-huh.

165
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:27,108
Do I want to know?

166
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,093
No, sorry, bro.

167
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,311
Damn it!

168
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:31,762
Okay, time
for my stuff.

169
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,981
Guys, I was sitting
at home last night,

170
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,617
and all of a sudden,
I had a piphany.

171
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,985
And my piphany
was this...

172
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,820
Actually, it's, uh,
it's "epiphany."

173
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:42,456
No, Ted, this
is <i>the</i> piphany.

174
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,824
And here it is:

175
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:48,129
Make... every...
night... legendary.

176
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,664
Guys, we've had

177
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,415
some pretty
legendary nights.

178
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,834
But we've also had some nights
that weren't so legendary.

179
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:57,004
Lookin' at you, The Night Ted
Made Us All Watch <i>Norbit.</i>

180
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:59,757
Eddie Murphy as a fat lady;
what's the problem?

181
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,392
That was Eddie Murphy?

182
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:03,394
The non-legendary
nights are done.

183
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:06,480
From here on in, every
single night of our lives

184
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:08,632
will be a night
we'll never forget.

185
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,685
Starting tonight.

186
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:14,638
Who's ready for the longest,
craziest adventure yet?!

187
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,823
(bullet ricocheting)

188
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,491
Good.

189
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:19,977
The weak have been
weeded from our herd.

190
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,862
You ready to rock
and roll, Ted?

191
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,147
Yeah, I'm going home, too.

192
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,715
I'm sensing some costumes
coming up here

193
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:25,866
and I'd rather steer clear.

194
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:28,235
Ted, 20 years from now,

195
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,421
when you're all alone
and I'm President,

196
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,539
you're not
gonna remember

197
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,541
sitting around your
apartment doing nothing.

198
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:35,843
What you will remember
is that tonight,

199
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:38,245
this night...

200
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:41,482
was The Night We Started
a Mariachi Band!

201
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:43,351
<i>Uno, dos, tres, quatro!</i>

202
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,638
(mariachi song ends)

203
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,006
(cheering)

204
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,843
Okay, you were right.

205
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,028
Memorable night.

206
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,180
That was nothing
compared to <i>mañana,</i> amigo.

207
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:58,232
Because <i>mañana</i> is gonna be...

208
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:00,684
The Night We Ate Everything
on the Menu!

209
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:03,304
(groans)

210
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,206
A really memorable night.

211
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,357
But tomorrow night...

212
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:09,477
Is The Night We Brought
a Horse into the Bar!

213
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,963
Okay, but tomorrow...

214
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:16,651
Is The Night We Bungee Jump
off the Statue of Liberty!

215
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:21,305
Nope.

216
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:23,507
NARRATOR: <i>That night was the night</i>
<i>of Aunt Lily</i>

217
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,259
<i>and Uncle Marshall's</i>
<i>fancy dinner.</i>

218
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:28,379
Complete with a fancy limo ride.

219
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,347
Surprise!

220
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:30,514
Hello!

221
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:33,167
Hi, Ranjit.

222
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,855
No.

223
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:47,399
Should I take the
West Side Highway?

224
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,367
Why not, Ranjit?

225
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,503
Don't you always just
take whatever you want,

226
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,405
regardless of
anything but your own

227
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,958
dirty, sick,
twisted appetites?

228
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,497
I'll stay on Broadway.

229
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,999
I.D.?

230
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:07,302
For God's sakes, open your...

231
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:09,421
Yeah, that's about right.

232
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,056
I.D.?

233
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:13,141
NARRATOR: <i>Robin had finally</i>
<i>learned the lesson</i>

234
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:15,226
<i>that nobody</i>
<i>gets famous overnight.</i>

235
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:16,761
<i>But here's the crazy part:</i>

236
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:18,796
<i>that night, she got famous.</i>

237
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:19,964
Robin, there you are.

238
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,299
Sandy Rivers!

239
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:22,434
Star of the show.

240
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,486
What it is, my man.
Yeah.

241
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,154
Robin, I've got
something big for you,

242
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:27,906
something huge.

243
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:29,841
And I want you on it.

244
00:09:29,843 --> 00:09:32,977
Sandy, you were
<i>in</i> the harassment video.

245
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:34,312
You were great in that,
by the way.

246
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,313
Thanks, holmes.

247
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:36,614
And I like the way

248
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,583
your filthy little mind works,
Robin, but this is real.

249
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:39,534
Big story's breaking.

250
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:41,169
Are you afraid of helicopters?

251
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:42,820
I love helicopters.

252
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,340
What am I covering, a war?
Better!

253
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:48,777
ANNOUNCER: <i>World Wide News</i>
<i>brings you the world.</i>

254
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,762
<i>And now Robin Scherbatsky</i>
<i>with traffic.</i>

255
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:55,666
You don't want to go
bungee jumping, fine.

256
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:58,669
Tonight's The Night
We Stole a Mummy

257
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:01,106
from the Natural History Museum!

258
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,342
Yeah, I'm not
doing that.

259
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:08,780
Then get out your MetroCard,
Ted, because tonight's

260
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:11,682
The Night We Partied
with the Mole People!

261
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,020
Barney, I have a Stouffer's
lasagna for one in the freezer

262
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:17,739
that is going to be
unforgettable.

263
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:19,874
I have a <i>Sanford and Son</i>
on my DVR

264
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:22,577
that I will take with me
to my grave.

265
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,296
I don't need tonight to be
any more memorable than that.

266
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:28,216
Okay, <i>Sanford and Son</i>
does sound good.

267
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:32,053
But if I could just present
a counter argument...

268
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:36,891
(imitates Redd Foxx):
You're locked out, dummy!

269
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:38,676
Damn it! Barney!

270
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:40,711
Give me your phone;
I'm calling my super.

271
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:43,214
The only person we're calling
is everyone we know,

272
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:46,518
because tonight's The Night
We Tracked Down Phil Collins,

273
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,220
Became Best Friends with Him,
and Talked Him into Reuniting

274
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,573
with Peter Gabriel,
So Then We Got to Sing Backup

275
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:54,476
On The New Genesis Album
and It Was Awesome!

276
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,562
Fine, I'll use the
phone at the bar.

277
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,784
Ranjit, would you please
put up the partition?

278
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:05,787
Partition going up.

279
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:07,905
You had a sex dream
about Ranjit!

280
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:09,407
Hello.

281
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,842
Ranjit!

282
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,410
Sorry.

283
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:14,412
Okay, yes, I did,

284
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:17,131
but it didn't
mean anything.

285
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,384
Okay, well, what
happened in this dream?

286
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:20,751
And I want to
know everything.

287
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,086
Every explicit detail.

288
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:23,438
Don't leave out any...

289
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,190
Damn it, Ranjit!

290
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,192
Sorry.

291
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,562
Marshall, it was a dream.

292
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,946
Yeah, well, dreams
are just stuff

293
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,232
that you subconsciously
want to happen.

294
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,867
Why do you think
I'm constantly dreaming

295
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,768
about Bigfoot playing
quarterback for the Vikings?

296
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,039
Because you fall asleep
looking at a painting of it.

297
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,540
It soothes me.

298
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,909
Don't try to change the subject.

299
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,828
You sleep-cheated.

300
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,946
You've been
sleep-sleeping around,

301
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,131
and I'm sick of it.

302
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,583
You know,
I have half a mind

303
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,635
to get out and let you
eat all by yourself.

304
00:11:53,637 --> 00:11:55,920
Should I pull over?

305
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,121
Damn it, Ranjit!

306
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,474
Yes, Ranjit.
Pull over.

307
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:02,810
Pulling over.

308
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:03,978
You watch, Ted.

309
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,631
Tonight is going
to be legen--

310
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,716
it's the night
we stole a camel...

311
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:13,855
...which means it'll be
full of drama-- dary.

312
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,823
Dromedary!

313
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:19,410
I applaud your wordplay,
but your core premise is flawed.

314
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:21,579
Every night
can't be legendary.

315
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,116
If all nights are legendary,
no nights are legendary.

316
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:28,403
See, Ted,
that attitude right there,

317
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:30,104
that's why I'm in the lead.

318
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:31,456
What do you mean, in the lead?

319
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,324
I'm talking about
the game of life, Ted.

320
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,459
Scoreboard.

321
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,511
Better wardrobe:
75 points.

322
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:39,047
Apartment on a higher floor:
90 points.

323
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,733
Longer name: 110 points.

324
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:43,801
Sorry. Did you just make up
this point system?

325
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:46,070
Made up the point system:
114 points.

326
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,172
And ten points to you
for pointing that out.

327
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:49,507
Nice job, Ted.

328
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,593
15 points to me
for being gracious enough

329
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:52,961
to give you those ten points.

330
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:54,195
But here's the point, Ted.

331
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,363
Every time I go out

332
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:56,581
and have an awesome night

333
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,715
and you're not there,

334
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:59,350
that's another 100 points
in my column.

335
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,419
So yeah, I'm in the lead.

336
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,205
Barney, the fact that I
can stay home for a night

337
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:06,524
shows that I have inner peace

338
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:08,576
and that I don't feel
the need to keep score.

339
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,244
That's worth like
1,000 points right there,

340
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,914
so at the very
least, we're tied.

341
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,799
We're so not tied.

342
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,234
Although you know
what is tied--

343
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,503
the strap
of my girlfriend's bikini.

344
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,505
Except when it's not,
'cause she's a stripper.

345
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,206
One million points!
Game.

346
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,641
Shh.

347
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:24,726
It's over.

348
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,694
It's done. It's done.

349
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,047
So what do you do?

350
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,382
(laughs)
You're kidding, right?

351
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,184
I... I'm an on-air reporter.

352
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:35,486
I just did a report
like five minutes ago.

353
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,221
You sound frustrated.

354
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,556
Yeah, I am.

355
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:42,560
I'm busting my ass,
and as usual, no recognition.

356
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,663
Robin, I've been
doing this a while,

357
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:48,166
and if there's one thing
I've learned, it's flarm.

358
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,284
What?
Flarm.

359
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,236
Flarm, flarm, flarm.

360
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,788
Blobbum.

361
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,673
(laughing):
What is wrong with you?

362
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,291
Are you having a stroke?

363
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,076
NARRATOR:
<i>As a matter of fact, he was.</i>

364
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,795
Oh! Hold on! Wait!

365
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:02,196
<i>Meanwhile, Lily was in</i>

366
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,382
<i>desperate need</i>
<i>of a female friend.</i>

367
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,351
Lily, I have seen this
a million times.

368
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,886
Guys go crazy when there's
a baby on the way.

369
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:11,255
You should have seen the manager
when his wife got pregnant.

370
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:14,892
After the second trimester,
he made her stop stripping.

371
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:17,228
Yeah, you're right.

372
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,780
Now I feel bad.

373
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:20,264
Our big dinner's been ruined.

374
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,784
Marshall's
probably crying right now.

375
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,536
(crying): I had no idea that
food could be this delicious.

376
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,606
Marshall, you are being crazy.

377
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,608
No, no, I can handle it.

378
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,942
If I sell my laptop,

379
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:34,746
we can get seconds
on those squash blossoms.

380
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,130
I mean about Lily.

381
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:39,500
Well, you know,
she's being crazy, too.

382
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:40,618
She's pregnant.

383
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,053
She gets to be crazy.

384
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,055
You have to be the sane one.

385
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,890
So what, I don't get to be
crazy again

386
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,124
until the baby comes?

387
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:50,261
No. Then it's baby's turn
to be crazy.

388
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:52,963
When do I get to be crazy again?

389
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,465
Never.

390
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,167
(cackling)

391
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,072
We are totally even.

392
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,191
We absolutely are not even,
and here's why.

393
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,742
I'll grant you
that if you include

394
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:07,278
the 12 points
for designing the skyscraper,

395
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,580
the 83 points for slapping five
with Tommy Lee

396
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:12,633
and the 9,000 points
for banging Robin before me,

397
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,303
our point totals
would be about neck and neck,

398
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,205
but there's one thing
you're forgetting.

399
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,456
The fact that I don't care?

400
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,807
No.

401
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:22,310
And you just lost five points
for sass.

402
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:26,297
Do you remember a conversation
we had about three years ago?

403
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,716
Barney, you're
the king.

404
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,268
Nobody picks up chicks like you.

405
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,519
You're handsome,

406
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,354
debonair,

407
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:35,440
everything I wish I could be.

408
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:37,141
I'm starting to think
this never happened.

409
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,160
Let you finish.

410
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,679
You're smooth,
charismatic,

411
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:42,647
"sauve."

412
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,148
I think you mean "suave."

413
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,383
Aha.

414
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,535
So you do remember.

415
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:48,820
But there's one thing

416
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,689
even a master ladies' man
like you could never do,

417
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:53,291
and if you could
ever do it,

418
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,293
it would be worth 500 points.

419
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:59,080
You have my attention,
my slightly shorter friend.

420
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,665
Here's the challenge.

421
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,819
Get a girl's phone number
while you're wearing a dress.

422
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:09,390
Challenge...

423
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:11,092
Accomplished.

424
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:12,176
That's right.

425
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,845
Last year,
I slapped on a dress,

426
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,713
took a few laps
around this very bar,

427
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,215
and I got this:

428
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:19,884
the phone number
of one Stephanie McColgan.

429
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:23,053
Later that night,
I took off my pantyhose,

430
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:25,740
and gave her panties...
my hose.

431
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:27,057
That's right, Ted.

432
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,360
I am 500 points ahead.

433
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,329
Until you can get
a girl's digits

434
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:34,899
while wearing a dress,
you and I will never be even.

435
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,834
You know what? The super's
probably waiting for me,

436
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,619
and I just remembered
there's a spare key

437
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:40,371
under the doormat, so good night.
Wait, wait.

438
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:41,739
Ted, don't go.
Barney, I am leaving.

439
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,875
I'm afraid this is just
one of those nights

440
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,510
we're probably going to forget.

441
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:47,378
I don't think so, dude. Look.

442
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,963
REPORTER: If you're just joining us,

444
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:53,651

by our own Robin Scherbatsky.

445
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,853
This probably won't end well.

454
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,421
I did it!

468

469
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,593
Hey, Marshall.

470
00:18:00,595 --> 00:18:02,495
Hey, Lil.

471
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:04,497
Hey, Barney.

472
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,933
Yes, I know
you're dating a stripper.

473
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,301
Mm-hmm.

476
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:17,360
Okay, I'll keep trying.

477
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:21,197
Babe, I think
I know why you had

478
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,900
that sex dream about Ranjit.
Why?

479
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,201
Think about it.

480
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:27,203
The way he talks
about his kids.

481
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,188
He's a wonderful father.

482
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,826
Just like Papa Smurf,
Bill Cosby...

483
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,662
George Washington,
the father of our country.

484
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,665
You're attracted
to great dads.

485
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,500
And that's why you love me.

486
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:44,037
Because I'm going to be
the greatest dad ever.

487
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,556

I can't go home, Ted.
Why not?
