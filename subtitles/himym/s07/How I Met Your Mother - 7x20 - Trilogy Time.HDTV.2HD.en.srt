Chester,
you're not even dressed.

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:04,990
- The reservation is in 15 minutes.
- Shh!

3
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:05,941
He's back.

4
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:08,410
Every night
at exactly 8:00 p.m.,

5
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:10,829
the well-dressed
blond man appears.

6
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:13,665
WOMAN:
Chuck and Joanne

7
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,450
are going to be waiting.
You don't understand!

8
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:17,002
Every night, he does this.

9
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:19,621
Every single night.

10
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:21,757
He steps out of this building,

11
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:24,743
walks exactly seven paces,
stops,

12
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:27,379
and smiles.

13
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:41,143
Honey, I am worried about you.

14
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:42,811
Is he trying to communicate
with someone?

15
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,479
Is he trying
to communicate with me?

16
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,448
Why is he doing this?!

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,783
But aside from
not being able

18
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:50,535
to fart in the apartment,
how's living with Quinn?

19
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:52,307
Oh, it's great.

Great, great,

So how bad is it?

26
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:12,391
Pretty bad.

27
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:13,225
Last night,

28
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:14,960
I had just come back

29
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:16,127
from my 8:00 fart.

30
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:16,628
Sure.

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,562
Go on.

32
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:19,398
Still no mail.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,483
I think they only deliver it
once a day.

34
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:22,768
Hey, listen,

35
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,070
when I moved in here,
I sold all my stuff

36
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:26,855
because I know you like
your place as is,

37
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:28,407
and I was totally fine
with that.

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,193
Just one little thing:
would it be okay

39
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:33,445
if instead of using
your coffee mugs,

40
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:34,746
we use mine?

41
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:37,532
Hmm...

42
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,418
No.

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,454
Barney, she got rid
of all of her stuff for you.

44
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:44,456
Oh, I see what this
is really about.

45
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,825
Yeah, mugs.

46
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:47,843
Coffee?

47
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:49,378
Tea?

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,546
Eh, religion.

49
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:54,299
This is about the fact
that you don't think

50
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:56,501
this relationship
is gonna last.

51
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:59,021
That's why you don't want
to throw anything out.

52
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:01,390
Because when
that inevitable breakup comes,

53
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,341
you don't want
to buy new mugs.

54
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:05,777
That's why I've never
thrown anything out

55
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:08,146
for any relationship ever.

56
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:10,849
Isn't that right, honey?

57
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:12,818
Oh, that's right. I'm alone.

58
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,987
Lily, here's the thing.

59
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:16,071
It's my apartment,

60
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:19,574
and I need to assert
my dominance as a man.

61
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:22,127
Don't ever say that...

62
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,997
to any girl ever.

63
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,082
Too late.

64
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:28,667
What did you just say to me?

65
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:30,669
- She gave up her apartment for you!
- You said that to her?!

66
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:31,920
Okay, you know what?

67
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:34,806
I don't have to sit here and
take this from you ladies.

68
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:36,374
I'm going to Ted's.

where guys can be guys.

71
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:41,563
- Assert your dominance?
- It's like you have no respect for women.

72
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:43,214
- What is wrong with you?
- You have a mother!

73
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:44,683
You guys, too?

74
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:47,185
(scoffs)
I'm going to the Y for a shvitz.

75
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:48,987
No, dude, hold on.

76
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,405
You're not going anywhere.

77

00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:02,451
Dude, if we fail
this econ final,

82
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,402
for the rest of our lives
we're not gonna be able to...

83
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:06,088
We won't know how to...

84

85
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,674
No idea. We're screwed.

86
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:13,678
But there's only one thing
left to do at at time like this.

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,747
Watch the entire <i>Star Wars</i>
trilogy all the way through

88
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:17,682
because I haven't done that
in, like, five years.

89
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:19,051
Dude, you can't let that happen.

90
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:21,386
If you're not trilling it
at least once every three years,

91
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:23,088
the Dark Side wins.

92
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,473
Okay, let's make a pact.

93
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,424
No matter what,
every three years,

94
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,610
we sit down
and trill it up big time.

95
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:29,728
Agreed?

96
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,230
A-Greedo.

97
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:34,432
Wow.

98
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:36,485
2003, I mean...

99

Hey, Ted.

101

Sweet hair.

102
00:03:46,163 --> 00:03:48,713
I told you it would
eventually stop growing out

103
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,448
and start growing down.

104
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,833

105

yet another skyscraper.

106
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,637
And I'm carrying this briefcase

107
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,124

I'm a successful lawyer...

108
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:00,092
I like that.

109
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,260

And who knows, by then,

113
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:09,151
you and Lily might be engaged.

114
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:12,487
Engaged? Bro, I'm gonna do
way better than that.

115
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,992
Ah, being pregnant
is so much fun.

116
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:19,194

working on your art,

119

since I make enough to
support us both financially?

120
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:26,618
Horny.

121
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,486
I hope we don't
bother you, Ted,

122
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:30,622
because even though
we're married and pregnant,

123
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:31,990
it still makes sense

124
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:35,410
that we all share
adult-sized bunk beds.

00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:50,845
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Lisa.

181
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:54,683
And they never saw her again.

182
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:57,135
Whassaaaa!

183
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:58,687
Okay,

184
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,689
three years ago,
we had this whole fantasy

185
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:02,440
about how great
our lives were gonna be,

186
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:03,692
and it didn't pan out.

187
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,860
But I'm telling you,
three years from now,

188
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:08,029
when we're watching
the trilogy in 2006,

189
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,498
our lives
are gonna be awesome.

190
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,701
(classical music playing)

191
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:18,907
Ah, hello, Ted.

192
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,326
I'm an environmental lawyer now.

193
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,128
Sure, it's not
the most lucrative field,

194
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,430
but luckily I have
the cash and prizes

195
00:07:25,432 --> 00:07:27,632
from my historic seven-week run

196
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:30,218
on <i>Wheel of Fortune...</i>

197
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,354
Can I just make
one little adjustment?

198
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:36,191
...for which I was knighted
by Her Majesty, the Queen.

199
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:38,526
Ah, Lady Aldrin.

200
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:40,445
Oh, Sir Marshall.

201
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,280
I cannot wait to get a house

202
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:44,115
down the street
from your parents

203
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:47,819
so we can be close to your mom,
whom I get along with now.

204
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,154
Good, good.

205
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,572
But here's the best part.

206
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:52,490
Rhiannon, hurry!

207
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:54,459
Just because I designed
the opera house

208
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:57,212
doesn't mean they'll hold
the curtain for us.

209
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:58,630
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

210
00:07:58,632 --> 00:07:59,964
Of course it does.

211
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,083
Take your time, my love.

212
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:05,203
Hey, guys, it's me again.

213
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,888
I'm pretty much
the same as last time,

214
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,841
only now I'm super-rich
and fancy.

215
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:12,710
(speaking French):

216
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:16,848
And it still makes sense
that we all live together.

217
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,817
(laughter)

218
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,268
What about you, Barney?

219
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,103
Any predictions for 2006?

220
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:24,105
Oh, yeah. Picture it.

221
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:26,391
By the way, guys,
this is Jody.

222
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:29,277
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Jody.

223
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:33,231
And they never saw her again.

224
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:35,950
Whassaaaa!

225
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:39,337
How is that any different
from your life right now?

226
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,206
It's not. I'm KFC, baby.

227
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,241
You don't mess
with the Colonel's recipe.

228
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,794
I want things to stay
exactly the same,

229
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,412
but with a different hottie.

230
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:49,798
'Cause Barney don't slurp
no sloppy seconds,

231
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,884
especially his own.

232
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:54,519
Okay, the bottom line is

233
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,137
things are gonna get better.

234
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,473
Well, all I care about is
getting into law school.

235
00:08:58,475 --> 00:08:59,924
You will.

236
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,677
2006 is gonna be awesome.

237
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,650
And look what happened.

238
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:10,318
You got into law school,

239
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,953
just like I said you would.

240
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:14,205
See, things aren't so bad.

241
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,606
Lily left me.

242
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:20,378
And now I'll never have
a mustache.

243
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,390
Baby, there you are.

244
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:29,060
I have spent all day thinking
about all the naughty,

245
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:31,429
naughty things
you and I are gonna do

246
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:32,463
to cheer up Marshall.

247
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:34,432
Like what?

248
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:35,766
Um...

249
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:38,135
Uh, I'll you guys
hang out, okay?

250
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,737
Um, I'll just be...

251
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:40,738
waiting in the bedroom.

252
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,822
(giggles, groans)

253
00:09:41,824 --> 00:09:43,357
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean that

254
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,394
to sound like Ted and I are
gonna do a kind of thing.

255
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:51,482
Okay, okay.

256
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:52,833
See you.

257
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,085
Marshall, this will pass.

258
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:55,252
Trust me.

259
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:57,338
Three years from now...

260
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:00,658
Briefcase, lawyer,

261
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,009
knighthood, mustache,

262
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,878
all that stuff from before.

263
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,513
Congratulations, bro.

264
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,348
And congratulations
to you too, Ted,

265
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,133
for locking this down.

266
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:11,552
You know, it's weird,

267
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:13,187
I never thought I
would get married,

268
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,438
but you talked me into it.

269
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,607
Or rather, banged
me into it.

270
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,392
You're so good in bed, ooh.

271
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:20,511
(kissing noisily)

272
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,113
How is this helping me?

273
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm getting to it.

274
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:27,368
In three years, not only
will Lily be back, but...

275
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,188
(sighs) It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

276
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,125
and be carrying his child.

277
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:36,377
I think you're being
kind of optimistic, Ted.

278
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,963
Can I make
one little adjustment?

279
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:42,983
(sighs) It's so nice to be married
to a wonderful guy

280
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,635
and carrying his child,

281
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:46,754
and here he is now.

282
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:48,889
Guys, I want you to meet

283
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:50,841
some douchey guy named Trey.

284
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,094
- 'Sup, bro?
- Mmm.

285
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:54,878
I don't know
what I love more:

286
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,647
his thick mustache

287
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:57,732
or his trucker hat.

288
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,767
You know I hate those hats.

289
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,436
Then you're really gonna
hate this sonogram.

290
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,026
Nooo...

291
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:12,229
ooo...!

292
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:16,951
(chuckles) A baby in a trucker hat.
That's awesome.

293
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:18,018
Anyway,
Ted's right.

294
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,504
2009's gonna rule.

295
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:22,506
By the way, guys,
this is Maya.

296
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:26,427
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

297
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,595
(laughs)

298
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:29,430
And they never saw her again.

299
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:30,914
Whassaaaa!

300
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,082
Okay, seriously,

301
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,350
at least tell me
you're gonna

302
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,085
change the what
will by then be

303
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,420
nine-year-old beer
commercial reference.

304
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:37,354
I mean,
come on.

305
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:38,606
There's got to be
at least one way

306
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,191
that you'd like the future
to be different.

307
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:42,777
I guess there is one thing.

308
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,595
By the way, guys, this is Maya.

309
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,731
You'll be seeing
a lot more of Maya.

310
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,866
And not because
of these these.

311
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:52,019
Because of <i>these.</i>

312
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:54,989
Back boobs--
the visual stimulation

313
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:57,074
of missionary meets
the emotional detachment

314
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,409
of doggy-style.

315
00:11:58,411 --> 00:11:59,710
Patent pending.

316
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,078
Whassaaaa!

317
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,113
The point is, Marshall,

318
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:07,017
this time in three years,
everything is gonna be great.

319
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,307
See? Lily came back.

320
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:16,427
Of course, Robin and I
didn't end up together.

321
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,512
But I did get engaged.

322
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:20,314
And left at the altar.

323
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,349
But I did start
my own architectural firm.

324
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,101
And it failed
after a few months.

325
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,103
- Can we put the movie on, please?
- Yeah.

326
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:26,937
Sure, buddy.

327
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,472
Hey, by the way,
where is Robin?

328
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,324
<i>In the summer of 2009,</i>

329
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:32,426
<i>Barney and Robin</i>
<i>were secretly dating.</i>

330
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:34,945
Oh, uh, Barney said she's
taking some extension class

331
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:36,664
in how to decoupage,
and Barney's taking

332
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,649
a different decoupage class
in the same building.

333
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,918
That's why they shared
that cab that one time.

334
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,255
<i>We were idiots.</i>

335
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:46,156
Wait a minute.

336
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:50,744
You're saying that Barney Stinson
is at a decoupage class?

337
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:53,964
That means we can watch
<i>Star Wars</i> on his giant TV!

338
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,800
Punch it, Chewy!

339
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:02,223
(panting, moaning)
Oh.

340
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,340
You're back
from decoupage.

341
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:04,692
What's decoupage?

342
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:07,394
Oh, uh, yeah, I took that
cab there that one time.

343
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:08,896
Hold on.

344
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:13,016
Come on in.

345
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:16,520
We were hoping we could
watch the trilogy here.

346
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,456
Uh, sure. But, uh...

347
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,692
first go look out
my, uh, bedroom window.

348
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,661
There's a, uh...

349
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:26,463
naked lady, uh...

350
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:29,032
jumping up and down
on a mini-trampoline

351
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:31,752
in the apartment
across the, uh...

352
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,220
street.

353
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,672
(gasps, laughs)

354
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,644
(whispering):
Get me out of this thing!

355
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:41,929
There's no time!

356
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,265
Barney, I am not ready for them
to find out about us.

357
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,383
Then you're gonna have to stay
in there for the entire trilogy.

358
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,652
Don't worry. It's
only 382 minutes.

359
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:49,987
Nerd!

360
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:55,109
So, where do you guys think
we'll be in three years?

361
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:56,894
It'll be 2012.

362
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,779
(chuckles)
That's an easy one.

363
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:00,014
Guys, this is Sophia.

364
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:02,066
(glass shatters)
You'll be seeing a lot more of...

365
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,819
MARSHALL:
Okay, that is so weird.

366
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:09,139
I was just trying
to use the force.

367
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,592
Do you think instead
of making a beer

368
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:14,595
fly out of the fridge,
I made that lamp break?

369
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,764
Either that
or the stormtrooper did.

370
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:17,848
(laughter)

371
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,634
Oh, the stormtrooper
would never do that.

372
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:24,154
He knows that lamp costs $1,200.

373
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:26,590
Anyway, while it's just us guys,

374
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:29,777
let me ask you something:
we've all had that same fantasy

375
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,864
about having sex with a girl in
a stormtrooper costume, right?

376
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,533
- Mmm, no.
- Never.

377
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:37,985
Guys...

378
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,537
come on, no girls around,
just us bros.

379
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:41,789
Safe space.

380
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,441
Let's stop being polite
and start gettin' real.

381
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,460
Stormtrooper fantasy.

382
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:48,245
Every guy's had that one, right?

383
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,881
Not even once, no.
No, no, no.

384
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:53,634
So I'm the weird one?

385
00:14:53,636 --> 00:14:55,285
Yeah.
Yeah.

386
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:56,587
Yeah.

387
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:57,671
How about you, Ted?

388
00:14:57,673 --> 00:15:00,624
How's your life gonna
be different

389
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,643
Oh, you know,
the usual.

390
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,895
Gonna meet a nice girl
and get married.

391
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:07,431
I mean, I know I say that
every year, but...

392
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,267
let's be honest,
in 2012, I'll be 34.

393
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:12,102
If it still hasn't
happened for me by then,

394
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:16,190
(laughing): something is seriously
wrong with me!

395
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,995
(laughter continues)

396
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:29,770
Something is seriously wrong
with me.

397
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,302
I can't do
this anymore.

398
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,653
I can't
keep smiling

399
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,388
and being optimistic
all the time

400
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,557
when all the evidence
points to the contrary.

401
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,776
You really think
that three years from now

402
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:42,227
things aren't gonna be awesome?

403
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,530
I'll tell you what
things are gonna be like

404
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,548
three years from now.

405
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:50,636
Uh, yes, hello. I see

406
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:55,190
on my frozen entree for one
they printed this number

407
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:57,893
where I can voice
comments and concerns.

408
00:15:57,895 --> 00:16:00,562
Well, there's more cinnamon

409
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:03,432
in the cobbler than usual.

410
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:05,801
No, I like cinnamon.

411
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:11,240
Oh, you're very welcome
for my comment.

412
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:14,810
Wait! Uh, don't go.

413
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:17,479
Um... do you like cinnamon?

414
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,531
Hello? Hello?

415
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:28,407
Marshall, you want
to watch <i>Star Wars?</i>

416
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:29,992
No, can do, old bean!

417
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:31,476
You see, we're up on the Cape

418
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:32,861
living the idyllic
family lifestyle

419
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,312
that you've always
dreamed of.

420
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:38,901
Oh, and I'm pregnant
with baby #5!

421
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:40,869
But baby #4 isn't even out yet.

422
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,621
I'm just that good!
(chuckles)

423
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:43,755
Oh, oh, hold on.

424
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:45,490
There's somebody wants
to say hello to you.

425
00:16:45,492 --> 00:16:46,992
(chuckles softly)

426
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:48,210
Hey, Ted.

427
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:50,429
I just wanted to say
that things are great,

428
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,448
and I'm married to that
douchey guy in the trucker hat.

429
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,883
Whassup, bra?

430
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,003
It turns out it was just <i>you</i>

431
00:16:58,005 --> 00:16:59,738
I didn't want to commit to.

432
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,672
(laughter)

433
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:01,673
Oh,

434
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,176
and I got back boobs.
(giggles)

435
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:06,194
So things are great!

436
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:07,496
Buh-bye!

437
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:08,697
(squeals)

438
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,616
(laughter)

439
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,317
(laughter)

440
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,319
By the way, Ted,
this is Melanie.

441
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,321
You'll be seeing a
lot more of Melanie.

442
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:17,623
BARNEY:
<i>Wait-wait-wait a minute!</i>

443
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,957
Who is Melanie?

444
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,043
Come on, Barney, if there's
one thing I can count on

445
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:22,327
not to change,
it's you walking in

446
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,912
with some random
girl on your arm.

447
00:17:23,914 --> 00:17:26,331
No. No, I don't want that.

448
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,633
For the first time

449
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:29,751
in my life, I don't
want to find myself

450
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:31,720
in three years
with some random girl,

451
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:33,705
no matter
how many boobs she has.

452
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:36,441
I want to be with Quinn.

453
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:41,212
Guys...

454
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:43,432
you're gonna be seeing
a lot more of Quinn.

455
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:45,901
Dude, we've been to the
Lusty Leopard. We've seen plenty.

456
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:48,687
I kind of walked into that one.
All right, bye-bye.

457
00:17:54,226 --> 00:17:55,610
What are you doing?

458
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:57,329
We're living together,
I'm excited about it,

459
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,298
and I'm getting
rid of my mugs.

460
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:01,867
That was mine.

461
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:04,286
Sorry. I don't know
which are which.

462
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:07,589
Truth is, I never
drink coffee at home.

463
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,041
This one?
Mm-hmm.

464
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:10,759
There!

465
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:12,961
I don't need my coffee mugs
'cause I got yours!

466
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:14,763
For the rest of my life.

467
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,516
Or as... long as
you'll have me.

468
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,768
We haven't really talked
about the future.

469
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,920
Did I make things awkward?

470
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,355
Just keep smashing mugs.

471
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,439
(chuckles)

472
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:26,808
Or donate them.

473
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,643
Point is,

474
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,563
I plan on being with you
for a long time.

475
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,482
You okay with that?

476
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:39,938
Sounds great.

477
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:44,359
(farts)
Ooh.. Oh!

478
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:49,247
I am so sorry.

479
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:50,499
No, no, it's great.

480
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:53,635
A guy has to be the first one
to let 'er rip.

481
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,721
I was actually hoping
this would happen soon.

482
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:58,289
I've been crop-dusting
the patio for weeks.

483
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,125
- The <i>patio!</i>
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:02,127
I've been going
out on the street,

485
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,230
like, exactly this time
every night.

486
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,733
Where are you, blond man?!

487
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:10,102
Show yourself!

488
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:13,071
I will be at my mother's.

489
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:15,306
We're a real couple now,
aren't we?

490
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:17,359
We are.

491
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:18,944
(chuckles softly)

492
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:21,146
(both fart)

493
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:24,316
(chuckles)

494
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:27,202
Hey, buddy, I get
that you're bummed.

495
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:30,321
But I got a good feeling
about 2015.

496
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,624
I think that's
gonna be your year.

497
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:35,594
<i>Kids, that was the one time</i>
<i>I ever lost faith</i>

498
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:38,830
<i>in the idea that my life</i>
<i>would be better in three years.</i>

499
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:41,767
<i>And what's funny is,</i>
<i>three years from that moment,</i>

500
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,802
<i>my life was amazing.</i>

501
00:19:43,804 --> 00:19:45,387
All right!
It's trilogy time!

502
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,172
Can I just lodge
one complaint?

503
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:48,607
This is a guy's tradition.

504
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,193
It's kind of a lame move
on Ted's part to bring a chick.

505
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,779
Come on, dude...
cut him some slack.

506
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:55,030
I know. He loves her.

507
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,699
And I'll give him this:
she is pretty damn cute.

508
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:00,118
Thank God she takes
after her mother.

509
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,572
All right,
let's watch this thing!

510
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,240
TV...

511
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:09,527
play <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy.

512
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,999
Play <i>Star Wars</i> tril...

513
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,917
You know what?
Screw it.

514
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:21,239
Okay, you are about to see
something awesome.

515
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,041
And just know this:

516
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:25,293
Han shot first.

517
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:28,814
I wonder if things'll
be a lot different

518
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,267
when we watch the trilogy
again in 2018.

519
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,619
I hope not.

520
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,584
(panting)

521
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,953
Oh, that was awesome.

522
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,390
You were right--
not weird.

523
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:47,924
No.
