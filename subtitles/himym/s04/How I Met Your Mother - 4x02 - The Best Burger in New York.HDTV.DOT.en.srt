3
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,120
Kids When I first moved to new york,

4
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,320
It was dingy, disgusting,

5
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,320
Dirty, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,960
And altogether terrifying, but then,

7
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,150
The most awful thing happened--

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,230
The whole city started to go uphill.

9
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,750
The streets got a little cleaner,

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,160
The rents got a little higher, and one by one,

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,710
The crappy old places we loved began to disappear.

12
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,200
The elbow room, an old punk rock club,

13
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,900
Became a drugstore;

14
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,880
Mchale's, a working-class watering hole,

15
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,860
Became a fast-food place;

16
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,880
And fez, a moroccan-themed lounge,

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,430
Became a bank.

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,960
And not just any bank.

19
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,240
Goliath national bank.

20
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,380
The world leader in credit and banking.

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,460
God, I love Goliath National Bank!

22
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,860
Okay, first of all,

23
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,900
You look like the last pick in the draft.

24
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,970
And, uh, second,

25
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,240
Why are you so excited about some bank?

26
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,180
Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Ah.

27
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,290
Took two months.

28
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,060
Cost 2,000 jobs. Oh!

29
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,580
It was brutal.

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,170
Who wants a t-shirt?

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Hey, Marshall,

32
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,540
They're hiring in the legal department.

33
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,810
I could get you a job.

34
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,410
Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job

35
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,840
Just to go work at a bank.

36
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,360
He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.

37
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,070
That was the plan, anyway.

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,460
Over the next few weeks,

39
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,910
Marshall went on a lot of interviews.

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,440
You are confident,

41
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,050
You are energetic,

42
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,780
You are focused!

43
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,530
A lot of interviews.

44
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,640
You are flexible on salary,

45
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,780
You're willing to compromise,

46
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,300
You're not gonna cry this time.

47
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,120
Too many interviews.

48
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,780
You are sad,

49
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,850
You are beaten down,

50
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,700
You will get through this, come home,

51
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,210
Get in your big underpants and take a nap.

52
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,710
Which brings us to september 29,

53
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
The night of the burger.

54
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,990
So, um, what do you guys want to do for dinner?

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,660
Oh, we just got a new cook.

56
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,310
You have to try the burger-- it's amazing.

57
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,980
Oh, great-- we'll take five of those.

58
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,920
Five burgers.

59
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,290
Whoa, um, really?

60
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,440
You-you want to eat here?

61
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,520
Yeah, I'm freaking starving.

62
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,480
I just finished a seven-day cleanse.

63
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,470
I thought you just started that yesterday.

64
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120
I finished early, okay?

65
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,160
Five of those.

66
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,500
Five burgers. Whoa, um, wait.

67
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,550
What about sushi? Oh, we had sushi last night.

68
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,390
Italian. I had italian for lunch.

69
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,440
I can come back. No. We always do this.

70
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,340
We spend an hour arguing about where to eat,

71
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,660
And then we end up eating here anyway.

72
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,630
I haven't eaten for two days.

73
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,630
Can we please, for the love of god,

74
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,850
Just order something now?

75
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,330
Chinese?

76
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,760
I don't like chinese.

77
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,540
Indian?

78
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,290
I just said I don't like chinese.

79
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,940
Indian isn't chinese.

80
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,130
Weird meats, funny music, side of rice.

81
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,590
Why are we splitting hairs?

82
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,350
Mexican?

83
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,120
I just said I don't like chinese.

84
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,320
Robin, yours will be right out.

85
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,460
Of course, mine comes last.

86
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,740
Go ahead, start without me.

87
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,930
Sweet! Oh. You shouldn't have.

88
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,140
That's so kind of you. Thank you.

89
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,470
Mmm! Oh, my god.

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
This burger is so good.

91
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,570
It's like christmas in my mouth--

92
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,220
Meat christmas.

93
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,930
It's like an angel from heaven

94
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,280
Landed in the kitchen at Maclaren's.

95
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,880
Where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder.

96
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,270
I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.

97
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,120
It's okay.

98
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,590
Are you kidding me?!

99
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,960
Guys, guys, guys.

100
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,830
When you've had the best burger in new york city,

101
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,000
Every other burger

102
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,830
Tastes like my grandpa's feet.

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,070
But you guys

104
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,220
Eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet.

105
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,930
Oh, and you've had the best burger in new york.

106
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,520
It was eight years ago, my first week in new york,

107
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,420
And for a kid from minnesota,

108
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,750
The big city was a scary place.

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,510
Oh, thank god it's just you.

110
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
You are being ridiculous.

111
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,200
Tell me you left the apartment today.

112
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,200
Why would I have to leave?

113
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,510
I can have anything I want delivered,

114
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,200
And new york city cable is awesome.

115
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,470
Have you seen this public access show

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,330
With the old jewish lady in a bikini?

117
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,630
It's, it's disgusting.

118
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,820
Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia.

119
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,360
You are not gonna get mugged.

120
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,120
Well, what if I do, Ted, all right?

121
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,350
I don't have a switchblade.

122
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,410
I don't, I don't know how to, how to break-dance

123
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,780
And win the begrudging respect of a street gang.

124
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,750
All right, that's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.

125
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,860
No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on.

126
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,430
I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable. Go!

127
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,560
Go outside, go, go.

128
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,780
Okay.

129
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,880
Leave the bat.

130
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,160
Fine.

131
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,840
So I went for a walk in the big, scary city.

132
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,850
And I discovered

133
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,270
It wasn't scary at all.

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,560
What's the word?

135
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,420
Your search is over!

136
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,610
And then, right when I started to get a little hungry,

137
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,130
I turned a corner...

138
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,990
...And there it was.

139
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,780
The tiniest little burger joint you ever saw,

140
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,890
Tucked between a taxidermist and a triple-x bookstore.

141
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,860
Name two places where things get stuffed.

142
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,650
So, I went inside.

143
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,760
And I ordered the burger.

144
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,630
Thank you.

145
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,310
Ted.

146
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,640
Ted, you got to wake up. Ted, wake...

147
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,270
Oh, my god.

148
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

149
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,430
I'm all right.

150
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:14,970
Ted.

151
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,790
Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life!

152
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,740
It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there,

153
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,250
So it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot.

154
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,700
But the burger, Ted. The burger.

155
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,920
Dude. I want one of those burgers right now!

156
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,130
Do you think they're still open? I don't know.

157
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,900
Does stuff in new york stay open past... 9:30?

158
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,410
So we went out to get another burger.

159
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,290
But after hours of searching...

160
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,160
Damn it!

161
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,650
Where is this place?

162
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,820
You couldn't find it?

163
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,030
We didn't know our way around.

164
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,810
Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours

165
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,740
And one very helpful drag queen.

166
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,760
Wait, Betty Noir was a drag queen?

167
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Well, where do you think it was?

168
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,470
Probably tucked between her legs.

169
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,550
You know what's not a drag?

170
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,940
Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank.

171
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,090
I'm just saying.

172
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,930
Anyways, um, we never found the place.

173
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,780
Now, eight years have passed,

174
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,410
Still... No burger.

175
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,420
I couldn't help but overhear.

176
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,410
Okay, here we go.

177
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,650
I know the place you're talking about.

178
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,830
No, you don't.

179
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
It's a place called the corner bistro.

180
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,660
Great burger.

181
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,810
Oh, the corner bistro!

182
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,450
It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life

183
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,950
Searching for the best burger in new york city,

184
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,710
But silly me,

185
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,310
It never occurred to me to check

186
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,300
The highest-rated burger in the zagat guide.

187
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,480
Wow, thanks a lot, guy.

188
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,270
Let me return the favor.

189
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,810
Coffee? Starbucks. Shh!

190
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,530
So I take it you've tried the corner bistro.

191
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,980
Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger

192
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,240
In new york city trying to find that burger.

193
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,070
We're going.

194
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,590
But none of those places even came close.

195
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,830
Hey, there was that one time

196
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,060
We thought we had a break in the case, remember? Ah.

197
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,850
Get this.

198
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,210
You know who works out at my gym?

199
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,640
Regis Philbin.

200
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,670
The autographed picture.

201
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,000
Of course I remember the place.

202
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,280
It was the best burger I ever had.

203
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,740
I still have dreams about this burger.

204
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,260
Beautiful, haunting dreams!

205
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,110
I wake up at night screaming,

206
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,960
"get out of my head, burger!

207
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,310
Get out!"

208
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,340
That's the one, mr. Philbin.

209
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,690
Do you remember where it is? No!

210
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,030
I never wrote it down.

211
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,540
But not a day goes by

212
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,320
That I don't Regret it.

213
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,090
Why? Why?

214
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,330
Do you know where it is?

215
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,600
No. Huh? And if you tell me

216
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,480
It's at the corner bistro,

217
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,150
I'm gonna smack you right in the face!

218
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,480
No, we don't, we don't know where it is.

219
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,360
Listen, blondie! Oh!

220
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,940
Don't mess with me!

221
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,900
Daddy needs his meat.

222
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,740
I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!

223
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,150
What about you, lurch?

224
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,470
And what about you, satchel-mouth?

225
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,490
This is my cell.

226
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,420
You find that burger, you call me day or night.

227
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,830
Okay, Regis, we will, we will. All right,

228
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,280
So what are you waiting for? Get out and find the burger!

229
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,390
All right, all right. Let's go, all of you!

230
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,780
That's where my story ends.

231
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,940
Now I'm doomed to walk the earth

232
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,980
Forever searching for that green door

233
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,750
And that red neon sign that says "burger."

234
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,790
Green door, red neon sign that says "burger?"

235
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,210
Yeah. I know that place. I've walked by it

236
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,960
A million times.

237
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,040
It's on west 12th,

238
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,510
Right off of 7th.

239
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,510
I knew it was on a numbered street!

240
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,100
Finally.

241
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,800
No! Robin!

242
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,820
If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight,

243
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,060
It's gonna be the best burger in new york.

244
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,990
We're going downtown!

245
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,980
I cannot believe we finally gonna have this burger.

246
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,550
Honey, I'm so excited for you.

247
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,180
After all these interviews,

248
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,860
After all these disappointments,

249
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,600
You deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.

250
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,660
You know what else is a mouthful?

251
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,890
All that double-talk other banks give you.

252
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,780
At Goliath,

253
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,860
Customer satisfaction

254
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,380
Is our most important investment.

255
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,430
Barney, I hate to break this to you,

256
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,550
But working for a bank's kind of lame.

257
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh, yeah.

258
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,270
How lame is free automatic bill pay, Lil?

259
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,160
How lame is 3.3% apy online savings? Yeah!

260
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,280
That's right.

261
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,320
Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends,

262
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,870
But you left me no choice.

263
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,330
We should probably call Regis.

264
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,120
Reg...

265
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,400
Oh, that guy scares me.

266
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,990
I think I'll leave him a text.

267
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,540
Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads.

268
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,990
The one before that was tails.

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,460
You polled the audience,

270
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,400
They came out split, 50/50.

271
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,040
No help at all there.

272
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,930
So, for $258,000...

273
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,200
I have to ask you, Kathy, 

274
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,880
What's that gonna be?

275
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,360
Heads...

276
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,070
...Or...

277
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,300
Excuse me.

278
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,970
Oh, boy. I-i've got to go.

279
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,430
I've got to go!

280
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,300
Green door, red neon sign.

281
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,800
Guys, this is the place.

282
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,700
Oh, n-no, I've actually, I've actually,

283
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,780
Um, I prepared a few words.

284
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,640
I will eat your Hand. All right, well, let's just go inside then.

285
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Shall we?

286
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,680
Thank you. You're welcome.

287
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,080
Yours will be right out.

288
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,510
Please, go ahead, start.

289
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,880
Oh, no... Oh... Just shut up and eat.

290
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,860
All right.

291
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,480
Oh, my god.

292
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,630
I'm never brushing my teeth again

293
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,190
Unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.

294
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,000
I think I just had my first burg-asm.

295
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,440
I want...

296
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,450
To take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie,

297
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,100
Then take it back to my place,

298
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,040
Put on a little Terence Trent D'arby,

299
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,860
And then I would just... Fool around a little bit.

300
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,380
Nothing serious-- just take it slow, you know?

301
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
This isn't it.

302
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,030
What?! Marshall.

303
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,170
It's not it.

304
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,130
Okay, Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but...

305
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,200
Is it at all possible this is the same burger

306
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,360
You had eight years ago,

307
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,620
Only it could never live up

308
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,690
To your ridiculously high expectations?

309
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,530
I mean, it is just a burger.

310
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,760
Just a burger?

311
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,080
Just a burger?

312
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,870
Robin,

313
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,740
It's so much more than just a burger.

314
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,110
I, I mean, that first bite--

315
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,500
Oh, what heaven that first bite is.

316
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,680
The bun, like a sesame- freckled breast of an angel,

317
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,500
Resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below.

318
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,120
Flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux.

319
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,780
And then...

320
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,850
...A pickle--

321
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,580
The most playful little pickle,

322
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,370
And then a slice of tomato,

323
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,460
A leaf of lettuce, and a,

324
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,680
A patty of ground beef

325
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,680
So exquisite...

326
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,040
Swirling in your mouth,

327
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,390
Breaking apart and combining again in a fugue

328
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,100
Of sweets and savories so...

329
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,890
Delightful.

330
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,420
This is no mere sandwich

331
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,160
Of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin.

332
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,260
This is god speaking to us through food.

333
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,840
And you got our wedding vows off the internet.

334
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,880
Okay, uh, look, so, so this, this isn't the place.

335
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,900
All right, it's no big deal.

336
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,060
It's another place with a green door

337
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,240
And a red neon sign that says "burger."

338
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,380
I'll just, uh, I'll call every restaurant in manhattan

339
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,780
And ask 'em what color their door is.

340
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,090
No big deal, right?

341
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,260
Let's do this.

342
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm going to go out on a limb here

343
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,710
And say this isn't just about a burger.

344
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,590
Marshall's not doing so well, guys.

345
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,890
He really needs to get a job.

346
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,430
Tell them about the underpants.

347
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,120
What about the underpants?

348
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,780
It started a couple of weeks ago.

349
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,230
Heads!

350
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,830
It's going to be heads.

351
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,670
It's almost usually heads.

352
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,540
Hey, baby.

353
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,610
Did you put on pants today?

354
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,810
Nope.

355
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,530
It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing.

356
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,290
I thought, "okay, well,

357
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,010
At least he's not leaving the house like that."

358
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,440
Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper.

359
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,560
Day after that,

360
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,710
Went downstairs to get the mail.

361
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,810
Everyone's got an underpants radius.

362
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,000
For most of us,

363
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,390
It's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom,

364
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,310
But as your self- esteem gets smaller,

365
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,310
Your underpants radius gets bigger.

366
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,730
How big is Marshall's underpants radius?

367
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,240
We're going.

368
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,080
Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.

369
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,170
You know, Lil, when times are tough,

370
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,280
I like to remember the uplifting words

371
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,830
Of my favorite song.

372
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,660
* we'll be on your side when you need a friend *

373
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,660
* through thick and thin *

374
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,880
* you can always depend *

375
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,450
* on the world leaders *

376
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,280
* in credit and banking... *

377
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,470
* Goliath National Bank. *

378
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,930
Member fdic.

379
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,890
We've got to find Marshall that burger.

380
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,730
Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.

381
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,140
I'm not eating that burger.

382
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,320
No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger,

383
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,400
This isn't the burger.

384
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,140
Finally. Excuse me.

385
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,370
Yes. Did you guys

386
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,400
Change cooks or something? Because my husband

387
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,590
Was here five years ago,

388
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,930
And he's pretty sure he had a different burger.

389
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,920
Yeah, we get this a lot.

390
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,550
This place is modeled after this other place uptown

391
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,440
With the same green door and "burger" sign.

392
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,330
What? Uptown? Where?

393
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,850
106th and manhattan avenue.

394
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,790
Damn it.

395
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,230
106.

396
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,340
A numbered street.

397
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,670
Of course.

398
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,210
Barney Stinson.

399
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,670
Barney, where the hell are you?

400
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,730
I'm sorry, this is...?

401
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,520
Regis. I'm at the place.

402
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,400
Oh, Regis, of course.

403
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

404
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,990
I forgot to call you.

405
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's not the place.

406
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,940
The real place is on 106th and manhattan avenue.

407
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,000
We're headed there right now.

408
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,840
What?! Uptown?!

409
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,270
Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20.

410
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,030
If you get there first, medium rare. Onions?

411
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,290
Onions?! Okay, no onions.

412
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,740
Stop the cab!

413
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,310
Wait.

414
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,680
This is it.

415
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,880
Your search is over.

416
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,380
We got girls taking off their clothes.

417
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,610
This is it.

418
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,410
One of 9,000 convenient locations.

419
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,780
It was ri-- it was right here.

420
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,810
It was, it was right on this very spot.

421
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,240
I don't understand. Where is the burger place?

422
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,720
It's not a burger place anymore; it's a...

423
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,010
Goliath national bank atm. W-well, that's fine.

424
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,340
Let's just eat here.

425
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,600
We can't eat here.

426
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,960
It's an atm.

427
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,030
But food.

428
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,180
Ow, ow, hey, what the--?

429
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,910
This is your fault, you and your stupid bank.

430
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,990
You did this. It's not my-- stop, okay.

431
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,960
Stop that, Lily.

432
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,040
I will never use a Goliath atm ever again.

433
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,600
Goliath national bank sucks.

434
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,470
It's the worst bank on the face of the earth.

435
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,840
Attention, new yorkers, this bank sucks!

436
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,730
They suck!

437
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,000
Aw, geez. They suck,

438
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,700
Suck, suck! Marshall, will you just tell her already?

439
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,630
Tell me what?

440
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,490
Tell me what?

441
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,110
I got a job.

442
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,810
What? Where?

443
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,420
Goliath national bank.

444
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,930
That's why Barney's

445
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,200
Been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is.

446
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,890
He wanted you to be excited for me

447
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,010
Since we're going to be working there together.

448
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,170
Well, technically not together.

449
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,090
You won't have access to my floor.

450
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,230
But you want to be an environmental lawyer.

451
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,790
Yeah, you know, and I also want

452
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,300
To be a harlem globetrotter and get paid in candy, but...

453
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,580
In the meantime,

454
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,860
I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one.

455
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,050
It's great pay and there's good benefits,

456
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,880
And to be honest,

457
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,050
It gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning.

458
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,690
You know, I have my whole life

459
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,830
To save the planet, but right now

460
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,590
I'm, I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.

461
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,510
You've got great pants.

462
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,620
I love you.

463
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,800
I love you.

464
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,190
Robin, no.

465
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,490
They're unopened. Give it.

466
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,190
They're barbecue. Give it!

467
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,250
I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.

468
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,340
It's stupid.

469
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,260
I think about that first week in new york.

470
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,070
You know?

471
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,810
I was 22 years old.

472
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,160
I had my whole future ahead of me.

473
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,240
I guess I just kind of thought that

474
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,900
If I could have that burger one more time

475
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,690
And feel that way for one more night,

476
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,100
That I might be able to check that off the list,

477
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,420
And grow up,

478
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,150
Go work for the stupid bank, and just be happy.

479
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,670
You know, that burger place isn't gone.

480
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,590
It just moved to a new location.

481
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,460
And I can tell you

482
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,100
Where that is for a hundred bucks.

483
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,010
A hundred bucks?

484
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,350
That's crazy.

485
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,240
Let's pay the man.

486
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,480
I paid for the cab.

487
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,280
I don't have any cash. I haven't worked since march.

488
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Wow, if only there were an easy,

489
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,610
Convenient way to get some cash right now.

490
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,350
Member fdic.

491
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,950
So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later...

492
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,180
Thank you.

493
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,780
All right, Marshall, remember.

494
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,120
It might not taste as good.

495
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,090
This place has changed, you've changed, new york has changed.

496
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,090
Just... Don't get your hopes up too high, okay?

497
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,350
This is it.

498
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,310
Yes!

499
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,630
It's exactly the same.

500
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,710
It's the best burger in new york.

501
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,830
Go ahead, eat up, eat up.

502
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,310
And so, after finally tasting again

503
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,590
The burger he'd craved for so many years,

504
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,000
Marshall got up the next morning, put on some pants,

505
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,580
I want to get tiny fitted sheets

506
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,950
For this burger, and just crawl into this bun,

507
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,380
Get all cozy, and die there.

508
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,440
Oh, myod.

509
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,040
I just want you inside of me.

510
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,750
This feels so good.

511
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,180
I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.

512
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,270
If he does get that burger pregnant,

513
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,470
I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.

514
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,340
This isn't it.

515
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,590
What?! No, Regis Philbin.

516
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,180
Come on.

517
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,340
That's outrageous.

518
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,250
That is unbelievable.

519
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,160
Wait.

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
519
