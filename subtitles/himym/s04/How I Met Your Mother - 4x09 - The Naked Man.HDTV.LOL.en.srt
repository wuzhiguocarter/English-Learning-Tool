1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,790
Kids,everyone has anpinion

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,760
on how long it takes to recover from a breakup.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,980
Half the length of the relationship.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,020
One week for every month you were together.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,320
Exactly 10,000 drinks. However long that takes.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
You can't measure something

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,810
like this in time.

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,420
There's a series of steps.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,650
From her bed to the front door.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,210
Bam! Out of there. Next!

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,040
But I think you start to recover

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,700
the moment you meet that person who gets you back in the game.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,930
This is the story of how I met that person.

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,830
Now,kids,if you want to go swimming,

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,780
you don't just dive in.

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,750
First,you dip your toe in the water.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,240
Hey.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,110
Hi.

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,950
You check the temperature. See how it feels.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:59,770
I'm Ted.

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,250
Vicky.

22
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,640
And then you slowly wade in.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,740
I got left at the altar a month ago.

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,230
Or,you know,cannonball.

25
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,550
It was a complete disaster and ever since then,

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,350
I haven't been able to even look at another woman.

27
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,060
Except for the old lady on the subway

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,270
who break-dances for nickels.

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,620
I don't look at her that way.

30
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,730
I just look at her.

31
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,400
I mean,it's an old lady break-dancing.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,060
And she is good.

33
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,540
I'm going to give her a dollar next time.

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,120
Hey,let's pretend I just said this:

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,710
These elevator rides have been the highlight of my week,

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,300
and I'd love to see you again Friday night.

37
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,870
Not in the elevator.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,160
At a rtaurant, a nice one.

39
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,080
What do you say?

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,510
Yes.

NARRATOR: Kids,I walked in on a lot of crazy stuff

45
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,620
at the old apartment over the years.

46
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,400
Sorry,guys. I'm just going to go with a bowl of fruit.

47
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,920
It's been 12 minutes!

48
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,580
Drop it! You first!

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,220
Ike,why are you pointing your gun at me?

50
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,240
Don't use my name!

51
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,120
Put the guns down,now!

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,100
But one of the craziest things I ever walked in on

53
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,050
happened when I was roommates with your Aunt Robin.

54
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,350
Hey.

55
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,710
Hey.

56
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:13,890
Who are you?!

57
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,680
I'm Mitch.

58
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,150
What you doing,Mitch?

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,670
Oh,you must be the roommate.

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,620
I'm on a date with Robin.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,030
She had to step outside to take a call.

62
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,670
I guess her cell phone doesn't work in here.

63
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,270
Oh...

64
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,170
Ohh!

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,640
OhRobin,uh,didn't use the super secret signal.

66
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,350
We-we put this old takeout menu on the doorknob.

67
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,090
Place went out of business.

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,560
Mr. Wang's...

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,030
Guess I don'have to explain why that's funny.

70
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,550
I'm going to go.

71
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,950
Um,when you leave,

72
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,130
take the seat cushion with you. That's trash now.

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,270
I think that I am more than qualified for the job.

74
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,450
My weaknesses? Um...

75
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,570
I would say caring too much, working too hard,

76
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,450
and putting my career in front of my love life.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,370
Whoops,that last one was real.

78
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,930
What?!

79
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,440
TED: Well,it appears our sweet,

80
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,650
innocent,little Robin has taken a lover.

81
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,080
A young blade by the name of Mitch.

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,620
No,her blind date? Uh-uh. Total bust.

83
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,570
She's been sending me text messages all night.

84
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,690
She just let him go upstairs to use the bathroom a second ago.

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,530
Excuse me a minute.

86
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,020
Ah!

87
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,040
Buddy,you are killing me.

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,550
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.

89
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,610
Middle of what?!

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,640
This is my move.

91
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,010
It's called,"The Naked Man."

92
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,230
"The Naked Man"?

93
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,600
Goes like this:

94
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,890
You're on a first date, you've had a few drinks,

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,610
MITCH: You make an excuse to go up to the girl's apartment.

96
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,690
So,the bathroom's right there.

97
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,020
||You know what, I'm going to grab this.

98
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,700
Okay.

99
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,250
Hello?

100
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,340
Then,once she leaves the room,

101
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,990
you strip down naked and wait.

102
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,180
When she comes back, she laughs.

103
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,310
She's so charmed by your confidence and bravado,

104
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,480
she sleeps with you. Boom!

105
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,730
There is no way that works!

106
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,000
Two out of three times.

107
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,520
Two out of three times?

108
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,230
Two out of three times. You just have to pick your spot.

109
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,290
"The Naked Man" is best used as a last resort,

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,920
kind of a Hail Mary on a first date

111
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,600
when you know there's not going to be a second one.

112
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,540
How do you know there's not going to be a second date?

113
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,550
Ted,look at me.

114
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,790
I'd rather not,Mitch.

115
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,440
Robin is way out of my league.

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,420
I'm not smart, funny or handsome.

117
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,760
And as you can plainly see,

118
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,570
there's nothing impressive going on anywhere around here.

119
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,420
My only shot with a girl like Robin

120
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,740
is the element of surprise.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,450
And,let's be honest, a little pity.

122
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,380
It's shock and "aw."

123
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,800
This doesn't really work.

124
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,100
Two out of three times. Guaranteed.

125
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,830
No way.

126
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,960
Two out of three times.

127
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,570
He guaranteed it.

128
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,760
Oh,come on.

129
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,350
There is no way that's going to work on Robin.

130
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,380
She's going to walk in there,

131
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,000
take one look at that idiot

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,810
and send him packing.

133
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,320
Yeah,she migh kick his ass first.

134
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,550
Yeah,she might get her gun and shoot him.

135
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,950
BARNEY: Go,go!

136
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,010
My God!

137
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,350
It worked.

138
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,490
"The Naked Man" works!

139
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
This is going to

140
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,780
revoluonize the one-night stand!

141
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,720
This is like the forward pass in football.

142
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,760
The slam dunk in basketball.

143
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,890
The haircutting technique where they hold it

144
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,500
between thr fingers and cut right above it.

145
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,570
It's a total game changer!

146
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,320
Barney,this guy slept with Robin,

147
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,070
who you claim to be in love with.

148
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,740
How can you be excited about this?

149
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,040
Lily,"The Naked Man"

150
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,830
is bigger than me and Robin.

151
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,560
All these years,I have been busting my hump,

152
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,720
with my secret identities and my tricks and my gadgets.

153
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,560
I mean,I'm like Batman.

154
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,650
But this Mitch fellow, he's Superman.

155
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,630
He just rips off his clothes and he's good to go.

156
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,250
What kind of gadgets are we talking about?

157
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,350
So,this is what it's going to be like,

158
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,560
us living together? I come home,

159
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,500
and guysou're dating are just going to be

160
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,440
sitting on the couch,naked.

161
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,080
Well,I wish I could say no.

162
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,870
I still cannot believe the "Naked Man" worked on you.

163
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,800
Well,what can I say?

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,450
Okay,I went in there, and he was naked.

165
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
It was funny.

166
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,550
I laughed, he laughed.

167
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,330
And then it just kind of happened.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,440
I don't know.

169
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,130
I call "slut!"

170
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,530
Slut?! Oh?! Oh...!

171
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,250
Excuse me?

172
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm sorry,Robin,but you hooking up with this guy

173
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,500
makes it seem like the only thing standing

174
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,690
between you and sex is clothes.

175
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,270
I didn't just sleep with Mitch because he was naked.

176
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,530
Then why did you sleep with him?

177
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,560
Because...he,um...

178
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,790
He,uh...uh,because I care about Mitch.

179
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,410
A lot.

180
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,620
There was a,uh, connection of specialness.

181
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,760
Of,uh,specialness and feelings.

182
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,700
It was because he was naked.

183
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,510
And I'm sorry, but I don't approve.

184
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,550
There is only one reason to sleep with somebody,

185
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,930
and that is "love."

186
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,440
: Oh,ha,ha,ha,ha!

187
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,270
Yeah,Marshall's a big girl because he believes in true love

188
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,780
and just finished reading The Notebook

189
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,250
because the secretaries bullied him into

190
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,150
joining Oprah's Book Club.

191
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,650
Fine! But you know I'm right.

192
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,420
Marshall, I love you,

193
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,490
but there's lots of reasons to have sex.

194
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,680
Name one. I can name 50. No,you can't.

195
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,230
Number one: last Thursday.

196
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,680
Hey,Marshall, want to do it?

197
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm up.

198
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,190
You befouled our marital bed

199
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,910
because you couldn't get to sleep?!

200
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,400
You're the one who said,

201
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,850
"That shadow on the ceiling

202
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,540
"looks like a scary toothless clown.

203
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,370
Good night,Lily."

204
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,430
Fine! That's one. But I defy you to name...

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm going to name 50.

206
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,200
There's "makeup" sex... Ooh.

207
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,890
"breakup" sex, Hmm...

208
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,780
and "your friend just told you about a new-position" sex.

209
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,740
You're welcome.

210
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,340
There's also "revenge",

211
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,120
"rebound", Mm-hmm.

212
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,530
"paratrooping."

213
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,570
You know,when you go out of town but instead of getting

214
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,530
a hotel room,you go straight to a bar with the sole intention

215
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,500
of hooking up with a girl so you have a place to stay.

216
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,470
Oh,you mean "banging for roof."

217
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,790
: Slut!

218
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,260
I dot do it.

219
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,720
My college roommate did it.

220
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,660
Oh,no,no,Robin, I just have a bad cough.

221
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,010
: I don't really have a bad cough.

222
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,930
: We all know

223
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,350
"college roommate" means you,slut!

224
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,300
Does anyone have a lozenge?

225
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,920
Ooh,ooh,ooh, I've got one.

226
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,060
"Nothing good on television" sex.

227
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,560
Mm.

228
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,350
"Hotel room" sex.

229
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,870
"Curiosity,"

230
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:52,830
as in...

231
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
"I've always wondered what it's like to have sex

232
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,340
"with a really tall girl."

233
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,160
Not a big girl, just a tall girl.

234
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:01,920
Like...

235
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,210
if a normal girl were seven, seven-and-a-half-feet tall

236
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,040
and wore a denim miniskirt.

237
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,840
I would have to know what that is like.

238
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,790
Okay.

239
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,000
"He said he loved you,

240
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,580
but you're not ready to say it back yet" sex.

241
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,770
Forty-three.

242
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,610
"Wingman diving on the friend grenade."

243
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,550
Forty-four.

244
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,070
"The condoms are about to expire."

245
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,480
Forty-five.

246
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,170
Wow,this is getting a little hard.

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,150
Forty-six!

248
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,570
Okay,four more to go.

249
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,340
Ooh! "You dropped a Cheeto on his lap

250
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,140
"and when you reached for it,

251
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,840
"he thought you were making a move,

252
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,780
"so you just went with it."

253
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,150
Well,thank you for ruining the memory

254
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,320
of our six-month anniversary.

255
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,200
You got me Cheetos.

256
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,410
Look,can we just stop with this stupid list?

257
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,980
Okay,you guys are making me sad.

258
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,580
No,I'm having fun.

259
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,340
Man,ts whole "one-partner" thing sucks sometimes.

260
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,070
I'm always talking about you.

261
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,110
I can't play "I never" because

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,730
then everyone would know all the weird stuff I let you do to me.

263
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,970
The only weird thing I ever did to you was

264
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,380
open up my heart and soul when all I had to do was

265
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,920
strip naked while you were out of the room.

266
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,630
I didn't sleep with Mitch because he was naked!

267
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,790
Mitch and I have something special.

268
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,820
I mean,fingers crossed,guys.

269
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,680
He may be the one.

270
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,200
The one?! Mitch?! The Naked Man?!

271
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,130
You mean the naked genius.

272
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,040
All these years I've been suiting up

273
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,910
when I should have been suiting down.

274
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,850
That's it. I am doing "The Naked Man" tonight.

275
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,190
Ted,so are you.

276
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,480
What? With the elevator girl.

277
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,230
Yore going out with her tonight,right? "Naked Man!"

278
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,330
No. Barney,come on, this is the first girl

279
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,720
I've had the courage to ask out since Stella.

280
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,440
"Naked Man"!

281
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,360
No,Barney,this is the eighth outfit I tried on tonight!

282
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,320
I got my hair cut three times!

283
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,230
I'm a nervous wreck!

284
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,200
Are you wearing makeup?

285
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,090
It's not makeup!

286
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,890
Okay,it's a sunscreen with a subtle tint of...

287
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,500
It's made for men.

288
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,480
Sue me,I want my eyes to pop.

289
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,280
"Naked Man"!

290
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,190
No,Barney, I like Vicky.

291
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,580
This could actually go somewhere.

292
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,130
I don't want to do anything stupid to jeopardize it.

293
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,070
Well,I really like...

294
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,380
that girl,but...

295
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,990
Oh,I didn't see her from the back.

296
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,910
I really like... that girl.

297
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,080
And I'm willing to jeopardize

298
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,020
our future together for one night of glory.

299
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,270
: Naked Man!

300
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,360
NARRATOR: So,that night we all set out to prove something.

301
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,380
Robin wanted to defend her honor.

302
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,990
Mitch,hey, baby,it's me.

303
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,450
Robin.

304
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,830
Do you want to grab some dinner tonight?

305
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:49,980
: Because you're

306
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,200
basically my boyfriend!

307
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,730
Lily needed to prove that she could finish her list.

308
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm stuck. I can't think of the last two.

309
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,230
Reason number 48:

310
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,040
To reinforce good behaviors

311
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,110
such as shaving and dental hygiene."

312
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,040
Oh,now you're conditioning me? Great!

313
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,540
That elains why I always get an erection when I floss.

314
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,180
I had to prove that as scary as it was to be dating again,

315
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,910
I was over Stella and ready to get back out there.

316
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,090
And Barney needed to prove that he,too,

317
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,440
could pull off "The Naked Man."

318
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,720
Hey,thank you for letting me look at your aquarium.

319
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,840
You're a real life saver.

320
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,780
Sure,no problem.

321
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,160
I just need to use the bathroom and I'll be on my way.

322
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,420
Ted,I'm doing it.

323
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,600
I'm doing the "Naked Man"!

324
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,760
Me,too!

325
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,550
doing it! I'm doing The Naked Man!

326
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,870
That's great!

327
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,410
What made you change your mind?

328
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,470
Welluh,the date with Vicky started off okay,

329
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,180
but it didn't go as well as I hoped.

330
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,880
Oh,my God!

331
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,700
Ted,you are so funny!

332
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,100
And can I just say, you have amazing eyes.

333
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,520
What,these old things?

334
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,710
Oh! Nice j,hot shot.

335
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,500
Save it! Go tell the manager he owes us an appetizer.

336
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,860
One of the ones with shrimp!

337
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,480
Me You're welcome. You were saying?

338
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,090
And then his cane missed the top step,

339
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,700
and he was falling,for, I swear,like two minutes.

340
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,370
Oh,God,I love old people.

341
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,560
Once I realized there was

342
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,270
no possible future in this relationship,

343
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,660
I just decided to go for it.

344
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,620
Awesome! Okay,big question:

345
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,280
What pose will you display your "Naked Man" in?

346
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,850
Huh. Wow,that is a big question.

347
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,110
I hadn't really thought about it.

348
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,420
I was thinking the "Superman."

349
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,100
Uh,what about the "Captain Morgan"?

350
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,560
How about the "Oops, I didn't see you there"?

351
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:57,910
The Thinker?

352
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,700
What about the Heisman?

353
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,430
Mr. Clean?

354
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,800
The Burt Reynolds.

355
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,070
It's so great to see you again.

356
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,020
I-I really had a great time last night.

357
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,230
So,what is it like managing a C.P.K.?

358
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,410
I mean,who's idea was it to put a pineapple in the...

359
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,690
Okay,stop right there.

360
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,080
I know what this is.

361
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,180
I've been on this date before.

362
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,830
This ithe "I'm not a slut" date.

363
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,480
What? That's crazy.

364
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,540
Usually you read me so well, but this time you're wrong.

365
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,620
Come on,Robin.

366
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,670
One of us had a good time last night,

367
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
and we both know it was me.

368
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,740
Oh,Mitchell Something,

369
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,540
that is,that is just not true!

370
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,670
Really? How was the sex?

371
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,010
I didn't hate it.

372
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,790
Robin,you've seen my move. That's it.

373
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,510
I have nothing else to offer you.

374
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,020
I'm broke,I sweat when I eat,

375
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,460
and I'm in,like,five different fantasy football leagues.

376
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,450
It's all I talk about.

377
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,530
Trust me,you don't want to be around that.

378
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,430
What? Yes,I do!

379
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,730
Look,I didn't just sleep with you because you were naked.

380
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,520
Yeah,you did.

381
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,500
And now you're trying to pretend it was something more

382
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,960
to make yourself feel better.

383
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,080
Say what you will,

384
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,250
at least "The Naked Man" is honest.

385
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,900
What about the ol' "Coppertone Baby"?

386
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,800
The Olympic gymnast who stuck the landing.

387
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,900
|| Hup!

388
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,640
Yeah,I got to go.

389
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:42,700
Naked Man!

390
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,930
You have a really nice place!

391
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,920
Oh,thanks! Coming from you, that's a real compliment.

392
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,690
I just love that you're an architect,it's so fascinating.

393
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,730
I could listen to you talk about structural design all night.

394
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,220
And then I noticed, lying on her end table,

395
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
a book of love poems by Pablo Neruda.

396
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,750
|| The same edition I'd had since college.

397
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,610
And it was bookmarked to my favorite poem.

398
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,830
Maybe I was all wrong about this girl.

399
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,980
Maybe there was a future for us.

400
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,520
Crap!

401
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,740
Here we go.

402
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,380
Pablo Neruda.

403
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,700
Oh,yeah,that book's a turd.

404
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,030
Some douchey guy I hooked up with left it here.

405
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,220
|| It's all in Mexican.

406
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,750
You know who writes good poems?

407
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,190
VICKY: Jewel. Her teeth are crooked and she lived in a car.

408
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,660
So,she has stuff to write about.

409
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,490
Ta-dah!

410
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,110
Okay.

411
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,180
"The Naked Man" works!

412
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,080
I just had decent sex with an awful human being.

413
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,010
I am back!

414
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,510
Congratulations,buddy.

415
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,610
You're not the only one who rocked "The Naked Man" tonight.

416
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,290
You just want to do it to change the subject.

417
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah.

418
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,020
Hey,that's number 49!

419
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,080
Did it work?

420
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,390
It's like I just flossed.

421
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,870
I love you.

422
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,830
That's 50.

423
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,250
Oh,yeah...

424
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,040
Nice! What pose did you go with?

425
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,750
I went with "I've got boobs."

426
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,940
And she nailed it.

427
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,610
Oh,my God! Guys,guys,guys!

428
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,870
This is him!

429
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,160
This is "The Naked Man"!

430
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,370
Um,Ted,his name is Mitch.

431
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,810
And,um,he's my boyfriend. So...

432
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,540
It's okay,Robin. I no longer call "slut."

433
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,480
Oh,okay. You can go.

434
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,670
We're done. Thanks.

435
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,010
Hold on, Mitch,Mitch,

436
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,180
I have to thank you.

437
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,200
We all tried "The Naked Man" tonight.

438
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:55,940
Oh!

439
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,700
Ooh,wshould see how Barney did.

440
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,730
Hello?

441
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,680
Hi,is,uh, is Barney there?

442
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,520
No.

443
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,210
Oh,my God! What's the matter with you?!

444
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,650
Get out!

445
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,270
I just have to grab my suit. It's very expensive.

446
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,090
The tie alone... Get out of here right now!

447
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,250
Get out,you sick son of a bitch! Call me.

448
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,070
And if I see him again, I'm calling the cops.

449
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,250
Two out of three times.

450
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,100
Mitch,I want you to know, this night,crazy as it was,

451
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,530
it got me out of my shell.

452
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,610
That's the beauty of "The Naked Man."

453
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,140
It gives you exactly what you need.

454
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,830
No more,no less.

455
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,470
Now,if you'll excuse me,

456
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,440
I need to replace one of my fantasy football quarterbacks.

457
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,510
He separated his shoulder!

458
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,470
A toast... to Mitch.

459
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,180
By the sum of his parts,

460
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,640
he is just a man.

461
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,050
But by what he does with those parts,he becomes so much more.

462
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,100
TED: He may not fit society's definition of a hero,

463
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,500
but he is the hero I needed.

464
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,080
The hero who helped me recover from the disaster

465
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
of my failed almost-marriage and get back into the game.

466
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,310
He lives in the shadows. Is he a dream?

467
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,700
Truth? Fiction? Damnation? Salvation?

468
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,900
He is all these things and none of them.

469
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,820
For he is...

470
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,580
"The Naked Man."

471
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,460
Oh,thank God.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
