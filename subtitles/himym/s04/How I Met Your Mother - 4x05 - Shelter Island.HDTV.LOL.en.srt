1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,000
AHey. Hey,guys,how's it going?

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,930
I'm just gonna finish this.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,300
We just had dinner with Stella's sister and her fianc?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
They're getting married before us.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,430
Okay,you know how you've dreamt

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,630
about your perfect wedding day

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,700
ever since you were a little girl?

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,600
Yeah. Totally.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,400
My sister is stealing my dream wedding.

10
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,500
Down to every last detail--  <i>on</i> Shelter Island,<i>at</i> sunset,

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,430
...just down the beach from our family's

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,200
old summer house.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,530
It's my dream wedding.

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,460
Hmm.

15
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,060
I'm gonna finish this.

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,330
Uh,the lamb here is supposed to be great.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,600
Oh. I'm a vegan.

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,860
I wish Icould tune out that moral voice

19
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,300
inside me that says eating animals is murder,

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,000
but I guess I'm just not as strong as you are.

21
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,900
That's 'cause you need protein.

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,300
I'll have the lamb.

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,760
Okay,new goal: I want our wedding

24
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,260
to kick her wedding's ass.

25
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,660
I want our wedding

26
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,760
to take her wedding's head and shove it in the toilet

27
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,430
and flush it,like,20 times.

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh,Ted,in high school,you were her wedding,weren't you?

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,830
You know,she's always trying to one-up me.

30
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,360
I mean,I lo her,but...

31
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,230
there's a little part of me that kinda wishes

32
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,660
this whole thing would just fall apart.

33
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,660
I hate him.

34
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,900
I hate him.

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,100
I hate him!

36
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,300
God,thissteak is <i>so</i> good!

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,130
Four days to g and he just runs off

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,660
with the vitamin consultant from Whole Foods?

39
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,500
I gave up makeup for him.

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,500
I gave up showering for him.

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,130
I gave up shaving my armpits for him.

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,460
Hard to imagine where it all went wrong.

43
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,860
And now it's so close to the wedding...

44
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,030
There's like bacon or something

45
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,100
in this dipping sauce. I love it.

46
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,400
I can't get any refunds.

47
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,130
I'm gonna be out thousands of dollars.

48
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,860
NARRATOR:  <i>Kids,when you're</i>  <i>in a relationship,</i>

49
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,560
<i>you develop a kind</i>  <i>of telepathy with your partner.</i>

50
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,230
STELLA (thinking):  <i>What do you think?</i>

51
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>We could help her out.</i>

52
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,030
TED (thinking):  <i>No,Stella,we</i> should  <i>help her out.</i>

53
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,660
<i>Let's pay for dinner.</i>

54
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Nora.

55
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,360
Don't worry.

56
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,430
We got this.

57
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,830
That's right.

58
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,360
We'll take over your wedding, pay you back

59
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,030
for everything you spent.

60
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,760
Ted and I will get married this Sunday.

Wow. We're getting married this Sunday?

65
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,900
Are we sure we're ready for this?

66
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,260
Ted,I wasted years trying to get Lucy's dad

67
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,260
to decide he was "ready" for this,

68
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,700
but he never got ready for this.

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,560
That's why we never got married.

70
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,160
Come on,let's just be spontaneous.

71
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,230
I used to dream that Tony would be spontaneous like this.

72
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,160
Okay,I'm in.

73
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,800
And I'm also... spontaneous.

74
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,930
I wish I hadn't done that.

75
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,160
<i>Kids,morals usually</i>  <i>come at the end of stories,</i>

76
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,430
<i>but this one is so important,</i>  <i>I'm gonna tell you now:</i>

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,960
<i>Don't ever,ever invite an ex</i>  <i>to your wedding.</i>

78
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,800
<i>If someone had given me</i>  <i>that advice,</i>

79
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,500
<i>well,it would have changed</i>  <i>everything.</i>

80
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,000
Come on,you've got to come, it's my wedding.

81
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,830
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,530
It's my first week on the job.

83
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,130
I can't just take off.

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,160
Plus,I'm finally doing serious news.

85
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,030
<i>Robin was doing serious news.</i>

86
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,030
<i>It was the number one</i>  <i>English news network in Japan.</i>

87
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,000
<i>Of course,the news was</i>  <i>a little different over there.</i>

88
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,500
(yelling in Japanese)

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
(fan whirs)

90
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,560
The Federal Reserve Board voted to leave interest...

91
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,430
rates unchanged.

92
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,730
It's my wedding.

93
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,160
You have to be there.

94
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,360
Okay. Okay. I'll be there.

95
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,430
Whoops,I gotta go.

96
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,500
Good evening.

97
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,900
(chittering)

98
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,200
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

99
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,700
Peace talks were stallednce again in the Middle East.

100
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,200
Despite a promising start in the latest negotiations,

101
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,660
talks foundered on security issues.

102
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,400
||She's in.

103
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,330
Oh...! Yes!

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
All right,Ted,

105
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,860
your bachelor party,tonight.

106
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,560
I have got three of the most physically

107
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,960
and morally flexible exotic dancers you've ever seen...

108
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,000
Can't,there's no time. Okay,I'll let you know how it goes.

109
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,460
Marshall,we should really rent the cars

110
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,900
for tomorrow,huh? Sure.

111
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,030
(chuckles softly)

112
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,900
What?

113
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,300
No "Don't get married,Ted"?

114
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,060
No "You're making a big mistake,Ted"?

115
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,460
Barney Stinson...

116
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,400
are you no longer committed to t war on marriage?

117
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,530
No,I just know a hopeless cause when I see it.

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,900
It's the same reason I don't recycle.

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,930
Plus,Ted getting married is in my best interest.

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,400
You see...

121
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,400
<i>lately I've been working</i>  <i>on a problem</i>

122
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,160
<i>of the utmost importance.</i>

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,900
<i>I confess I was stumped.</i>

124
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,560
<i>Until one night I decided</i>  <i>to tackle it once and for all.</i>

125
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,400
<i>Then,at last,</i>  <i>I cracked the code.</i>

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
So you're back on Robin.

127
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,500
Hopefully.

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
I mean,this weekend is the best chance ever

129
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,830
to hook up with her again.

130
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,360
You'll never pull it off.

131
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,930
There's too many distractions.

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,360
The first drunk bridesmaid you see,

133
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,930
you'll have your head under her dress

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,560
like an old-time photographer.

135
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,530
Lily,don't cheapen this.

136
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't want to sound all mushy-gushy and romantic,

137
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,200
but this weekend,Robin is the only woman I'm banging.

138
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,630
<i>And so,the day before</i>  <i>our wedding,</i>

139
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,560
<i>Stella and I made the trip up</i>  <i>to Shelter Island.</i>

140
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,130
<i>With everyone else</i>  <i>not far behind.</i>

141
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
Zitch dog.

142
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,600
Z-Z-Z... Zog...

143
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,060
This isn't exactly where I pictured Ted getting married.

144
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,160
"The Namaste Yoga and Meditation Collective."

145
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,830
I don't know about you guys, but Nama-stay here

146
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,330
any longer than I have to.

147
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,560
Sweetie,go check in with that dirty hippie

148
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,260
over there and we'll get some drinks.

149
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,800
So,what scotches you got?

150
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,060
Oh,here at the center,

151
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,260
we have a very strict no-alcohol policy.

152
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,200
(gasps,dramatic music plays)

153
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,160
Great,and all the meals are included,right?

154
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,300
Yep,and they're all 100% vegan.

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
(gasps,dramatic music plays)

156
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,760
No.

157
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,400
I need alcol.

158
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,100
I'm not gonna get Robin with this stuff.

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,530
Look at this.

160
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,460
Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer.

161
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,800
My God,some of these drinks

162
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,230
could actually make a girl smarter.

163
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,630
What sort of hell has Ted brought us to?

164
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,560
There's no meat.

165
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,960
There's no alcohol.

166
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,130
It gets worse:

167
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,930
I'm 90% sure that guy you were talking with

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
used to be lead singer of the Spin Doctors.

169
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,430
(gasp,dramatic music plays)

170
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,160
Hey,guys,

171
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,130
Stella and I have a little problem.

172
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
Oh,the programs look great.

173
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,330
I mean,it's not our names on the front,

174
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
but otherwise,really nice.

175
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,430
Oh,hey,I talked to Robin.

176
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,760
She's nning a little bit late,

177
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,730
but she'll be here just under the wire.

178
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,500
You invited Robin?

179
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
Yeah,of course.

180
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,300
You never told me that.

181
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

182
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,460
Can I help?

183
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,060
You feel glad.

184
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,400
You like Robin.

185
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,760
Yeah,but she's your ex-girlfriend.

186
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,460
It's weird. It's not weird.

187
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,960
It is weird.

188
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,330
You don't get what 's like for a bride

189
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,830
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.

190
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,630
Oh,Stella.

191
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,200
Your new husband

192
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,500
used to nail me,like, three times a day.

193
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,030
Having exes around,

194
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,460
I don't know, it brings up...

195
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,360
unresolved things.

196
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,860
How do you know that spark

197
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,900
won't come back with you||r ex sitting out there?

198
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,600
Come on, we're just friends.

199
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,630
Plus,Robin and I already had our backslide--

200
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,300
last Thanksgiving, not even that long ago.

201
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,560
Did you place a large bet against yourself

202
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,630
in this argument?

203
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
She already got her ticket.

204
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,860
Ted,it's important to me.

205
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,060
I would never

206
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,560
invite Lucy's dad. I wouldn't

207
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,860
care if you did. To's great.

208
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:03,930
Let's invite him,too.

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,960
No,Tony is the last person

210
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,760
I want at our wedding,okay?

211
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,930
And Robin is a close second.

212
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,460
Robin's probably about to get on the plane.

213
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,230
Plus,she left a really important job for this.

214
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,700
Spurred by environmental concerns

215
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,130
and high gasoline prices, (chattering)

216
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,930
sales of hybrid vehicles

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,860
have risen 11% over the previous year.

218
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,200
at should I do?

219
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,200
I don't know.

220
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,600
I kinda get the no exes thing.

221
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,460
Why ask a iled romance

222
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,900
to come and watch your successful one?

223
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,400
It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners

224
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,800
to a World Series game.

225
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,660
It's weird for everyone.

226
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,700
What? No.

227
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,960
Robin has to come.

228
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,960
Right,she's,like, my best friend.

229
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,530
Hey,whoa. Whoa! Female friend.

230
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,830
My best female friend.

231
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,360
Hey! Whoa! I don't care,why fake it.

232
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
Dude,Robin has to be here.

233
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,430
|| She shouldn't come.

234
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,030
What are you talk... Justice Aldrin,

235
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,200
tie-breaking|| vote.

236
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,800
(sighs heavily)

237
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,600
Okay,wouldn't feel right without Robin.

238
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,560
But you ||don't mess with the bride.

239
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm gonna tell her not to come.

240
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh,no,Ted. It's the right decision,Ted.

241
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,600
This is gonna be,like,

242
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,030
the worst phone conversation of all time.

243
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,230
Ted,Ted,Ted.

244
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,900
Co-best man-- I'm on it.

245
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,330
(phone ringing)

246
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,500
Hello?

247
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
Robin,where are you?

248
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,060
Uh,just heading to the airport.

249
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,400
Okay,we'll see you soon.

250
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,700
Have a great flight.

251
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,560
Bad news.

252
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,630
I couldn't reach her.

253
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,500
o|?||||||

254
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,870
Okay,Robin's on her way.

255
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,100
You know what, I'm glad.||

256
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,570
Exes should be allowed to come to weddings.

257
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,230
I'll just tell Stella she's got to deal with it.

258
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,330
I think you need to be more delicate with Stella

259
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,430
about this whole Rob||in thing.

260
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,930
What do you mean by delicate?

261
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,400
Brides are under a lot of stress before a wedding.

262
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,430
|| I mean,of course, I held it together pretty well.

263
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,370
(laughing)

264
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,200
You don't remember?

265
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,900
(whimpering)

266
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,530
The florist just told me

267
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,770
the roses are more light medium-pink

268
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,170
than medium-pink.

269
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,000
Lit medium-pink!

270
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,730
(crying): Everything's ruined.

271
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,830
Our wedding site

272
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,230
uses a gravity furnace instead of forced-air heating.

273
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,430
That's the one thing I cared about.

274
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,430
(crying): Why are we even getting maied?

275
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,170
Blobbity-blah.

276
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,430
Wickity-wah.

277
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,400
Eeky,eeky,eeky,eeky whee!

278
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,900
(sobbing)

279
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,500
After a while,it's all noise.

280
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,600
Poor Stella's had to jam months of crazy

281
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,830
into just three days. So what do I do?

282
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,700
You wait for the next crisis, you solve it,you're a hero.

283
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,530
Then you bring up the Robin thing,

284
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
but this time she'll say yes.

285
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,230
Yeah,but what if there's no next crisis?

286
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,530
(chuckling) She's a bride.

287
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,830
There will be a next crisis.

288
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,730
There's an next crisis.

289
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,630
Awesome! What is it?

290
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,600
|| My daughter,my own daughter isn't coming to our wedding. What?

291
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,970
Tony's supposed to drive her up tomorrow,

292
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,430
but now he's being all petty about me getting married, and he won't do it.

293
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,570
It's been five years.

294
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,630
Why can't we just move on already?

295
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,770
So first thing tomorrow

296
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,530
I drive down,talk to him,

297
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,330
get him to let me drive Lucy up,

298
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,170
th,boom,crisis solved.

299
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,470
Stella's happy.

300
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,700
Robin comes to the wedding.

301
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,000
Hey.

302
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,970
You Barney?

303
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,330
Yes.

304
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,530
I hear you're a rl man whore,so listen up.

305
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Tomorrow night

306
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,400
I want to do things so dirty

307
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,730
and so depraved that I forget

308
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,500
that this was supposed to be my wedding.

309
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,030
I... I'm kind of here with someone.

310
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Bring her.

311
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,670
You're never going to make it.

312
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,500
<i>The morning of my wedding day</i>

313
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,870
<i>I made the trip back</i>  <i>toony's house</i>

314
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,170
<i>to get Lucy.</i>

315
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,830
Hey...

316
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,130
Tony...

317
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,270
Doing a little karate?

318
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,670
(yelling)

319
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,400
Sorry,sorry,man.

320
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,570
You just set off my internal defense alarm.

321
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,100
You got to watch these things.

322
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,030
Stay alert,stay alive. Right.

323
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,430
So what brings you here?

324
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,430
I thought you'd be off in some honeymoon suite

325
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
with my woman right now.

326
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,530
Not yet. Soon.

327
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,330
That's right, tonight's the night.

328
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,330
Yeah! Oh,man,

329
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
you are going to be sticking it to the mother of my child.

330
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,430
Actually,I' already stuck it to her plenty of times.

331
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,130
Why do I always have to correct people?

332
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,070
You and Stella.

333
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,130
You lucky dog.

334
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,170
I could just...

335
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,770
(yelling)

336
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,530
I'm so happy for you guys.

337
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,900
Yeah,uh,hey,listen, here's the thing-- uh,Lucy...

338
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,930
You can't take her.

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,100
Tony,stop.

340
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,300
Look,this is a big day for Lucy,too.

341
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,230
You're going to have to put aside your own issues

342
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,830
and think about what's best for hehere.

343
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,200
Whether you like it or not,

344
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,000
she really should be at her mother's wedding.

345
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,000
So,I'm taking Lucy with me.

346
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,970
You're right,man.

347
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,470
You're right.

348
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

349
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,430
It's just... seeing you guys...

350
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,430
has made me realize everything I had.

351
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,970
Hey,hey,hey... let's stop hugging.

352
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,930
I'm sorry.

353
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
Lucy means the world to me.

354
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,830
And I feel like I'm losing her to this new family--

355
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,570
a family I'm not even a part of. Oh,come on,sure you are.

356
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,600
No,I'm not. I wasn't even invited to the wedding.

357
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,100
Well,you are now.

358
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,230
Road trip.

359
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,100
(giggling) Right?

<i>Road Trip 2--</i>  <i>Back in the Car.</i>

361
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,230
So,today's the day.

362
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,530
You hydrating?

363
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,200
Dear femal thank you for your interest

364
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,200
in Barney Stinson...

365
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,070
Your back is going to look like a Jackson Pollack.

366
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,400
(moaning)

367
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,900
I regret to inform you that at this time...

368
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,500
I was a vegan for two years.

369
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,830
I need meat.

370
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,070
...there are currently no positions available.

371
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,570
I'm a yoga instructor.

372
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,670
Every position is available.

373
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,670
(groans)

374
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,330
Your room,20 minutes.

375
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,630
No foreplay. Huh... huh... huh...

376
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,470
I'm not going to make it,am I?

377
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,030
ot Not a chance.

378
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,630
(muffled groan)

379
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,570
Okay,just remember,

380
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,330
T1|| let me talk to Stella first,okay?

381
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,530
Mommy! Mommy!

382
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,670
Ted invited ddy!

383
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,870
Hi,sweetie. I missed you.

384
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,930
Give me just a sec,okay?

385
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,400
Hey. Hey,Tony.

386
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,470
Daddy. Hey.

387
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,700
You invited Tony?

388
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,770
To our wedding?!

389
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,930
Ted,we lked about this.

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,100
No exes at our wedding.

391
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,670
Why would you do this?

392
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:41,970
q|?

393
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,870
|| Ted,what is Robin doing here?

394
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,700
I thought I made myself clear.

395
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,930
No exes at our wedding.

396
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,770
To be fair...

397
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,500
your ex is here.

398
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,000
You invited him!

399
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,370
Come on,it's not weird.

400
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,370
It is weird.

401
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,400
It's like things

402
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,070
are not finished between you two.

403
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,030
And Tony...

404
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,570
I can't al with Tony right now.

405
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,730
Can you please go out there and tell him to leave?

406
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
You can make me the bad guy.

407
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,230
I'll go talk to Robin,so she knows it's nothinpersonal.

408
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,830
Okay.

409
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,200
<i>And,kids,if I had just let</i>  <i>Stella talk to Robin,</i>

410
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,170
<i>this whole story might</i>  <i>have ended differently.</i>

411
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,530
I understand.

412
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,230
I get it.

413
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,330
MAN: For the first time, Ted and Stella Mosby.

414
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,600
<i>And that's</i>

415
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,470
how I met your mother.

416
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,800
Blah,blah,blah.

417
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,630
Is your dad finally done yakking?

418
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,330
Now,come on, who wants ice cream?

419
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,630
<i>But I didn't.</i>

420
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,300
Look,can you talk to Tony?

421
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,870
Robin flew all the way here from Tokyo.

422
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,900
I should talk to her.

423
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,800
Sure.

424
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,330
Okay.

425
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,000
Hi. Hey.

426
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,030
Sorry about running off like that.

427
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,230
Oh,it's okay.

428
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,270
You would not believe the trip I just had.

429
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,530
I was on a plane for almost a full day.

430
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,900
But it is wortit to see you get married.

431
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,030
How could I not be here...? You can't come to the wedding.

432
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,200
Oh,thank God! What?

433
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,700
Ted,it's weird. It's not weird.

434
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,230
It is weird. Do you know how it feels

435
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,400
to be somebody's ex at their wedding?

436
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,430
Robin. Stella.

437
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,070
Oh... suck it, bitch! I win!

438
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,370
We broke up over a year ago.

439
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,970
Yeah,but that's not that long ago.

440
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,770
Watching your marry another woman

441
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,400
isn't exactly something I was looking forward to.

442
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,630
I don't know,

443
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,630
I just thought if I ever changed my mind

444
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,470
about marriage and kids,

445
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,700
it was... it was nice to know that you were there.

446
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,000
So,I was your safety school-- how flattering.

447
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,400
That's not it. It's just that...

448
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,270
Why are you bringing any of this up?

449
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,770
There's nothing between us anymore.

450
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,670
Well,maybe there is.

451
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,970
I mean,of course there is.

452
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,230
That kind of stuff doesn't just disappear without a trace.

453
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,330
Look,I'm not just another guest here,Ted.

454
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,670
Right. We used to date, but we both moved on.

455
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,100
And,look,we got what we wanted-- I'm getting married,

456
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,570
you got your dream job in Tokyo.

457
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,830
And they all lived happily ever...

458
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,000
I quit my job.

459
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,270
You what?

460
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm moving back to New York.

461
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,770
I thought I wanted that job, but...

462
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,700
I want to come back to my real life.

463
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,000
And I think you should go bacto yours.

464
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,100
What's that supposed to mean?

465
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,900
Don't get married.

466
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,130
Look,you're rushing into this.

467
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,370
It's like you're trying to skip ahead to the end of the book.

468
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,930
Ted,you're the most romantic guy I know.

469
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,930
You stole a blue French horn for me.

470
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,530
You tried to|| make it rain.

471
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,330
I did make it rain. It was a coincidence.

472
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,500
But after all that,

473
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,430
this is how your great romantic quest

474
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,130
comes to an end?

475
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,300
You're just disappearing into someone else's wedding,

476
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,200
someone else's house, someone else's life

477
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,700
without a second thought.

478
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,170
That's not the amazing ending that you deserve.

479
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,600
That's not Ted Mosby.

480
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,870
I love Stella.

481
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,270
She's the one.

482
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,170
If you reallfeel that way...

483
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,900
I guess it's a good thing you're not coming to the wedding

484
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,400
after all.

485
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,130
(sighs)

486
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Big fight?

487
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,200
|| Yeah.

488
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,930
Here...

489
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,970
It's on the house.

490
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,930
Just keep 'em coming.

491
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,730
Oh,God,do not keep them coming.

492
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Hey,Robin.

493
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,230
Barney.

494
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,730
I am having a horrible day.

495
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,170
I snuck some scotch in from the duty free store.

496
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,500
You want to join me?

497
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,630
Yeah,yeah. Let's go to your room.

498
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,600
|| Far away from this room.

499
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,130
And we can knock it back.

500
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
They didn't get me a room.

501
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,870
I was actually hoping I could stay with you.

502
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,300
No problem.

503
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,500
I just have to straighten up little bit.

504
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,370
|| I've got some clothes on the floor,and...

505
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,030
And a naked girl tied to your headboard.

506
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,300
Towels all over the bathroom. It's a mess.

507
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,670
So,anyway... give me ten minutes

508
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,270
to get the place in order... See ya,Barney.

509
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,530
TJ Um...

510
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,630
She...

511
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,530
Okay,let's do this.

512
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,030

513
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,600
