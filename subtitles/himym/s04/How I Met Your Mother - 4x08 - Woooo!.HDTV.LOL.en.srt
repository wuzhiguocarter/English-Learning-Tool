1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,840
Kids, in the fall of 2008,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,620
Your aunt robin was unemployed and a little bit adrift,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,180
So she valued her friendship with lily more than ever.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,910
Hey, so I hear marshall has to work late on friday.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,300
You know what that means-- ladies' night.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,230
Oh, actually one of the teachers at my school, jillian,

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,850
Is having a birthday party.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,470
Oh. okay.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,940
What?

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,800
It's just I've never even heard

11
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,290
Of this jillian person before

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,270
And suddenly she's, like, your best friend.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,770
You can't shut up about her.

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,300
Don't be jealous.

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,710
You and I hang out all the time.

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,570
Yeah, but marshall's always there.

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,710
We don't get a lot of quality time to talk,

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,050
Just the two of us.

19
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,300
That's not true.

20
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,540
So that's when the story gets really good.

21
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,670
So, we go to the, uh... hey.

22
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,590
...place.

23
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,760
And then that...

24
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,780
Guy asks about that thing with the stuff

25
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,660
That I told you about at that place that time.

26
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,570
Long story short--

27
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,970
Events transpired.

28
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,820
Oh, my god.

29
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,110
You and the guy from the mayor's office

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,620
Did it in the un building under the desk

31
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,900
Of the ambassador from zaire?

32
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,980
Nice.

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,320
I just wish we could have some girl time.

34
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,370
I love marshall, but he's always talk-blocking me.

35
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,860
So come out with me and jillian then.

36
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,850
Okay, but I don't want to stay out too late because...

37
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,010
Remember that, um, thing

38
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,600
Last month after I went to the place?

39
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,360
Well, you know who said it's fine,

40
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,780
But she gave me some stuff.

41
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,610
You still got that yeast infection, huh?

42
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,860
Marshall,

43
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,730
I want you to enjoy this moment.

44
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,680
What moment?

45
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,960
The last moment of you and I being even slightly

46
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,510
In competition for the title of ted's best friend.

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,480
Marshall's my best friend.

48
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,060
Exactly. it's a tie.

49
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,970
But all of that is about to change.

50
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,420
Ted, am I correct that you are an architect?

51
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,870
My best friend would really know that, but go on.

52
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,080
And what are you currently designing?

53
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,100
Actually, we're renovating the new york public library.

54
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,930
Wow, ted, that's huge!

55
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,410
No, not the new york public library.

56
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,560
It's the new public library in york, north dakota.

57
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,720
Their books are in 2 sections

58
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,720
Fishin' and non-fishin'.

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Then I think you are going to really like

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,040
What happened at work today.

61
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,500
And so, while those bribes

62
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,980
Did destabilize the regime and caused the death

63
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,420
Of most of the royal family,

64
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,960
It did lead to looser banking regulations in rangoon.

65
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,210
So yay us.

66
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,330
Okay, last order of business.

67
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,810
It's been decided we're going to move forward

68
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,490
With plans for goliath national bank's

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,780
New downtown headquarters.

70
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,300
Who's gonna design it?

71
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,300
Was my first question.

72
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,090
Who's gonna design it?

73
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,820
We've already approached one firm about it.

74
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,950
This swedish architecture collective called sven.

75
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Sven?

76
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,400
Sven?!

77
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,680
Sven was this swedish architecture collective

78
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,440
Revered for their bold, innovative designs.

79
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,050
I hated those guys.

80
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,140
I hate those guys.

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,510
Swedish architecture collective.

82
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,330
Lame.

83
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,260
Pretentious.

84
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,630
"we're not a company. we're a collective."

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,460
I know.

86
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,780
"we are swedish.

87
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,860
"we are so cool with our baguettes

88
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,600
And our eiffel tower."

89
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,190
Dude, sweden's not france. you know that, right?

90
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,580
Oh, it's france.

91
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,500
So anyway, I say to bilson...

92
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,960
Bilson, with all due respect...

93
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,350
No, I stand up, and I say to bilson...

94
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,890
Bilson, with all due respect...

95
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,020
Music. imagine patriotic music playing.

96
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,890
Bilson, with all due respect,

97
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,810
It would be terrible

98
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,590
If a job that could go

99
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,630
To a hard-working american

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
Architecture firm went to a bunch of french guys.

101
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,740
Where is our patriotism?

102
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,890
Our sense of country?

103
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,300
Our love of all that is...

104
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,420
Look, stinson,

105
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,350
No one hates every other country in the world as much as I do,

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,620
But you better have a point.

107
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,590
I do.

108
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,990
I know a fantastic

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,890
American architect who would be perfect for the job.

110
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,800
Ted mosby.

111
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,750
So, all you gotta do is come in, pitch your design,

112
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,150
I get the board to approve it, and the job is yours.

113
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,860
Do you realize what a hero I would be

114
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,530
If I brought this project to my firm?

115
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,800
And that's not even the best part.

116
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,050
All three of us are gonna be working together.

117
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,720
Ted can be on the conference call.

118
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,030
He can totally be on the conference call. what's the conference call?

119
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,150
The way it works is, one of us will duck

120
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,590
Into the other's office and say...

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,160
Marshall, the conference call's about to start.

122
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,190
I'm sorry, guys, I gotta go.

123
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,670
And then we go up to the roof of the building...

124
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,240
And drink beer.

125
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,450
This is awesome. mm.

126
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,770
Drinking at work.

127
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,420
We're basically mad men.

128
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,180
We are! we're such mad men!

129
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,840
I'm gonna go smack a secretary on the ass.

130
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,410
That's totally what they would do on that show.

131
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,270
What show?

132
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,830
And then, we throw crumpled up beer cans at pigeons.

133
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,310
I don't do that.

134
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
I totally want to do that.

135
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,720
Well, I am gonna make that happen.

136
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,140
Seriously, barney,

137
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,210
After everything I went through with stella,

138
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,570
Getting me this opportunity...

139
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,170
It really means a lot.

140
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,250
It really did. you see, kids,

141
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,420
When I became an architect, I had one dream--

142
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,450
To contribute a building to the skyline of new york city.

143
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,750
I wanted to be able to point to one of those buildings

144
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,640
And say, see that one? that one right there?

145
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,280
That's mine.

146
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,930
This job was my opportunity to do just that.

147
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,260
Wow. your friend's having her birthday here?

148
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,000
What's she turning, 19?

149
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,010
No. believe me, this isn't her scene.

150
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,390
She probably just didn't know what kind of place this was.

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,770
Lily! over here,

152
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,970
You sexy bitch!

153
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,710
We've got bottle service!

154
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,330
At school, she's so quiet and normal.

155
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,340
I had no idea she's...

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
She's a woo girl.

157
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,500
What's a woo girl?

158
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,500
Let me explain.

159
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,390
A woo girl is a type of young woman,

160
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,680
Who, like the cuckoo bird or the whip-poor-will,

161
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,300
Gets her name from the signature sound she makes.

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,830
Now, a woo can be elicited in many different ways.

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
From a certain song coming on the jukebox...

164
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,590
Oh, my god, this song is totally about me.

165
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,310
...to half-priced shots.

166
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,780
From a ride on a mechanical bull...

167
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,430
...to, well, pretty much anything.

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,330
Oh, my god, I was worried that I didn't feed the cat,

169
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,080
But then I remembered that I did.

170
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,950
I swear, at school jillian seems so un-woo-y.

171
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,280
Yeah, she doesn't look wooish.

172
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,150
Maybe she only observes

173
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,220
The high holidays, like mardi gras and spring break.

174
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,630
Maybe she's just a cultural woo.

175
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,790
Now, uh, go easy on me.

176
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,140
It's a work in progress.

177
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,100
Ted, this is amazing.

178
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,370
The detail.

179
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,200
The shading.

180
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,140
The playfulness of the lines.

181
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,010
This is exactly what princess leia would look like topless.

182
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,950
My way of saying thanks.

183
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,240
So, uh, you want to see my designs for the building?

184
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,350
Nah, I'm good.

185
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,340
So get this.

186
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,510
Lily just texted me.

187
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,380
She's at that bar giddyups with a bunch of woo girls.

188
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,800
Oh, my god, you guys,

189
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,810
My boob just fell out of my top at the bar.

190
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,630
Trick! I pulled it out for a free drink!

191
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,090
So, jillian, I hear when you're not flashing bartenders,

192
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,620
You teach the second grade.

193
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,630
What's that like?

194
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,630
So rewarding.

195
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,740
I don't know if you're familiar with the rie technique,

196
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,370
But it derives from the progressive educational

197
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,370
Philosophy of rudolf steiner,

198
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,910
Who founded the waldorf school, which...

199
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,460
Oh, my god. I love this song!

200
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,830
Come on, you lazy skanks, let's dance!

201
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,530
You, too, you dumb whores.

202
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,050
No, thank you...

203
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,660
Ya ignorant hussy.

204
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
Why, lily aldrin,

205
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,360
You sly minx.

206
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,190
I've been saying for years

207
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,630
That our gang needed a woo girl,

208
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,600
And here you've been hiding a whole batch of them from me.

209
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,300
We do not need a woo girl.

210
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,730
No one needs a woo girl.

211
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,130
Be careful, lily.

212
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,710
The world absolutely needs woo girls.

213
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,330
If there were no woo girls,

214
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,090
There'd be no girls gone wild,

215
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,130
No bachelorette parties, no las vegas poolside bars...

216
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,620
All the things that you hold dearest, lily, would be gone.

217
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,960
Those are none of the things...

218
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,950
The souvenir shot glass industry would collapse.

219
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,670
So would the body glitter industry

220
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,640
And the stretch hummer rental industry.

221
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,650
Tiny cowboy hats would be worn

222
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,970
Only by tiny cowboys.

223
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,780
And when

224
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,460
"brown eyed girl" would come up on the jukebox,

225
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,860
All you would hear...

226
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,560
Would be silence.

227
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,670
And "brown eyed girl."

228
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,540
But who would woo, lily?

229
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,550
Who would woo?

230
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,190
Would you?

231
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,820
Would you...

232
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,810
Who wants to name my boobs?!

233
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,600
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date with hannity and colmes.

234
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,910
Over the next couple of weeks, I dove into work.

235
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,880
It felt great to be working on something

236
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,200
That I really cared about.

237
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,800
Finally, the morning of the presentation arrived.

238
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,580
And we believe this timeless design

239
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,010
Will radiate the strength and stability

240
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,440
That is goliath national bank.

241
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,800
Thank you, gentlemen.

242
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,330
I left there feeling pretty good about my chances.

243
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,970
Later that night, we ran into barney.

244
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,260
Hey, barney!

245
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,000
Give me the good news.

246
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,830
You didn't get it.

247
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,750
What?

248
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,690
The board decided to go with sven.

249
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,300
I can't believe I didn't get it.

250
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,370
I really thought I nailed the pitch.

251
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,250
Why would they go with sven?

252
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,650
I did everything I could to change their minds.

253
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,130
But they wouldn't budge.

254
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,490
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,390
Wow, this really sucks.

256
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,120
After the way these last couple of months have gone...

257
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,270
I guess I needed this more than I thought I did.

258
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,930
You want to go down to the current gnb building

259
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,510
And just, like... I don't know,

260
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,940
Just pee on it a little bit?

261
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,910
Yeah, I think I need that.

262
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,380
Finish your beer. fill your tank.

263
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
What happened?

264
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,300
Oh, ted didn't get that job.

265
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,310
But that's not

266
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,860
The biggest disappointment of the day.

267
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,949
What?

268
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,890
We saw you woo.

269
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,019
Saw who woo?

270
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,379
Saw you woo.

271
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,319
I didn't woo.

272
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,229
You did, too.

273
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,969
That's not true.

274
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,780
Your nose just grew.

275
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,909
You're, like, best friends with jillian now?

276
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,310
No. it's just...

277
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,889
You're married, lily, but I'm still single.

278
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,109
Whenever I hang out with you,

279
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,479
I'm usually the third wheel to you and marshall.

280
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,889
Sometimes, it's fun to go out with other single women

281
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,119
And do stuff that you don't want to.

282
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,330
Like what?

283
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,100
Like woo, lily.

284
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,590
Like woo.

285
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,699
I can woo.

286
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,539
That's not true.

287
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,399
I can, too.

288
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,010
It's just not you.

289
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,609
Bilson.

290
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,769
Yeah? hey. look, I just...

291
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,709
I just want to say, I know you guys went with sven,

292
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,769
But ted mosby is tremendously talented,

293
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,369
And I think he would have done a hell of a job.

294
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,750
I agree. that's why I voted for him.

295
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,689
So, then, it's agreed. from now on,

296
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,960
All atm fees are now called freedom charges.

297
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,020
Conference call. now.

298
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,440
You got something you want to tell me?

299
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,609
Oh, damn it.

300
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,789
I told heather to put everything

301
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,659
Back on your desk the way it was.

302
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,449
Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to ted.

303
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,770
So what happened?

304
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,770
Okay, fine.

305
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,059
...will radiate the strength

306
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,859
And stability that is goliath national bank.

307
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,260
Thank you, gentlemen.

308
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,270
So?

309
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,439
That was great. I love it.

310
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,209
Yes!

311
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,529
Looks like we got our guy.

312
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,910
I don't think we even need to meet with, uh...

313
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,729
I am sven jorgensen.

314
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,939
With me are sven pilsen and sven johanssen, and we are...

315
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,310
Sven!

316
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,219
You are goliath national bank.

317
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,449
You are cutting edge. you are new. you are fresh.

318
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,959
Women want to be with you, men wish to harm you,

319
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,130
But the fool who dares challenge you shall be crushed!

320
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,279
Your headquarters will tell the world of these facts.

321
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,320
Oh, and one more thing... don't look now!

322
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,509
Which of you is barney stinson, head of the search committee?

323
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,239
Oh, my god. that's me!

324
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,639
You, barney stinson, are a man of power and virility.

325
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,859
Your office shall be here,

326
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,950
In the head of a tyrannosaurus rex.

327
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,619
I never knew it till now, but I've always dreamed of that.

328
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,929
On your large desk of honduran rosewood

329
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,430
Shall be this button.

330
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,869
What does the button do?

331
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,140
Press it! press it for glory!

332
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,490
Yes!

333
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,489
This is the most awesome building in the universe.

334
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,259
There is no way this building could be more awesome.

335
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,710
There is a strip club in the letter "n."

336
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,109
What the hell is the matter with you?!

337
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,749
This is ted's big break!

338
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,299
And then you sold him out because you wanted

339
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,329
To work in the brain of a tyrannosaurus rex,

340
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,379
Which, incidentally,

341
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,599
If you knew anything about dinosaurs,

342
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,550
Is really, really small.

343
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,879
Marshall, this isn't about my office.

344
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,299
Ted's building was good.

345
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,439
Sven's was better.

346
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,479
And I am not going to let the fact that I am ted's best friend

347
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,969
Be a factor in business.

348
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,759
You didn't pick sven's building because it was better.

349
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,629
You picked it because you wanted to work

350
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,029
In a cool dinosaur office.

351
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,459
That's a lie!

352
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,380
I picked it because it-it...

353
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,190
It breathes fire, marshall.

354
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,330
"fire marshall."

355
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,589
Oh. I didn't even notice.

356
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,109
How could you do this to ted

357
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,089
After everything he's been through with stella?!

358
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,599
You're just being selfish.

359
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,299
Marshall, I would never

360
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,809
Make a business decision for selfish reasons.

361
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,289
I am a professional. now, come on.

362
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,159
Let's get a nice daytime drunk going,

363
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,309
And throw empties at pigeons.

364
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,189
No. no. for two reasons.

365
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,519
One, pigeons are smarter than you think.

366
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,429
They hold grudges.

367
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,859
And, two, this is our last conference call, mr. stinson.

368
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,079
There are repercussions to screwing over a friend.

369
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,849
Like what?

370
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,940
Like this.

371
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,229
Oh, my god, you guys. last night,

372
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,209
We raised $10,000 for my charity

373
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,490
To help combat childhood illiteracy.

374
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,620
It's a really serious issue.

375
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,709
Someone just earned herself an ass-first ride

376
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,760
Down the dance floor spank canyon!

377
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,349
Lily, what are you doing here?

378
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,759
Oh, just doing the fun things you single girls do.

379
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,209
What's with the plastic fireman's hat?

380
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,529
Oh, I didn't have a cowboy hat,

381
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,100
And today was fire safety day at school, so...

382
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,589
Oh, my god, bitch.

383
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,299
This is our anthem.

384
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,610
Really? who sings this?

385
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,100
Is ll cool j still doing things?

386
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,410
This is great, svens.

387
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,879
You guys are so much cooler than marshall.

388
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,090
He doesn't even own a unitard.

389
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,040
Who wants a brew?

390
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,059
I don't understand.

391
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,200
Where is the conference call?

392
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,110
This is the conference call. get it?

393
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,169
In america,

394
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,329
When we work late,

395
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,369
We lie about a conference call,

396
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,129
And we come up here and we drink a few beers.

397
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,289
It's awesome.

398
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,160
This is a waste of time. push-ups!

399
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,029
Misty, you are such a slut.

400
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,870
Let's do another shot.

401
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,579
You're the slut, you skank.

402
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,910
Shots are on you.

403
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,399
No, bitch, shots are on you.

404
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,200
You're such a whore.

405
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,409
You're all a bunch of prostitutes.

406
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,630
You probably have stds.

407
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,130
Um... let's go dance.

408
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,669
Lily,

409
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,589
This isn't working. you shouldn't be here.

410
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,639
Oh, I get it.

411
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,889
Because I'm happily married,

412
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,279
I'm some kind of loser?

413
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,769
Exactly the opposite.

414
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,259
Lily, why do you think the woo girls have to woo

415
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,099
When they win a game of beer pong,

416
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,149
Or when a hot guy takes his shirt off?

417
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,699
It's because that is as good as life gets for them.

418
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,629
They're really sad people.

419
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,469
And, when they hang out

420
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,219
With someone who's got it all figured out--

421
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,009
Someone like you-- it bums them out.

422
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,619
It takes away their woo

423
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,819
You're just saying that

424
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,039
So I don't feel like an old married lady.

425
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Look at those girls, lily.

426
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,499
Look at them and listen

427
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
To what their woo's are really saying.

428
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,160
i cry in the shower!

429
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,090
I've never been on a second date

430
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,170
What if i never get to be a Mom?

431
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm secretly in love with Jillian!

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,089
My career and love life are heading nowhere

433
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,180
Oh, those poor girls... a-and ted.

434
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,929
I-i just want to go give them all a hug.

435
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,709
Lily, right now I'm like them.

436
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,950
I'm unemployed, I'm single, I'm a little lost.

437
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,440
So every once in a while, I need to woo,

438
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,169
But when I need to talk about something real,

439
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,870
You're the one I turn to.

440
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,879
You're my best friend.

441
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,119
And you're mine.

442
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,369
And I promise I'll make more time for just us.

443
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,149
Marshall doesn't have to tag along to everything we do.

444
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,699
Hey, have you guys tried these purple hooter test tube shots?

445
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,689
I've had, like, five of 'em.

446
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,439
I don't even think there's alcohol in here.

447
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,909
Where'd you get that hat?

448
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,230
What hat?

449
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,749
We fired sven. what?

450
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,389
Yeah, those guys were idiots.

451
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,580
I mean, sure, they had some cool ideas--

452
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,569
Some really cool ideas.

453
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,949
Actually, I wonder if it's not too late to...

454
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,989
No!

455
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,369
The point is 

456
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,779
You got the job.

457
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,809
Really? yeah.

458
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,570
The search committee realized they made the wrong decision.

459
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,089
Plus, you really mean a lot to them

460
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,180
And they want you to be happy.

461
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,630
That's weird.

462
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,659
Look, ted, your design was the best,

463
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,080
And you deserve it.

464
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,709
There's also something that you should know

465
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,740
About why you didn't get the job in the first place.

466
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,850
You see, ted... it was bilson.

467
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,110
Bilson just wanted to have an office in a dinosaur head,

468
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,619
But barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.

469
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,740
Well, you know.

470
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,950
Thank you, barney.

471
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,539
I can't believe this.

472
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,769
I-i-i just got our firm

473
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,680
The biggest account we've ever had.

474
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,680
Now only my love life's a disaster.

475
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,660
Next round's on me.

476
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,950
Why'd you let me off the hook?

477
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,309
You did the right thing.

478
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,840
Seemed like you deserved a bye.

479
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,869
Plus, it would have really

480
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,080
Bummed ted out, and he's-he's finally...

481
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,470
Happy right now.

482
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,600
You really are ted's best friend.

483
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,769
And so am i.

484
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,990
It's a tie.

485
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Thanks, marshall.

486
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,189
Marshall wound up caving

487
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,699
And telling me the truth about barney,

488
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,030
Like, ten minutes later,

489
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,739
At which point we tied uncle barney to the mechanical bull,

490
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,849
Cranked it up to a setting called "paint mixer"

491
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,300
woo! and went home.

492
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,609
I love you, man.

493
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,619
Love you, too, buddy.

494
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,379
Whew. hey, you going to ride the bull tonight?

495
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,739
No, not if you paid me.

496
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,310
I have an inner ear thing.

497
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,420
that was a pretty great night

498
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,380
Three hours.

499
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,920
That's a bar record.

500
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,170
That's right, ladies.

501
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,929
Jillian, you know what'd be really crazy

502
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,769
And funny and stupid to do tonight?

503
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,619
If you and me

504
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,770
Find a guy and have a three-way.

505
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,420
Maybe... if we found the right guy.

506
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,059
Yeah, and...

507
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,429
If we don't find the right guy, maybe you and I could just...

508
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,259
You know who was pretty cute?

509
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,660
That guy ted.

510
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,120
Let's go find him.
