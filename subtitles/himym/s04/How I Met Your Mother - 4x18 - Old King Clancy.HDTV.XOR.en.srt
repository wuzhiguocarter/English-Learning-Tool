1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,070
<i>In the spring of 2009,
I'd been hired to design</i>

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,650
<i>a new headquarters for 
"Goliath National Bank".</i>

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,100
<i>And I was eager to add 
as much of my voice as an architect</i>

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,050
<i>into the plans as possible.</i>

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,140
Woodbeams, bathed in natural light 
in the atrium.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,280
They're gonna love it!

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,860
<i>There was only one problem</i>

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,250
<i>and his name -
 was Bilson</i>

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,530
Wood? Natural light?!

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
Ah, no!

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,110
Natural light reminds the workers 
that there's an outside world

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,290
where they have family and friends.

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,100
We wanna crush that!

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,200
You show up in the dark, 
you go home in the dark,

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,170
You spend your whole damn day in the dark!

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,880
I need to hear Lily's voice

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
Who said you could leave?

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,480
<i>Bilson was killing 
every original idea I had.</i>

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,260
<i>Then, one day</i>

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,070
<i>GNB took him off the project</i>

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,220
<i>and created a new task force 
to oversee my designs</i>

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,960
<i>Suddenly, everything changed</i>

23
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,160
We'll have a roof top zen garden

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,060
for quiet contemplation

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,570
We'll have a reflecting pool in the lobby

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,190
where local children 
can come to make wishes.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,370
The New GNB,

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,800
A place of work -

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,690
that you can call "home".

30
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,520
Thank you, and um...
Welcome home.

31
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>Everything was going great,</i>

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,780
<i>until one day in the elevator..</i>

33
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,780
A yeah, it's Ted

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,450
No, no, no, no, no

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,710
I did not approve that change

36
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,490
for the blueprints 
for the new GNB headquarters

37
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,810
for which I'm head architect,

37
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,510
at only 30 years old..

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,400
Yes, I'm single, I'm not gift to charity.

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,010
What does that have to do with anything?

40
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,180
Alright, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.

41
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,810
You know that was a fake phone call, 
don't you?

42
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, and I also know

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,400
that the new GNB headquarters project 
was scrapped last month.

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,300
Nice try.

45
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,920
Check out Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars.

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,570
If I could nail any celebrity

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,240
it would definitely be Scarlett Johansson

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Hot, talented,

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,830
and nobody does that many 
Woody Allen's movies

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,430
without serious daddy's issues

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,940
If I could nail any celebritie, 
it would be Lily.

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,810
She's the star of my heart.

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,580
For me, it would be Hugh Jackman.

54
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,700
You know, I don't know, celebrities,

55
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,080
they're into some really weird sex stuff. 
Trust me.

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,380
How would you know that?

57
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,320
This is embarassing, but I...

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,620
I went home with a celebrity one night.

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,240
Oh my god! Seriously?

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,320
Yeah, he wanted to do 
this really freaky thing with me,

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,910
So I left. That's it.

62
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,970
End of story.

63
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,110
No, no, not end of story

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,100
I need to know who, what,
when, and-and where. Spill it!

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,080
Lily, be calm, please settle down.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,480
You're swallowing to much air.

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,400
But before you go any further,

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm flattered, but technically, 
I'm not a celebrity.

69
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,900
Plus, for the last time, 
I put the mask on as a joke.

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,410
OK, not you Barney.

71
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,970
OK, who is it?

72
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,750
Great, now you gave Lily the hiccups.

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,970
Ok, I won't tell you anything specific.

74
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,880
But um, all I'll say

75
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,340
is that he is Canadian born,

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,480
but you definitely know this guy.

77
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,480
And he got me back to his place

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,370
by offering to show me 
a very unique collection.

79
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,680
What do you mean collection

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,260
Well, you know some people collects

81
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
like stamps or coins, it's like that.

82
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,030
But I'm not telling.

83
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,170
Well, at least tell us 
the weird thing he wanted to do.

84
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,720
I don't know what you call it in the States,

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,270
but we have a name for it in Canada.

86
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,500
Look, I've already said too much.

87
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,380
So, mystery celebrity 
who collects a mystery item

88
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,290
asked you to do a mystery Canadian sex act.

89
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,040
Yes.

90
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,260
TELL US!

91
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,950
OK, I'll tell you.

92
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,250
But only if you guess all three parts correctly.

93
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,930
- Well, that's just impossible.  
- Exactly.

94
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,420
I don't even know any Canadian sex acts.

95
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,800
Well, you got your "Sloppy Dog Sled",

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,900
your "Alberta Fur Trapper", 
your "Full Mountie".

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,030
How do you know all these?

98
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,030
Canadiansexacts.org, 
it's bookmarked on the top right.

99
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,740
- "Dot org"?
- Yeah.

100
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,630
It's not for profit.

101
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,030
They really just wanna 
get the information out there.

102
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,800
Hey, so I just had the weirdest conversation.

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
This woman at GNB told me

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,780
that the new bank-building 
was scrapped last month.

105
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,940
It's crazy, right?

106
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
Wait, what's that look

107
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,860
- Should we tell him  
- I don't wanna tell him.

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,260
- I think we should tell him. 
- We're not telling him.

109
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,000
There was no look!

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,740
Guys, what the hell?!

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,500
Ok, it's time that you know the truth.

112
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,880
A few weeks ago, 
Bilson called us into his office.

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
We're scrapping the plan 
for the new GNB headquarters.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,570
This recession is killing us.

115
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,510
We're cutting anything non-essential.

116
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,900
And I have a lot of tough choices to make

117
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
at the bi-quartely retreat in Saint Croix.

118
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,660
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.

119
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,920
Not when he hears it coming 
from his best friend.

120
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,440
-I have to tell him ?
-I have to tell him ?

121
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,050
You should tell him, 
you're his best friend.

122
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm not, you're his best friend.

123
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm not, you're his best friend.

124
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,350
Quiet, here he comes.

125
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,390
Look, the white dude or the Asian fellow?

126
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,830
See? I bearly know the guy.

127
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,800
- Hey, Ted, what's up? 
- Hey, how are you doing?

128
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm frustrated.

129
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,490
Anything innovative I put in my designs

130
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,790
Bilson just hacks out with a machete.

131
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,900
I hate having to answer 
to a guy like that.

132
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
You should drop the project.

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,970
You should totally drop the project.

134
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,860
It's beneath you.

135
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,960
Then it's settled. 
To Ted Mosby's new chapter...

136
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,500
Are you kidding?
They just laid off another architect at my firm.

137
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,840
I mean, Bilson is a pain, sure,

138
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,220
But without this project, 
I'm probably out of a job.

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,770
Right, it's funny that you mentioned the project

140
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,250
- ..because...  
- You're nailing it.

141
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,620
Keep up the good work buddy.

142
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,960
Your hair and teeth look fantastic today.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,260
You're shining like a diamond!

144
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,030
Thank you.

145
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,830
I needed that.

146
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,900
All right, I'm going to head upstairs 
and keep working.

147
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,700
I got to find a way to introduce some wood

148
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,000
into Bilson's dark atrium.

149
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,200
I think you know what I meant.

150
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,460
- What was that?
- What-

151
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,860
I have a thought.

152
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
Okay, we're paying Ted's firm

153
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,500
for two more months of design-work 
no matter what,

154
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,800
so couldn't we just let him

155
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,960
keep working and not tell him?

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
He's had a rough year.

157
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,330
Let's let the guy be happy 
a little while longer.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,030
Marshall, what you're suggesting

159
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,430
is an elaborate,long-term lie

160
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,130
that requires tremendous commitment.

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,330
A nice guy like you can't pull that off.

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,330
Sure I can.

163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,660
Lie to me right now.

164
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,300
Okay.

165
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,500
I have a spaceship.

166
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,930
What kind of fuel powers your spaceship?

167
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,030
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.

168
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,660
No!

169
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
Stand your ground!

170
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,560
If someone questions you,

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,200
distract them from the original lie 
with more lies.

172
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,200
Here, let me demonstrate.

173
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,330
I own a pony.

174
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,060
Ask me a question.

175
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,830
Okay.

176
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,930
Um, what color is your pony?

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,100
Well, when I first got Dandelion,

178
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,100
she was a deep, chestnut brown,

179
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,230
but, sadly, her stable is located 
near a chemical plant,

180
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,930
which contaminated the drinking water.

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,400
So over time, she's turned a sickly, 
grayish-white color

182
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,530
and there's nothing that 
the vet can do to fix her.

183
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,030
My God!

184
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,800
That's horrible.

185
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,030
Is Dandelion going to be okay?

186
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,400
Okay.

187
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,400
All right. Huh

188
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,730
You are good!

189
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,360
Dandelion's not even sick, is she?

190
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,130
So the building's really dead

191
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,700
and you guys lied to me!

192
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,760
We, we just did it to protect you, Ted.

193
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
I can't believe this.
I just got screwed by my two best friends

194
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,000
and I didn't even know it.

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,060
In Canada, that's called a "Sneaky Snowplow".

196
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,200
That building was my dream job, 
and now, it's just gone.

197
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,460
We're so sorry, Ted.

198
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,200
Yeah, I need a drink.

199
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,960
Poor Ted.

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Would I seem heartless

201
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,500
if I switched us back to Canadian Sex Acts?

202
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,800
- Not at all.
- I'm surprised you waited this long.

203
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,360
What the hell is a "Two-Hand Zamboni"?

204
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
Let's just say, the only thing

205
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,100
the woman is wearing 
is skates on her hands.

206
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,130
A "Manitoba Milk Bag"?

207
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
Okay, it's like a "Chicago Mustache",

208
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
but the person on the bottom

209
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,430
is wearing a snowsuit.

210
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,230
A "Newfoundland Lobster Trap"

211
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,900
Don't know, 
don't wanna know.

212
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,930
Those Newfies are out of control.

213
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,330
Okay! Okay, 
I'm going to make my first guess.

214
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
Okay, but I'll only tell you

215
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,660
if you correctly guess the person, 
the act and the collection.

216
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,760
Okay, I'm gonna go.

217
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,630
Bryan Adams.

218
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,600
He collects baseball cards,

219
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,260
and he wanted to do a "Greasy Kayak."

220
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,700
No.

221
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,760
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,

222
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,600
a "Squatting Eskimo".

223
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,700
Nah-uh.

224
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,030
Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir shot glasses,

225
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,600
and a "Sticky Flapjack".

226
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,960
No.

227
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,860
That I would have done.

228
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,930
Wait.

229
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,630
Wait, if they pulled the plug 
on the project a month ago,

230
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,500
why have I been going in once a week

231
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,100
to meet with the 
New Headquarters Task Force?

232
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,060
Well, obviously you couldn't come in

233
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,230
and pitch to Bilson.

234
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,330
So, we.. invented the task force.

235
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,630
Then it was just a question 
of putting together the team.

236
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,730
You know Roy Waterman, 
Vice President of Capital and Risk?

237
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,900
He's actually...

238
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,100
Roy the janitor.

239
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,730
Hey. Excuse me, Roy.

240
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
How'd you like to make a few extra bucks?

241
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
How naked do I have to get?

242
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,630
Louisa Mendoza, 
Executive Vice President of Assets?

243
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,230
She's actually...

244
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,060
Louisa the lunch lady.

245
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,160
Louisa, I need your help with something,

246
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,100
but you can't tell anybody.

247
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,300
No hablo Ingles.

248
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,660
Exactly.

249
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,760
This is a big secret.

250
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
How do you say "secret" in Spanish?

251
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,360
Albondigas?

252
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,300
Ah, yes. Albondigas.

253
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,430
This will be our little albondigas.

254
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,600
Hey, can I, uh,
have a couple of meatballs, please?

255
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,430
And Arthur Nasmith,
the eccentric genius guru

256
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,300
of corporate investments?

257
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,760
He's actually...

258
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Crazy Arty,
15th Street's own one-man band.

259
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,360
Excuse me.

260
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,430
Do you have a minute to talk?

261
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,200
Actually, my assistant Reginald

262
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,260
makes all my appointments.

263
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,030
<i>We rounded out the group 
with a few interns</i>

264
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,430
<i>and payed everyone 50 bucks
to act super-interested</i>

264
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,230
<i>in what you were saying.</i>

265
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Reginald, get me out of this for next week.

266
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,660
That was some of the most 
inspired design-work

267
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,530
I've done in my entire career.

268
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,700
I was so excited.

269
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,000
Alex Trebek, a "Musty Goaltender",

270
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,530
- Beanie Babies! 
- Nope.

271
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Damn it!

272
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
Wait.

273
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,830
So that explains the thing 
that happened with Louisa.

274
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,660
- Good job, buddy. 
- Nice, nice!

275
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,930
Listen, Louisa.

276
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,660
What are we gonna do about.. this..

277
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,330
Don't act like you don't know 
what I'm talking about.

278
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,830
I know you feel it too.

279
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,830
Ahh, what the hell!

280
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,330
No, no puedo.

281
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,900
Me voy a casar con el senor Barney.

281
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,160
La vida es una!

282
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,430
No! No!

283
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,230
No, this is wrong!

284
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,460
For God's sake,
you're on the task force!

285
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,530
Is there anything else 
you want to tell me?

286
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,360
Well, um, you know how you played

287
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,260
third base for the GNB softball team?

288
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,430
There is no GNB softball team.

289
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,730
We just rented out a field,

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,000
rounded up a bunch of guys 

291
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,660
and told them
to make you the hero.

292
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,000
So my game-winning walk, was a lie?

293
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,500
We're sorry, Ted, but we knew 

294
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,900
that you'd be out of work soon, 
and we just --

295
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,300
we just wanted to make you feel good.

296
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
You know, that's what friends do.

297
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,530
Lie to each other?

298
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,030
Sometimes, yeah, 
to protect each other's feelings.

299
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,430
No way! 
You never lie to your friends.

300
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,030
I would never not be honest with you.

301
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,200
Really?

302
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,530
What about that open mic night
at the comedy club?

303
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
Are you like me, folks

304
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,700
Have you ever thought about how many

305
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,660
different kinds of fish there are,

306
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,600
And the names of those fish?

307
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,430
Let's, uh, let's take a little ride.

308
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,860
"Trout". 
Am I right?

309
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,560
"Sturgeon". 
I don't think so, pal.

310
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
"Salmon".

311
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,130
I'm going to say that again, "salmon".

312
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,100
Who thought that was a good idea, right?

313
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,360
"Bass." This guy over here knows 
what I'm talking about.

314
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,300
"Halibut."

315
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you, good night.

316
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
How was I?

317
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,060
Oh, you were great. 
Really funny.

318
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,400
You killed...

319
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,560
everyone's Thursday night.

320
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,900
Time out.

321
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,730
You didn't like the fish list?

322
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,800
It was horrible! 
You just read a list of fish.

323
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,530
Anyway...

324
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,430
You guys just proved my point, okay?

325
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,260
You lied to me, to protect my feelings.

326
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,630
This is completely different!

327
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,430
I just wasted a month of my life 
working on a dead project.

328
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,530
That's time I could've spent

329
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,030
trying to bring my firm new business.

330
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,960
Instead, I'm going to go 
in there tomorrow morning.

331
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,330
I'm probably going to get fired.

332
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,930
Best case scenario,

333
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,760
my boss is going to ream me out 
in front of everybody.

334
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,860
...
Back home, we call that a Sas...

335
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
a "Saskatoon Totem Pole."

336
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,930
Yes. It's on here.

337
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Good morning, lying bastards.

338
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,200
Anything you want to lie about

339
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,230
before I head off to work to get fired

340
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,000
- That's a nice shirt. 
- You're the devil.

341
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,100
Ted, what if we told you 
that we found you

342
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,360
a new project at GNB 
where you would be

343
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,100
redesigning part of the 20th floor?

344
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,660
Well, if that's a lie, 
it's an incredibly dull one.

345
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,060
What exactly would I be doing?

346
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,060
This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.

347
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,630
Basically, 
Bilson wants a room just like this,

348
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,330
only two stories up, on our floor.

349
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,530
Wait, what's an E.T.R.

350
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
It's the "Employee Transition Room".

351
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,300
- What does that mean?
- Well, it's a space

352
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,460
where a supervisor and an employee

353
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
engage in a knowledge transfer

354
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,000
about an impending vocational paradigm shift.

355
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,330
People get fired in here.

356
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,600
That's horrible!

357
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,800
Why do you need a room 
specifically for firing people?

358
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,130
Well, um, GNB feels 
that people need a safe,

359
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
secure space to deal with the news.

360
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,960
Yeah.

361
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,030
It gets pretty real in here.

362
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,630
<i>So I reluctantly agreed 
to design a room</i>

363
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,300
<i>where people would be fired.</i>

364
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,930
<i>But I was determined to make it my own.</i>

365
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,900
Now, when you leave the dismissal space,

366
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,530
you'll exit into what

367
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,300
I'm calling the "Rebirth Tranquility Hallway".

368
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,430
Uh-oh.

369
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,300
Here, you'll find a soothing oval chamber

370
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,300
with a trained grief counselor.

371
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,360
It's right here, 
past the New Beginnings Fountain.

372
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,030
Uh-oh.

373
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,230
And there you have it.

374
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,060
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,

375
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,200
a nurturing womb...

376
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,760
birthing you into a new life.

377
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,900
I love it.

378
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

379
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,760
Nice work, Ted.

380
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Thank you.

381
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,100
Can you add some of these touches

382
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,260
to the existing 18th Floor E.T.R. as well?

383
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
- Absolutely. 
- Great.

384
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,660
Let's take a look.

385
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,060
Okay, so I'm thinking this wall..

386
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,060
You're fired!

387
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
What!

388
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,230
I wanted this room!

389
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,260
This exact room, two floors up!

390
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,030
But...

391
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,630
You're fired!

392
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,800
Now, get the hell out of here.

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
Hey, honey.

394
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,560
Anyone from the band Rush,

395
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,000
a "Montreal Meatpie", 
and superhero lunch boxes.

396
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,460
No.

397
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,300
Okay. Rick Moranis,

398
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,300
"The Reverse Rick Moranis",

399
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,860
antique Judaica.

400
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,830
- Nah-uh. 
- I give up.

401
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,160
I've been guessing for three days.

402
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,300
I-I-I'm done.

403
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,960
If that means I never get to know,

404
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,800
- So be it. 
- Fine.

405
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,300
Tell us!  Tell us!

406
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,660
Tell us!

407
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,230
Okay, you really want to know?

408
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes! Yes! Yes!

409
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,460
But this information,

410
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,160
does not leave this table.

411
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,100
Oh, my, God.

412
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,630
I am so excited.

413
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,700
- Oh... I'm going to read it. 
- Read it.

414
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,830
- I'm going to read it. 
- Read it.

415
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm going to read it. 
Here we go.

416
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,100
"The Frozen Snowshoe,

417
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,030
Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays".

418
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,730
Right?

419
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,760
I don't know what any of those words mean.

420
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,660
Is one of those supposed to be a celebrity?

421
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,400
Yeah, who the hell is "Old King Clancy??

422
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,630
No, that's not the person,

423
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,830
that's the sex act.

424
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,000
It's the same as a "Sacramento Turtleneck",

425
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,500
except with maple syrup.

426
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,160
So the celebrity was Harvey Straze?

427
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,030
No, that's what he collected.

428
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,260
Harvey's trays.

429
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,500
Those classic orange trays you get

430
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,730
whenever you eat at Harvey's?

431
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,430
The restaurant?

432
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,960
Oh, come on, you're road tripping

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,630
down the Trans-Canada Highway,

434
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,160
you get a hunger on 
between Milverton and Wawa,

435
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,330
where you gonna strap on a feed bag, huh?

436
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,060
Harvey's. Over 12,000 served!

437
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,630
So the celebrity was...

438
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,860
The Frozen Snowshoe.

439
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Oh, my God! 

440
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,530
You guys have never heard 
of The Frozen Snowshoe?

441
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,700
He's only the most famous

442
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,100
professional wrestler in Canada.

443
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,700
I met him after he defeated 
Reckless Rick Rogers

444
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,260
in the Kamloops Memorial Arena 
back in '02.

445
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,630
Classic match.

446
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,600
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe

447
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,830
invited you back to his place

448
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,960
to look at Harvey's trays,

449
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,060
and asked you to do an Old King Clancy?

450
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,530
Exactly.

451
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,630
And I'm serious, you cannot tell anyone.

452
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,160
Well, my hiccups are gone.

453
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,630
Possibly forever.

454
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,360
Canada!

455
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,060
You did it again.

456
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,830
You even found a way to ruin this.

457
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,730
Why do we let you be a country?

458
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,460
Hey, mister-mister.

459
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,930
Hey. Shouldn't you be upstairs

460
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,730
designing your big, fancy E.T.R.?

461
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,200
- I'm off the project. 
- What?

462
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,700
Bilson fired me.

463
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,830
You're kidding me.

464
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,300
So what does this mean 
for you  at your firm,

465
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,630
Are you going to get laid off?

466
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,600
Actually, I just quit.

467
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,600
Why?

468
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,160
Because I can't work for big,

469
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,030
heartless corporate clients anymore.

470
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,300
When I was pitching to your "task force",

471
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,400
I was doing the most inspired work 
of my career.

472
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,500
In a way, you idiots reminded me 
how much fun my job can be,

473
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
when I'm not answering
to the Bilsons of the world

474
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,700
So...

475
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,460
I quit.

476
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,430
They fired you, didn't they?

477
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,330
Yes, sir.

478
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,930
But, I got a sweet severance package

479
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,460
and I've made a big decision.

480
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,630
I'm going to start my own firm.

481
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,530
- Whoa, buddy. 
- That's exciting.

482
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,800
- Way to go. 
- In this economy?

483
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
So you're not mad?

484
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,360
As it turns out, I'm grateful.

485
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,560
So how'd it all go down 
between you and Bilson?

486
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,360
Well, after he proposed 
a vocational paradigm shift,

487
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I made an impromptu presentation 
using a four-pronged approach

488
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,860
that really brought him to his knees.

489
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,860
Hit him with a chair?

490
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,400
- Yep. 
- That's my boy.

491
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,030
And this one, I got on the drive

492
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,230
from Milverton to Wawa.

493
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,000
That's pretty impressive, 
The Frozen Snowshoe.

494
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,030
Please, we're friends. 
Just call me "Shoe".

495
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,400
Have a seat.

496
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,660
So, Shoe...

497
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,200
How would you like to give me...

498
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,560
an Old King Clancy?

499
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,930
I think you should go.
