1
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:02,779
<i>Why do we fight?</i>

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:05,024
<i>What is that thing
deep with any each of us?</i>

3
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>That compels us to settle
disagreements with our fists?</i>

4
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:10,709
<i>Whatever it is, it's there right
from the beginning.</i>

5
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:13,054
Okay, okay. Stop fighting!

6
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:14,130
Why?

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,432
Because it's stupid and juvenile.

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,935
We're six.
We are stupid and juvenile.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,084
<i>Kids, I've only been
in one fight in my life.</i>

10
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:27,254
<i>And this is the story
of how it happened.</i>

11
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:29,884
<i>Now, as you know,
I recently had been left at the altar.</i>

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,129
<i>And the worst thing about
getting left at the altar?</i>

13
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:34,658
<i>I mean, aside from actually
getting left at the altar,</i>

14
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,181
<i>was what came next.</i>

15
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:39,372
<i>A steady unrelenting
unbearable stream of pity.</i>

16
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:41,840
Vodka cranberry. Gin and tonic.

17
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,920
Scotch and soda.

18
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:49,382
Thank you.

19
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,566
- Could I see a menu?
- Ted,

20
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:57,723
I'm going to go get you a menu...

21
00:00:58,002 --> 00:00:59,450
but I promise you,

22
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:00,935
I will come back.

23
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:06,558
Okay, we have to start
going someplace else.

24
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,120
At this bar, I'm always going to be
the guy who got left at the altar.

25
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:11,634
That sucks!

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:12,861
<i>Good times</i>.

27
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:15,498
- We lost Barney.
- What do you mean?

28
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,916
There's a girl over there
in a tight red sweater.

29
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,746
So he's not listening to a word
anyone's saying. Right, Barney?

30
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,238
<i>Give me a break!</i>

31
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,480
See, he figured out a while back
he could fake an entire conversation

32
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:28,254
just by saying titles of black
sitcoms from the 70's and 80's.

33
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:31,090
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- Hey, Barney,

34
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:35,011
want to go upstairs and do stuff to me
that I won't even let Marshall do?

35
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:37,251
<i>Different strokes.</i>

36
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:41,056
What the hell is this?

37
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,941
<i>I've told you kids
about Doug, right?</i>

38
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,812
<i>I haven't? Oh, well...</i>

39
00:01:45,474 --> 00:01:47,627
<i>Doug Martin was
a bartender at MacLaren's.</i>

40
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:49,275
<i>He was always kind of around.</i>

41
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,528
- Have... you met Ted?
- We're not playing "Have you met Ted?"

42
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,840
Am I dead?

43
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:55,880
Am I dead?

44
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,283
Tonight...

45
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:59,261
I pick up a lesbian.

46
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,163
<i>Anyway, three things
you need to know about Doug.</i>

47
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,799
<i>The first thing is that Doug
had a bit of a violent streak.</i>

48
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,814
... crumbled,
so he's on the ground, right?

49
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,797
And we're just kicking him!
He's making that face, all shaking.

50
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,758
So, anyway, what we did
was we left him there.

51
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:15,676
Top you off?

52
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,638
<i>The second thing is that
he was weird about his hair.</i>

53
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:21,790
What?

54
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:22,767
What?

55
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:25,129
Are you looking at my hair?

56
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,313
No, sir. I was not.

57
00:02:28,223 --> 00:02:29,273
It's a toupee.

58
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:33,486
Is that funny? You want to laugh
it up? Is it funny, guy?

59
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:35,988
Why don't you grab it?

60
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,471
- Excuse me?
- Go ahead, grab it right off my head.

61
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:39,591
Go ahead.

62
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:41,880
You don't want to grab it? Come on.

63
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,747
Come on, go ahead and grab it.
Want to grab it off my head?

64
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,089
Grab my toupee right off my head.

65
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,915
I like you guys!

66
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,671
<i>But the third thing is
that he was very loyal to his regulars.</i>

67
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,763
Hey-hey! There they are!
Hey, you guys want your booth?

68
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,101
- Oh, no. We're fine over here.
- Yeah? Yeah?

69
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,703
<i>Maybe a little too loyal.</i>

70
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:06,234
No, it's fine, it's fine.

71
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:09,146
You two lovebirds! Let's take
this somewhere else booth's reserved.

72
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,580
Let's go! Now! Come on!

73
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:14,438
Let's see some hustle, Father.
Up you get.

74
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:15,903
Okay, guys, here we are!

75
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:18,164
<i>So, that's Doug.</i>

76
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:21,363
- What the hell is this?
- Some guys are sitting in our booth.

77
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:23,379
But you know what? This is fine.

78
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,609
Let's go, I'll take care of it.

79
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:31,043
Oh, boy, there he goes.

80
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:40,848
Ladies, if you'll please
adjourn to your usual booth.

81
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:43,264
Gentlemen, I will require
your assistance outside.

82
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:44,557
Our assistance?

83
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,156
We're going to go out in the
alley and fight those guys.

84
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,053
What's happening now?

85
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,126
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

86
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:04,994
I'm sorry, did you just say...

87
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,828
Those guys
are being inconsiderate, okay?

88
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,416
So we're going to go outside
and cave in their skulls, OK?

89
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,108
This will be fun!

90
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:16,848
He wants us to fight?
Like,

91
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,591
Like, with our hands and stuff?

92
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:21,629
And feet maybe?
I don't know what the rules are.

93
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:23,215
A fight.

94
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:25,514
- Should we go out there?
- Come on,

95
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,788
there's only 3 things
you'll ever see me fight:

96
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:29,351
the stubborn clasp of a bra,

97
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,471
Sexual harassment charges,
nine for nine,

98
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,769
and the urge to vomit
when I see someone wearing

99
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:39,084
brown shoes with a black suit.

100
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:44,184
Dude, fighting is for losers.
We're civilized guys.

101
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:47,332
Civilized guys don't fight.
Unless it's with lightsabers.

102
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:49,246
But that's like three
to five years away...

103
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,755
- Well, that's not true.
- Robin, I'm on the forums every day.

104
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,504
Three to five
Thanksgivings from now,

105
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,782
I'm going to be carving
the turkey with Old Green.

106
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,462
No, I'm saying there are
plenty of legitimate reasons

107
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,934
to get in a fight,
it might not be pretty,

108
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:05,512
but in certain situations,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

109
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,390
Right, I forgot.
She thinks fighting's sexy.

110
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:10,645
No, I do not! A lot...

111
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:14,453
Look, I come from a culture
of hockey players.

112
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:18,025
If a guy can throw down,
it's somewhat way hot.

113
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,639
And scars, hello!

114
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:22,988
If a guy's got a scar,
he's got a Robin.

115
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,828
And if he's missing teeth?
I'm missing my pants.

116
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,662
I'm missing my wisdom teeth.

117
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,148
Outpatient procedure.

118
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:35,224
Local anesthesia.
Whatever. It ain't a thing.

119
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,681
- Maybe we should go out there.
- I can't believe

120
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,788
we're even having this discussion.

121
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:45,010
Ted, you're 30,
you're too old to act like this.

122
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:48,764
<i>I was 30 and in those 30 years
I'd been punched once.</i>

123
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,267
There's a very simple explana...

124
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,461
<i>There was that thing at camp.</i>

125
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,105
Today, we're going to braid
friendship bracelets.

126
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,441
<i>In college, I studied some Kung Fu.</i>

127
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,199
<i>And, there was some other stuff.</i>

128
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,914
The thing with the goat
wasn't for another few months.

129
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,378
The point is,
I had never been in a fight.

130
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,377
- I'm going out there.
- No!

131
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,359
Listen to me, please, trust me,
I've been in plenty of fights.

132
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,543
It's really nothing to be proud of.

133
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,217
Who did you get in a fight with?

134
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,391
My brothers.

135
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:32,224
Yes, I'm sure that was quite a rumble
in the Eriksen rumpus room.

136
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,394
I love brotherly horseplay!

137
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,669
- Here comes the tickle monster!
- Noogie patrol!

138
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:41,775
Wait, wait, wait!
Timesies! Timesies!

139
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:44,276
Cocoa break.

140
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,074
Cocoa break.

141
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,995
Okay, it's clobbering time.

142
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,924
Ted, don't do this,
you're a nice guy.

143
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,572
- That's your best quality.
- Is it?

144
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:00,435
'Cause I seem
to rember this nice guy

145
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,000
getting dumped by his fiancée
for a Tae Kwon Do instructor.

146
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,062
This may sound crazy, but I...

147
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:08,886
I think I need to do this. I think
this is an experience I need to have.

148
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:10,866
I'm going.

149
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:16,060
Me, too!

150
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:19,395
Guys...

151
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,706
take a good look at this face,
because the next time you see it,

152
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:25,778
it will be disfigured
in the hottest possible way.

153
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:29,044
Because that's who I am, I'm a man.

154
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:32,785
I like to fight and mix it up
and get all dirty.

155
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,756
Can you find a wood hanger for this?

156
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,253
- What happened here?
- I know, right?

157
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,964
Who's not looking at my toupee now?

158
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:47,633
Look what we did to these guys!

159
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,307
- "We"?
- Yeah, "we".

160
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:51,338
Come on, man, we're a good team.

161
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,138
Nice work boys! We did it!

162
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,641
No, no, you did it.
We didn't do anything.

163
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,702
Okay, yeah, yeah, sure,
I just beat up three guys by myself.

164
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,769
You guys. That's good.

165
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:03,304
You and you

166
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,361
free drinks for life.

167
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:13,046
He thinks we were
in this fight with him.

168
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,827
We were in this fight with him.

169
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:17,830
Now we are going to go
in there and tell everyone

170
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,666
the legendary tale of how
we beat up some guys.

171
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,753
And everyone is going
to think it's great

172
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,705
and everyone is going to
sleep with me again.

173
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,923
Dude, come on, no one is gonna
believe we were in a fight, look at us.

174
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,550
Oh, that's a good...

175
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,844
What are you doing?

176
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,709
What I should've done
a long time ago.

177
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:36,098
- What?
- I just hit myself in the eye!

178
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,298
I don't even know what I'm saying!

179
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,353
I throw an awesome right hook,
by the way.

180
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,272
- Are you ready?
- To go back in?

181
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:44,523
No, for this.

182
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,194
You punched me in the nose!

183
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:51,427
- Are you crying?
- Yes, I'm crying!

184
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:53,483
You just punched me in the nose!

185
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:56,595
That's going to swell up real good.
You're going to look like Owen Wilson.

186
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,057
Let's get back in there.

187
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:00,539
Okay, but just, let's just
play this down, okay?

188
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,908
I don't want this
to turn into a big thing.

189
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,644
And Ted comes
and takes his shoe off!

190
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,462
Hits him in the mouth...

191
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,847
Hey, there they are!
The guys that got my back!

192
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,354
You two got in a fight.

193
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,820
Really?

194
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:28,286
No, Barney punched me
and himself in the face

195
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:30,861
to make it look like we got in a fight.
Come on, Marshall!

196
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,298
Look at your eye.

197
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,225
You look like a badass.

198
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,027
I'm surprised to see
you had it in me.

199
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:40,996
You. Had it in you.

200
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:43,699
Do you...

201
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,819
want to touch it?

202
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:51,201
Oh, my God, it's warm!

203
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:55,035
Hey! Victory drinks!

204
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:56,884
Free!

205
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:59,028
Free! Free!

206
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,141
Free!
$7.50.

207
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:05,372
- Why do I have to pay?
- 'Cause you don't got my back.

208
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,364
- These guys got my back.
- You know what, Doug?

209
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:11,428
I will gladly pay. And you know why?
Because that's what grownups do.

210
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,968
They pay for their drinks,
and they don't get into fights.

211
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:16,740
You know what I was doing,
while you were out there being immature?

212
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,741
- I'll tell you what I was doing.
- Your nails?

213
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,707
- I was doing...
- The relationship quiz

214
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:24,872
- in this month's Cosmo?
- No. I was doing...

215
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,314
Your best not to cry
when Big came back for Carrie

216
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,343
at the end
of the <i>Sex and the City</i> movie?

217
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:32,672
Spoilers much? No.
I'll tell you what I was doing...

218
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:35,620
The captain of the football team
because he gave you his promise ring

219
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,929
and you look so pretty in your
open back Homecoming dress?

220
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:42,492
Sorry.

221
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:45,345
I hate those guys!

222
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,483
Acting like they're the manliest guys
in the universe, like they're

223
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,941
Crocodile Dundee
and David Hasselhoff.

224
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,568
Those are the manliest guys
in the universe?

225
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,433
I don't understand why they're getting
all this attention. I mean,

226
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:59,448
- I'm the real hero here.
- Yeah, you are.

227
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,181
I'm serious, woman.
Put it back in your pants.

228
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:07,409
You're the man every boy
should grow up to become

229
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,366
and every girl should marry.

230
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,826
You know what?

231
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,430
I have 2 kids in my class
who won't stop fighting.

232
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:17,191
If you come to school tomorrow
and tell them your story

233
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:21,114
of choosing the path of nonviolence,
it might really set them straight.

234
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,544
And save me having to get up early
to make a lesson plan.

235
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:26,579
All right.

236
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,975
Okay. I'll set them straight.

237
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:30,354
You're a wuss.

238
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,059
What? No!

239
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,772
Mahatma Panda and Martin Luther Koala
are telling you kids

240
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:38,779
- this story to illustrate...
- To illustrate that you're a wuss?

241
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,857
Why didn't you just
fight those guys?

242
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,388
Were you scared?

243
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:44,541
What?

244
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:47,456
I wasn't scared!

245
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,353
- I've been in plenty of fights, okay?
- You're huge!

246
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,881
You must weigh
like a thousand pounds.

247
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,207
First of all,

248
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,273
I'm wearing a baggy sweater,

249
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:01,261
and it has horizontal stripes.

250
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:03,702
And I also...
And I had a salty lunch...

251
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:05,723
And so I'm retain...
You know what? Shut up!

252
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,475
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!

253
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,479
So,

254
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,723
you just beat those guys up?

255
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:19,145
Just?

256
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:23,260
Amanda, were it so simple. You see,

257
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,091
hand to hand combat is about
so much more than just administering

258
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:30,539
- brute force on your opponent, right B?
- You know it!

259
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,909
It's a science.

260
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:34,877
The sweet science, as it were.

261
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,880
Wait, I'm confused,
what did those guys do to deserve it?

262
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,129
This may sound petty,

263
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,393
- but they sat in our booth.
- They sat in our booth.

264
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,082
- And nobody...
- Nobody.

265
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,808
sits in our booth.

266
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,830
Are you going to beat those guys up?

267
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:01,092
We are going to beat those guys up.
Ted, come on.

268
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:06,967
You two. Our booth.

269
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,745
Get out. Now!

270
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,127
- What are you doing?
- Relax, we got Doug.

271
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:13,569
- Big Doug's got our backs.
- Doug's not here tonight.

272
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,346
Can I get you guys anything? Drinks?
Cash? Those two girls over there?

273
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:19,547
Are you Ted Mosby?

274
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,093
- I am.
- And you're Barney Stinson?

275
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,302
They've heard of us.

276
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,777
It's cool, guys.

277
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:29,678
Let you leave
with your asses unkicked.

278
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,253
This time.

279
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:32,809
A'ight?

280
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,231
- What's... What's this?
- You've been served.

281
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,359
You're being sued for assault.

282
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,027
Enjoy your booth.

283
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,518
That was close.

284
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:55,458
Assault!
They're suing us for assault!

285
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:58,712
What's the penalty for assault?
What, do I have to pay a fine?

286
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:02,799
Pick up trash on the highway? 'Cause
I've done that before, know what I mean?

287
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:05,936
- I don't know.
- <i>Actually, he did know</i>

288
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,481
<i>that the worst we were looking at
was a small civil settlement,</i>

289
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,276
<i>and probably no criminal charges.</i>

290
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,043
<i>But he was really pissed at us.</i>

291
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:15,047
I mean, you guys could be looking at
some serious prison time.

292
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,564
- Prison?
- I can't go to prison!

293
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:21,748
I could get a lot of reading done,
finally write some short stories.

294
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:24,532
Work out all the time.
Seriously, if I don't come out

295
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,491
- of there completely ripped...
- Ted, we can't go to prison!

296
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,170
People get shivved in the joint!

297
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,242
Plus the meals are really starchy.

298
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:37,792
You guys should have thought of that
before you beat up those guys.

299
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:41,009
What if we didn't?

300
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:43,241
- Didn't what?
- Didn't beat up those guys.

301
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:46,050
What if Doug beat up those guys all
by himself and we didn't do anything?

302
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,941
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

303
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,264
You guys didn't throw
a single punch.

304
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,802
Well, I hit Ted and myself,

305
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,395
- so...
- Well, who's the wuss now?

306
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,313
Answer: You guys.

307
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,315
Look, can you just help us
get out of this?

308
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,242
You know the old expression:
If you're not prepared to do the time

309
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,846
don't pretend to do the crime
and laugh and get free drinks

310
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:09,410
and not stand up for your friend
who, incidentally,

311
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,201
has been in plenty of fights
with his brothers.

312
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,454
Look, you've got to
help us out, Marshall.

313
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,093
We're the Three Musketeers!

314
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,962
If I give up Ted,
how much time am I looking at?

315
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,177
I've been looking for you.

316
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:33,178
I got tickets to this hockey game
tonight. It's stupid.

317
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:35,874
You want to go?
It might go kind of late,

318
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,186
so, maybe, after the game
we can grab a drink.

319
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,688
Robin, get this.

320
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:41,222
You know that fight?

321
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:43,709
These guys faked the whole thing.

322
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:53,494
Oh, I forgot! Tonight is no good.

323
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,205
I... I can't go to that hockey
game tonight, I got that...

324
00:15:58,695 --> 00:15:59,623
That...

325
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:02,293
That...

326
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:05,660
That...

327
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:09,167
That...

328
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:10,934
That...

329
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,685
Good news... I talked to the guys.

330
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,776
- What guys?
- The guys you didn't beat up.

331
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,828
They agreed to drop the lawsuit.

332
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,734
- Lawyered.
- What? They agreed to drop it?

333
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,737
Yeah, I just explained
that you two are wusses.

334
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,828
We had a good laugh about that.
A good long laugh, actually.

335
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:34,491
I explained how you get
a mani/pedi once a month.

336
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,537
Weekly, Wolverine...
some of us care.

337
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,433
And how you played
the hammer dulcimer

338
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:43,043
in the Pre-Reformation
Dance Society at Wesleyan.

339
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,140
Did you at least tell them
we were one of

340
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,839
the premier Medieval chamber
groups in the Little Ivies?

341
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,154
Oh, I did.

342
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,330
We all agreed it was much more likely
that one guy beat up the three of them

343
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,117
than that you two had
anything to do with it, so...

344
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,268
Wait, so...

345
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:59,933
- So now they're only suing Doug.
- Affirmative.

346
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,075
Angry, irrational,

347
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:04,241
violent Doug,

348
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:07,454
who now knows we were the ones
who threw him under the bus.

349
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,443
They what?

350
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:13,127
- Look, Doug, we can explain...
- Explain what?

351
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:16,575
Explain how you stabbed me
in the back right to my face?

352
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:19,640
- Robin, I'm scared.
- Yeah, is Doug seeing anyone?

353
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,516
Are you seeing anyone?
You really should.

354
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,903
Look, you don't understand,

355
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,960
you beat up those guys
all by yourself.

356
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,165
It's true, all right?
They had nothing to do with it.

357
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,608
Look at these two.

358
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,709
It was all Ted!

359
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,848
- Look at this guy.
- Yeah, look at me!

360
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,311
- He wouldn't last 5 minutes in a fight.
- I think I could last at least five...

361
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,605
He's got the muscle definition
of linguini.

362
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:49,055
Yeah, linguini with meatballs maybe...
Check it.

363
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:52,081
- Look!
- Don't.

364
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,795
Okay, you know what, maybe it was...

365
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:58,034
just me. Actually, that makes a lot
of sense. I tend to black out a lot.

366
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,894
Anyway, look,
I always got your back.

367
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:04,646
All I ask in return is
that you got mine. But you know what?

368
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
You don't.

369
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:08,911
You can't be counted on.

370
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:11,506
No wonder your fiancée left you.

371
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,564
<i>And here it is, kids,
the only fight I've ever been in.</i>

372
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,402
<i>So what can I share
about the experience?</i>

373
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:23,641
<i>Well, for starters, when you
punch someone in the face,</i>

374
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,091
<i>it hurts your hand...</i>

375
00:18:27,161 --> 00:18:28,030
<i>a lot.</i>

376
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,109
<i>But what hurts even more than that?</i>

377
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:34,278
<i>This.</i>

378
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,986
<i>And the next thing
I remember was waking up.</i>

379
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,255
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

380
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:45,494
Turns out getting in a fight
was a terrible idea.

381
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,416
And that's my story.

382
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,460
And what did you learn?

383
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,176
Well, I learned that fighting is bad

384
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,175
and you shouldn't do it ever.

385
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,075
Any questions?

386
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,120
- Where do you find these people?
- I know!

387
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,602
Was there a big sale
at the wuss market?

388
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,871
Wuss! Wuss! Wuss!

389
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:11,530
<i>Of course, I didn't tell those kids
what really happened.</i>

390
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,195
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

391
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,638
What happened?

392
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,977
This happened.

393
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,165
Holy crap!

394
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:28,796
<i>Turns out Uncle Marshall
and his brothers</i>

395
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:30,909
<i>did a little more
than just roughhouse.</i>

396
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:38,384
Cocoa break!

397
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:50,288
Marshall looks good.
Has he lost weight?

398
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:51,724
Bitch, don't even.

399
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,435
<i>Kids, I'd love to leave you
with the message</i>

400
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,421
<i>that fighting is bad
and you shouldn't do it,</i>

401
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,125
<i>but I know that's pointless.</i>

402
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,999
<i>So, I'll leave you with this:</i>

403
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,321
<i>don't ever get in a fight
with Uncle Marshall.</i>

404
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,160
<i>That guy's freaking crazy.</i>

405
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:12,491
It is so good to be home.

406
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,074
Mom, Lily, fantastic job.

407
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,965
"Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat." Right?

408
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,335
Okay, here we go.

409
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:20,803
Goggles on.

410
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,535
All right, so,
you guys pass the plates.

411
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,132
- Lily, you want white or dark meat?
- Dark!

412
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:33,105
Honey, please be careful.
