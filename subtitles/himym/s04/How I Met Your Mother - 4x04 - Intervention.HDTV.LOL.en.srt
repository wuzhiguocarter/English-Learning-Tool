1
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:05,306
Barney is crazy if he thinks
this is gonna work.

2
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:05,222
I think it's
gonna work.

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:06,432
I hope it doesn't work.

4
00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:07,975
Shh. Here he comes.

5
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:14,398
You there, what's your name?
Excuse me?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,567
Your name, woman,
what's your name?!

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,110
Cindy.
I knew it.

8
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:20,154
You're the Cindy,

9
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,448
the one who can change
everything,

10
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,117
or spell our inevitable doom.

11
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,328
Now listen to me, Cindy.

12
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,746
I am Barney Stinson,

13
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:32,041
and I am on an urgent mission
from the future.

14
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,250
The future?

15
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:35,669
The future, and I can
prove it to you.

16
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,921
In exactly four seconds,
the woman at that booth

17
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,715
is going to slap that man.
(clears throat)

18
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,136
Ow! What the hell?

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,929
Wow.
In a few minutes,

20
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,599
the young me from your time

21
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:50,934
is going to come
through that door.

22
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,478
Now, Cindy,

23
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:57,483
I know this sounds insane,
but in order to save the planet,

24
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:00,319
you need to sleep with him
tonight.

25
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:01,445
What? I...

26
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,281
Sleep with Barney Stinson
tonight,

27
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,949
in whatever way he wants it,

28
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:10,120
or he won't be able to find
the solution to global warming

29
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:11,955
that saves the human race.

30
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,165
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:15,250
I have no time to explain.

32
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,670
I have to get back
to the reality accelerator

33
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,839
before the vortex closes.

34
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,133
Only you can save us, Cindy.

35
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,344
I must away!

36
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,222
Okay, guys, the movers
are coming in 14 hours.

37
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:30,891
We gotta get back upstairs
and finish packing.

38
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:32,977
You guys still
aren't finished packing?

39
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:34,353
How is this taking so long?

40
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,188
Hey, all the great memories
of our 20s

41
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,481
took place in that apartment.

42
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,525
It's not like throwing
stuff in a box.

43
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:40,526
You start to reminisce.

44
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,944
Not me. The key?

45
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:43,445
Throw stuff out and never
look back.

46
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:45,906
I'm moving to Japan.
It took me a half hour to pack.

47
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:48,409
A half hour?
Well, it would have taken
me 20 minutes,

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,868
but a friend called me in tears.

49
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,663
Moving is really
emotional, okay?

50
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,706
It is.

51
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,332
I mean, everything is changing.

52
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,376
I'm gonna be living
in New Jersey with Stella,

53
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,211
you guys will be in
your new place.

54
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:01,463
You're starting a new job
in Tokyo.

55
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,632
It's the end of an era.

56
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:06,093
I think we should have a toast,
but not our usual crap.

57
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:09,054
Hey, uh, Wendy,
your most expensive
bottle of scotch.

58
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:13,267
That's 50-year-old
Glen McKenna, and it's $2,500.

59
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,644
Excellent. A bottle of that
with beer chasers,

60
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,479
and what do you think,
cancel the scotch?

61
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:19,440
ALL:
Yeah.

62
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,318
Vodka rocks.

63
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:24,111
It's not gonna work.

64
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:27,448
Oh, my God, you're...
Oh, my God!

65
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,616
Can I buy you a drink?

66
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,829
I suppose I have time
for one drink

67
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:37,583
and 45 minutes to an hour
of some other activity,

68
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,460
but after that,
I have to get back

69
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:42,254
to a top-secret research project
I'm working on.

70
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:44,173
Global warming?

71
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:47,801
My God, how did you know that?

72
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:50,102
Sync By GeR - http://gerdiffuse.free.fr

73
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,525
Hey, look at this.

74
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:06,195
A photo from the first day
we moved into this place.

75
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:07,988
BOTH:
Aw...

76
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,115
So many great memories.

77
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,118
See? That is exactly the type
of crap you should be trashing.

78
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,246
So you don't keep
any photos?

79
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:19,291
No, they're like love letters
or yearbooks or someone's ashes.

80
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,918
They just take up space.

81
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,796
Besides, Stella's not gonna
let you keep half of this junk.

82
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,797
Why wouldn't she?

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,632
(both chuckle)

84
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,801
Oh, Ted, oh, sweetie.

85
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,427
Okay, here's the thing
that guys only learn

86
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,304
after they move in
with a woman.

87
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,390
All of your stuff is stupid.

88
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:35,849
Like what?

89
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,561
Um, like anything you bought
at a Renaissance Faire.

90
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:42,147
Hey, hey, there's not enough
mead in the world

91
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,983
to make me get rid
of my flail.

92
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,651
Oh, hey, uh, Ted,

93
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,695
since we're clearly not getting
our security deposit back,

94
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:49,989
I thought maybe you could
reimburse me for my half.

95
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:51,031
Wait a second--
why should I

96
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:52,491
have to pay more than you?

97
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:54,994
Because you treated this
apartment the way John Bonham

98
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:56,996
treated his central nervous
system.

99
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,664
That's not true.

100
00:03:58,747 --> 00:04:00,708
Exhibit A.

101
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:03,919
Hey.
Hey.

102
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:04,920
What's that?

103
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:08,173
A 1986 World Book
encyclopaedia.

104
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,009
It's exactly the one
I grew up with.

105
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,510
Encyclopaedia?

106
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:14,555
Oh, you think it should
be pronounced encyclo-pee-dia.

107
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,016
It's a common mistake.

108
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,726
But if you look at that squished
together "ae" symbol

109
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,561
in this here encyclopaedia,

110
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:22,855
you'll learn that
it's a ligature derived

111
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:25,482
from the Anglo-Saxon
rune ash...

112
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,824
You know, you're gonna have
to paedia for that.

113
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,286
But you never did.

114
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,455
And then there's Exhibit B.

115
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,419
Good morrow, fair gentles.

116
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,880
Look what I won
at the Renaissance Faire.

117
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:52,092
Ooh!

118
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,678
And you're also responsible
for any damage Robin did

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,804
when she was your girlfriend.

120
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,765
Whoa. What damage did I cause?

121
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:59,975
Do you remember that night
when you drank

122
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:02,311
the 12'er of Molson
and you got all super Canadian?

123
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,733
(Canadian accent):
Stanley Cup, game six, eh?

124
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,568
The Rangers are

125
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,279
about to be sorry they ever
played shinny with the Canucks.

126
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:13,614
Hey, hey, Robin.
Yeah?

127
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:14,740
I'll give you 20 bucks if you

128
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:16,408
can shoot it through
this front door.

129
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,245
Oh, you're nuttier than
a Tim Horton's maple log.

130
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,289
Timmy Ho!

131
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:26,919
That's it, Robin.
Give me the stick.

132
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,545
I'll give you summer teeth.

133
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,714
Some are here, some are there.

134
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:33,133
Robin, give me the stick,

135
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,927
Take off, hoser.

136
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,011
GUYS:
Whoa!

137
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,012
That's it!

138
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,013
Hey, hey!

139
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,014
Get her, boys, get her!

140
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,015
Scrap?! I'll scrap!

141
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,642
Guys, come on!
For America.

142
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:45,437
All right, break it,
break it up!

143
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,523
Ted, no!

144
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:50,025
You never break up a girl fight!

145
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:53,487
Never! (groans)

146
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,448
Entirely Barney's fault.

147
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,745
As, by the way, is the big
scorch mark over the fireplace.

148
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,915
<i>NARRATOR:
Kids, to understand
the story of the scorch mark,</i>

149
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:07,459
<i>I first need to tell you
the story of the intervention</i>

150
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:08,544
<i>for our friend Stewart.</i>

151
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:09,545
What's going on?

152
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:13,507
Stewart, this is
an intervention.

153
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:16,760
The alcohol changes
you, Stewart.

154
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,263
It makes you a
different person.

155
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,391
And I'm in love with
the man that I married.

156
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:24,810
Thank you.

157
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:28,564
(voice breaking):
This is just the push I need.

158
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:31,066
I love you guys.

159
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,821
Hey, hey!
There's the birthday boy.

160
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,657
Time to let the party monster
out of its cage, Stewie!

161
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:39,992
No!

162
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:41,493
Come on, buddy.

163
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,996
People don't want to see
Bruce Banner, dude.

164
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,581
They want to see the Hulk.

165
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:49,043
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk... What?

166
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:52,046
Oh...

167
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,633
(chuckles)

168
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,968
That's what I get for skimming
the E-vite.

169
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:02,097
<i>TED:
Later that day, we celebrated</i>

170
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,390
<i>our first successful

171
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:06,435
I am really proud of us
for helping Stewart.

172
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:09,396
Yeah, what an amazing
honest, human moment.

173
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,523
I agree. Yay us.

174
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,652
Marshall, are you really gonna
keep wearing that hat?

175
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,236
Yeah, it's been two weeks,
Marshall.

176
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,906
Two awesome weeks...

177
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:22,618
and heck, yeah,
I'm gonna keep wearing it.

178
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,041
Hey.

179
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:31,418
Marshall,

180
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,545
this is
an intervention.

181
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,465
It's about the hat.

182
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:39,218
Huh? No...

183
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,178
I have it under control, okay?

184
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,014
I can take it off
whenever I want to.

185
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,100
Dear Marshall,

186
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:49,395
I do not like
that stupid hat.

187
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,064
I want to beat it
with a bat.

188
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:54,817
Or maybe stab it
with a fork.

189
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:57,152
It makes you look
like such a dork.

190
00:07:57,236 --> 00:08:00,030
<i>TED:
After that,
interventions became</i>

191
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:01,949
<i>a pretty regular thing
around our apartment.</i>

192
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:03,534
Shh.

193
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:07,746
(English accent):
Cor blimey.

194
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,289
This is a nice bloody surprise.

195
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:10,958
What's this about then?

196
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,584
Lily...

197
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,255
it's about the weird
fake English accent.

198
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:18,048
Oh, bollocks.

199
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,468
Oh... (clears throat)

200
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:25,889
Spray tan?

201
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,393
(sobbing):
They reel you in with a coupon,

202
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,312
and then you just get hooked.

203
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:33,981
Oh, we know, sweetie, we know.

204
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:36,650
No, no, no, no--
this is a new sweater.

205
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,321
What?

206
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:41,697
The magic tricks.

207
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,116
Specifically, those
involving fire.

208
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:46,493
Magic tricks?

209
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,246
Guys, interventions are
supposed to help people,

210
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,041
not attack every little thing
you don't like about them.

211
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,711
I'm sorry, but that
really steams me.

212
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,546
That really burns me up!

213
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:02,593
I mean, I am filled
with a white-hot rage!

214
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,678
(growling)

215
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:08,974
(all scream)

216
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,517
Thank you.

217
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:13,187
Oh, shoot.

218
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,980
I smell hair!
I smell hair!

219
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:16,815
<i>TED:
And that's the story
of the scorch mark.</i>

220
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,150
Wait, that's weird.

221
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,568
When I was going
through the closet,

222
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,737
I thought I saw
the intervention banner.

223
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:23,989
S-So?

224
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,575
So, the banner burned up.
Why is there a new one?

225
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,120
And there are sealed letters
here from all of you

226
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:31,413
that say "Ted."

227
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,749
Were you guys planning
an intervention for me?

228
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,251
Oh, that--
that was stupid.

229
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,045
Yeah, just, just forget
about that.

230
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,797
Wh-What was it for?
The Crocs?

231
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,841
The hair product?
Not Stella.

232
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,178
Oh, my God,
this was about Stella.

233
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,556
I just said "Not Stella."

234
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,643
So maybe it was about
your poor listening skills, Ted.

235
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,311
What?
It's out of control. See?

236
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,627
Ted, we do.

237
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:07,212
We're all really happy
for you.

238
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,464
Yeah. Like I said,
it was stupid.

239
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:11,383
Well, obviously, it wasn't,
because we agreed

240
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,260
not to have any more
stupid interventions

241
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:14,511
at our intervention
intervention.

242
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:19,308
We're having
too many interventions.

243
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:23,645
So, what was your big, serious
oblem with me and Stella?

244
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:24,813
Yes!

245
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:27,149
Yes! In everyone's face!

246
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,525
You all said

247
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:29,943
the "future Barney" thing
wouldn't work.

248
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:31,486
<i>You told me I was crazy.</i>

249
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,072
<i>My shrink told me I was crazy.</i>

250
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:35,657
Well, who's the narcissist

251
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:38,702
with severe attachment disorder
now, Dr. Grossbard?!

252
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:42,623
Intervention banner?
What's that for?

253
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:45,792
Stella.
Ah.

254
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:49,171
"Ted, I cannot stand idly by..."

255
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:50,714
You've just been
carrying that around?

256
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:51,840
Please, Ted?

257
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,344
"I cannot stand idly by
while you make

258
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:58,472
"the biggest mistake any man
can make-- getting married.

259
00:10:58,513 --> 00:10:59,848
"Mark my words,

260
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:02,017
"this whole thing is gonna go

261
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:03,727
up in flames!"

262
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:06,647
Oh, damn!

263
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,857
I put the flame cue too early.

264
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,401
I had so many more
important things to say, and...

265
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,445
The point is, Ted,

266
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:16,698
marriage is stupid.

267
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,117
Every year, there are

268
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,870
a million new hot 22-year-olds

269
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:24,957
walking into bars,
and call me "glass half full,"

270
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,042
but I think
they're getting dumber.

271
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:30,087
Oh, come on, Barney,
even you aren't still gonna be

272
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,005
hitting on 22-year-olds
when you're 80.

273
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,676
I accept that challenge.
What challenge?

274
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:39,555
To prove to you that
I will be exactly this awesome

275
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:43,892
when I'm 80, I will hook up
with a 22-year-old

276
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:45,894
while in my old-man makeup.

277
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:48,313
I didn't remotely
challenge you to that.

278
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:50,899
I mean, I definitely
want to see it.

279
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,277
But I didn't remotely
challenge you to that.

280
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:55,362
I want to hear
the other letters.

281
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:57,239
Ted, this is ridiculous.

282
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:58,907
W-We changed our minds.

283
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,242
And suppose
you change them back?

284
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:02,119
Lily, come on,
let's hear yours.

285
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,246
(sighs)

286
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:10,085
"Gilbert's reading skills have
improved drastically since..."

287
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:13,130
Wait, this is a letter
I meant to send home

288
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,299
with one of
my kindergarteners.

289
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:16,550
Uh-oh.

290
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:18,927
Gilbert,
are things moving too fast

291
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:21,013
between you and a girl
named Stella?

292
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:23,223
I wish.

293
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,478
Robin, could I hear yours?

294
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,359
(sighs)

295
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:35,485
"Dear Ted,
it's 'encyclo-pee-dia,'

296
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,071
not 'encyclo-pay-dia.'

297
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:39,281
"Why do you always
say things

298
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,408
"in the most pretentious
way possible?

299
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,577
"It makes you sound douchey--

300
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:46,246
and that's 'douchey,'
not 'douch-ay.'"

301
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:47,748
Yeah, you already read that one

302
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,082
at my pronunciation
intervention.

303
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:51,293
Where's the letter
about Stella?

304
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:53,045
I didn't write one--
I-I'm your ex-girlfriend;

305
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:56,048
I figured anything I said on
the subject would sound catty.

306
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,675
Plus, I'm hotter than her,

307
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:00,844
so who cares?

308
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,512
Marshall?

309
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,182
Dude, it's water
under the bridge...
Please.

310
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,476
(sighs)

311
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:16,652
"Dear Ted, Stella seems
like a wonderful person.

312
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:21,156
"But you don't know her
well enough to get married.

313
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,616
"You certainly

314
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:24,034
"don't know her well enough

315
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,329
"to commit to raising
a seven-year-old with her.

00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:30,457
"You're not
"doing her, her child

317
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,627
"or yourself any favors
by rushing into this.

318
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,838
Just give it some more time."

319
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:40,008
Dude, that was months
ago, all right?

320
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,052
That was before we
got to know Stella

321
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:45,889
and see how awesome
she is and what a great
couple you guys are.

322
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:48,517
That's why we decided not
to even have that intervention.

323
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,519
Thank you.
Because I-I really need you guys

324
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:52,104
to be on board with this.

325
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,856
And we are.
And we hope you're
not mad at us.

326
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,275
Course not.

327
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:59,236
I mean, it's not like
what you said was crazy.

328
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,822
Y-You had a lot
of valid concerns.
Yeah,

329
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:04,491
but concerns we have
completely moved on from.

330
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,034
But you had a point.

331
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:09,329
I mean, this whole thing
has moved pretty fast.

332
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,623
Well, you know what?
Maybe that's because, uh,

333
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,333
when it's right,
yojust know.

334
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,335
Yeah, I guess,
but-but we are still,

335
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,170
you know, getting
to know each other.

336
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:19,047
And, Lily, maybe
you're right.

337
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,092
Maybe Stella won't like
any of my stuff.

338
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,845
Like the robot cookie jar.

339
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:26,513
This was, like,
the first thing

340
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:28,348
we bought for this place,
remember?

341
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,058
Of course I do.

342
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:32,561
(robot voice):
Marshall, my sensors indicate

343
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:36,690
that your pecan sandy levels
are dangerously low.

344
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:40,277
Ah. My collection
of James Bond movies.

345
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,321
Remember? We watched
them all in order,

346
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:44,907
and then Lily spoke
in that weird English accent

347
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,241
for, like, the next month?

348
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,868
It was sophisticated.
No.

349
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:49,077
Nope.
No.

350
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:52,372
Oh!
My signed Bernie Kosar cleats.

351
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,917
My elephant lamp.

352
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,376
The English phone booth.

353
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:57,920
My sombrero!

354
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:59,254
(laughs)

355
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:01,882
Ted, what are you doing?

356
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:03,300
Unpacking.

357
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:15,157
No, no, Ted,
stop unpacking.

358
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,659
You're just freaking out.

359
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,452
I'm not ready for all
the responsibility.

360
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:20,746
<i>And-And I'm certainly
not ready to be a step-dad</i>

361
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:22,122
<i>to a seven-year-old.</i>

362
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:25,167
I mean, if I get married
and move to the suburbs,

363
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,544
in the blink of an eye,
I've become an old man!

364
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:32,007
Why, hello, young lady.

365
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,761
You want a butterscotch candy?

366
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:37,930
What do you mean,
"nothing in common"?

367
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:39,682
We're both seniors.

368
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,352
(cackling)
(laughs)

369
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:44,812
You're cute.

370
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:46,313
How old are you?

371
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:49,608
83. How old are you?

372
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,609
Thirty-one.

373
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,320
(groans):
Oh-oh...

374
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:54,822
Okay,

375
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:56,115
Ted has officially snapped.

376
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,492
There are moving men
coming in ten hours.

377
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:01,120
His fianc閑 is waiting for him
in New Jersey.

378
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:02,621
We have to do something.

379
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,540
I got this.

380
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,460
Hey, bud?

381
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:09,753
Hey.

382
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,714
Why don't you come
here for a minute.

383
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,132
What?

384
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:16,343
Look, I want you to know
this is all totally normal.

385
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:19,722
Big transitions can be
scary, and cold feet--

386
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,807
well, they're just
part of the deal.

387
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:25,519
So... how about you
give me the knife?

388
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:28,188
Give me the knife.

389
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:29,356
Come on.

390
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,485
So I can start unpacking, too.

391
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,821
I'm staying here right by
your side forever, buddy!

392
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:37,072
Yeah!
Yeah!

393
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:38,532
Marshall!
Lily,

394
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:40,659
our lives have
been good here.

395
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,995
That's why we've been
putting off packing.

396
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,247
Because subconsciously,
we both know that

397
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:46,582
it would be stupid to leave.

398
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,542
It's safe and warm here.

399
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,668
There's a bar downstairs,

400
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,170
and a cookie robot
in the kitchen.

401
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:53,172
This is my home,
and I'm never leaving!

402
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,465
Listen to you!

403
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,967
You sound like that
fat, dweeby kid at camp.

404
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:58,969
"Mom, Dad, I want to come home.

405
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,764
The cool kids are playing
keep-away with my inhaler."

406
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:03,849
I can't believe
my dad read that letter

407
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,392
at our wedding.
Marshall, you can't

408
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:06,852
do this to Lily.

409
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:08,395
Yes, I know your new place
has had some problems,

410
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,606
with the slanted floors
and the nearby

411
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:11,940
sewage treatment plant,

412
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:13,859
but you're gonna
turn it into a great home.

413
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,569
Tell him, Lily.

414
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:18,113
It's a black hole
where dreams go to die.

415
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:19,406
I'm not moving, either.

416
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:21,659
Oh, come on!
Yes!

417
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:22,910
Okay, you guys finish unpacking.

418
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:24,411
I'm gonna go
bake some cookies

419
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:26,747
to fill
R2-Sweet Tooth.

420
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:29,166
Oh, my God, look at you cowards!

421
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,502
So afraid of any kind of change.

422
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:33,879
So terrified of anything new.

423
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,381
So-so desperate to cling

424
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,216
to anything
comfortable and familiar.

425
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,051
I can't move to Japan.

426
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:41,303
Yes!
Whoa!

427
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:42,304
What was I thinking?

428
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:43,764
It's so far away.

429
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,224
And I don't speak the language.

430
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,558
(crying):
I didn't even have

431
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:49,687
any good pictures of you guys.
Oh, sweetie.

432
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,813
Everybody says

433
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,147
change is so great, right?

434
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,857
But what's so great
about change?

435
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:56,026
Hey, who wants
to walk down to our

436
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,945
same old bar,
sit in our regular booth

437
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,196
and order the usual?!

438
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,324
Yeah!
The usual!
My favorite!

439
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,912
Oh, my God.

440
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,414
(disgusted groan)

441
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,794
Well, well, well.

442
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:14,962
I believe

443
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:18,132
someone owes me $200.

444
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:20,718
Barney, this was
never a bet-- nobody...

445
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:24,471
This proves that I will be
this awesome when I'm 80.

446
00:18:24,513 --> 00:18:26,515
Arthritis five.

447
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,978
I'm moving to New Jersey.

448
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,604
What?
And you and
Marshall

449
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,607
should move to your new place,
and Robin should go to Japan.

450
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:36,650
Why?

451
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:37,776
Because we're gonna get older

452
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,069
whether we like it or not,

453
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:40,654
so the only
question is

454
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:43,282
whether we want
to get on with our lives

455
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:46,452
or desperately cling to the past
and end up like that.

456
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,162
You mean awesome?

457
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:50,622
I'm 80, dude,

458
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:53,250
and I'm making out
with a 22-year-old.

459
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:56,587
<i>(French accent):
Take me to your
place, cheri.</i>

460
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,256
I want to see your
World War II medals.

461
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,759
<i>(chuckles):
In a minute, mon petite.</i>

462
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,927
All right, so that
doesn't count.

463
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,429
What? Why?

464
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,513
She's French--
that's like

465
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:08,015
playing tennis
with the net down.

466
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:10,517
You know what?

467
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,102
I'll cover the security deposit.

468
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:13,687
I'm glad to, because...

469
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:15,439
every dent in that place

470
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,650
represents a memory
that I'll cherish forever.

471
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,193
But on one condition:

472
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:22,613
we all put aside ten bucks
every week for the next year,

473
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,991
and we come back here and we
buy that 50-year-old scotch,

474
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:27,951
and we toast
the incredible

475
00:19:27,993 --> 00:19:29,953
life-changing year
we've all had.

476
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:32,498
(quietly):
Get out of our booth.

477
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,210
Me with my new family,

478
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:39,046
Marshall and Lily in their
new apartment, and Robin

479
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:41,256
as the number one
English-speaking journalist

480
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,549
in the Pacific Rim,

481
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,842
visiting us

482
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:46,387
here in New York
to celebrate this day--

483
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,097
the day we closed

484
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,682
an incredible chapter
in our lives,

485
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,517
only to open up a new one.

486
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:52,643
Mm.

487
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:53,978
Um, I think I
left my cell...

488
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,270
Get out of here.

489
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:00,734
<i>NARRATOR:
And one year later,
that's exactly what we did.</i>

490
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:02,653
And so let's raise a glass

491
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,656
of $2,500 scotch
to one hell of a year.

492
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,408
Mm.

493
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,911
Amazing.
Mm-mm!

494
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:12,663
That's unbelievable.

495
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,582
It's kind of smoky,
with a hint of aged cedar and...

496
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,168
Do you guys taste the difference
and ten-dollar scotch?

497
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:19,336
Not at all.
No difference.

498
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,629
I want to cut mine
with Red Bull.

499
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:23,841
Oh, Wendy, can you
take a picture?

500
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:26,218
<i>NARRATOR:
A lot of things
did change that year,</i>

501
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:28,762
<i>but some things
stayed the same.</i>

502
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:30,431
So, uh, what do you say

503
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:32,641
we move this party
upstairs to the apartment?

504
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,226
Yeah.
Great idea.

505
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,145
I got the scotch.

506
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,217
What the...?

507
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:48,513
Barney, this is
an intervention.

508
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:51,933
(old man voice):
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

509
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:54,185
Enough with
the "old man" bit.

510
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:57,021
What about the old sand pit?

511
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,648
Let it go.

512
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,150
"Let It Snow"?

513
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,110
I love that old ditty!

514
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:05,905
I'm getting my flail.

515
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,116
You're setting sail?
