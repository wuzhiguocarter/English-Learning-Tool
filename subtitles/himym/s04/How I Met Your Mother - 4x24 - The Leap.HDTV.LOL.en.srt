1
00:00:00,759 --> 00:00:04,423
<i>Every architect can point to that one
design that changed their career.</i>

2
00:00:04,548 --> 00:00:07,413
<i>For me, it was around the time
of my 31st birthday.</i>

3
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:11,535
It wasn't a museum or a concert hall
or a skyscraper.

4
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:13,387
<i>It was something else.</i>

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,099
We're opening a restaurant called
Rib Town, and we want it to be shaped...

6
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,229
Like a cowboy hat.

7
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:23,939
Look, I need the work.
I don't have any other options.

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,108
- There's always that teaching job.
- Yeah,

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,728
I didn't work this hard to be stuck
in some crappy, dead-end teaching job.

10
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:32,868
- No offense, Lily.
- I got peed on three times today.

11
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,367
No arguments here.

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,862
I just gotta nail this hat building so,
I'll see you all in three days.

13
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>For the next three days, I worked harder
than I'd ever worked in my life.</i>

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,088
<i>And I got... nowhere.</i>

15
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,604
Hey, Ted, whatcha doing?

16
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,762
Designing a building shaped
like a hat.

17
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:56,889
- Now a good time to chat?
- No.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,822
- So, what do you think of Robin?
- I really need to get to work, so...

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,070
Great.
Say you and I went suit-shopping,

20
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:07,135
and you happened upon
a beautiful suit,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,360
a beautiful Canadian suit.

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,871
Double-breasted.

23
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,445
You try it on, but it's not exactly
the right fit for you.

24
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,995
So, you put it back.
Then I try it on.

25
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:21,343
I don't really want

26
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,958
to take the same suit that you had
your eye on, but at the same time,

27
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,357
I really like that suit.

28
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,872
Buy the suit, Barney.
You clearly care about it.

29
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:33,676
Tell the suit how you feel.

30
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,932
But Ted, rember that
that was your answer because...

31
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,212
The suit is Robin.

32
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:46,886
I know!

33
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:48,996
Right?

34
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,235
I'm with you, buddy.

35
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:52,611
You are now.

36
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:56,407
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...

37
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,026
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

38
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,455
Come on, dude, you've been at this
for three days without a break.

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,003
It's your birthday. Come up to the roof
and have a beer with me.

40
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,887
No can do.
Presentation is tomorrow.

41
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:20,723
Hat buildings
don't design themselves.

42
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,263
It's a rib joint for fat tourists.

43
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:25,820
Just make sure the doors are wide
and the chairs are reinforced.

44
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,814
Now, birthday beer on the roof.
Let's go!

45
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,997
Why do you want me to come up
to the roof so bad?

46
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:33,773
{\pos(192,210)}- Are you throwing me a surprise party?
- What?

47
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:37,124
{\pos(192,210)}Ted, we threw you
a surprise party last year.

48
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,658
{\pos(192,220)}Okay, you don't get
two surprise parties in a row.

49
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,876
{\pos(192,220)}The fact that anyone showed up
at the first one was surprise enough.

50
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,581
{\pos(192,220)}Right?
Two surprise parties in a row!

51
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,044
{\pos(192,210)}That is rich!

52
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,313
{\pos(192,210)}That is rich!

53
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,562
{\pos(192,210)}Classic!

54
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:54,287
{\pos(192,190)}Classic...
He still won't come up.

55
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,259
{\pos(192,190)}Come on. What the crap?!

56
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,012
{\pos(192,210)}I knew having a second surprise party
was a bad idea.

57
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,890
{\pos(192,210)}Yes, Robin, I know.
This party is...

58
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:05,156
{\pos(192,210)}it's... it's a disaster.

59
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,389
{\pos(192,210)}It was my idea.
I take responsibility.

60
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:12,691
{\pos(192,210)}And there's really only one thing
to do about it.

61
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,033
- Marshall, no.
- Lily, I have to do this!

62
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,202
No point in putting it off
any longer.

63
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,664
<i>I should explain.
You see, a few years earlier...</i>

64
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:32,545
Forget it.
This is so not pimped out.

65
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,597
If anything, this is pimped in.

66
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:39,707
{\pos(192,210)}You know who knows how to live?
Those people.

67
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:42,888
{\pos(192,210)}<i>The rooftop patio
one building over from ours.</i>

68
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,838
{\pos(192,210)}<i>Across a chasm of just six or seven feet
awaited a landscaped paradise.</i>

69
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,108
{\pos(192,210)}<i>And best of all...</i>

70
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,956
{\pos(192,210)}That looks to be one...

71
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:52,648
{\pos(192,210)}... hot...

72
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:54,400
{\pos(192,210)}tub.

73
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:56,347
{\pos(192,210)}Great. How do we get over there?

74
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,904
{\pos(192,210)}What are we gonna do? Jump?

75
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,093
I can jump that far.

76
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,988
{\pos(192,180)}Marshall, lately it takes you
two tries to get off the sofa.

77
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:16,813
You can't jump that far.

78
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:20,009
- Really?
- Really.

79
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:21,705
Watch me.

80
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:30,973
<i>But he didn't jump.</i>

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,549
This actually is kind of nice.

82
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,385
Right? Right?

83
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:43,342
<i>And in the years that followed,
he kept almost jumping.</i>

84
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,195
<i>But each time, without fail...</i>

85
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:55,291
Here we go.

86
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,712
<i>He didn't jump.</i>

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,257
But don't worry.
'Cause if I can make this jump tonight,

88
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,885
it's totally gonna save the party.

89
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,262
Honey, please get down from there.

90
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:09,689
When Evel Knievel sat astride
his star-spangled rocket

91
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:11,853
on the rim of Snake River Canyon,

92
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,022
do you think his wife said,
"Honey, get down from there"?

93
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:18,468
For the last time,
I am not Linda Knievel!

94
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:21,153
I will never be Linda Knievel!

95
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,948
You don't need to remind me.

96
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,148
Marshall, please don't do this.
Please don't jump.

97
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:39,296
I'm sorry, Lily,
but I gotta do this.

98
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,173
- You can't do this.
- Why?

99
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,474
You want a reason?

100
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,577
I'll give you a reason.

101
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:47,150
I'm pregnant.

102
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:49,181
Oh, my God!

103
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,267
Oh, my God, really?!

104
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:54,645
Lily, I mean, I noticed
that you gained some weight lately...

105
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,523
I was lying, you jerk!

106
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,859
Go ahead and jump.
I hope you die!

107
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,527
That's all the permission I need.

108
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,955
Listen, Robin...

109
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,970
- There's something I have to tell you.
- But wait.

110
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:22,673
Before you do,
I have to tell you something first.

111
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:25,654
What is it?

112
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:28,513
I think I'm in love with you.

113
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,414
It's Ted.
Everybody!

114
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:46,238
- Hey, Ted, what's up?
- It's here, Lily.

115
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,420
It's looking at me.

116
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:52,703
- What is?
- The goat.

117
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,914
<i>Now, I've told you some of the story
of the goat already.</i>

118
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:59,496
<i>How Aunt Lily invited a local farmer
to come talk to her class,</i>

119
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:00,998
<i>and how he brought a goat,</i>

120
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:03,155
<i>and how he told the whole class
what he was gonna do</i>

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,907
<i>to the goat later that day.</i>

122
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,009
<i>And how Aunt Lily,
in a fit of mercy,</i>

123
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,262
<i>bought the goat off the guy
in order to commute its sentence.</i>

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,598
Something amazing has happened.

125
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,820
I was talking to Robin,
I was all set to tell her how I feel,

126
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,729
but before I could,
you'll never believe what she said.

127
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,522
I think I'm in love with you.

128
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,233
- What did you say?!
- What do you think I said?

129
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,361
What would anyone say
to something like that?

130
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,659
Robin, listen.

131
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:31,784
You're great.

132
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,713
I mean, you're really awesome,
but I mean, we're friends.

133
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,581
It's probably a bad idea.

134
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,666
I guess you're right.

135
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,462
Have a good party.

136
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,958
You too, kiddo.

137
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,769
- What?!
- It's like, as soon as she said that,

138
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:52,179
no more feelings.
I'm not in love with her anymore.

139
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,751
So, you've been in love with this girl
for the past year,

140
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,747
and the second
she reciprocates those feelings,

141
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,479
just like that, you're over her.

142
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,439
How great is that?!

143
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:11,532
This is a washcloth.

144
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Not food.

145
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:31,885
What the...?

146
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:35,613
This is it.

147
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,066
Here...

148
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,086
we... go!

149
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:43,230
This is it.

150
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:46,400
Tracey, Tracey,
tell Lily what you just told me.

151
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:50,233
- That I just moved to New York?
- No, no, but tell her how you got here.

152
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,203
I just got off the bus from Iowa.

153
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:55,444
I just got off the bus from Iowa!

154
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:59,293
How lucky is it that an aspiring

155
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:00,418
dancer

156
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:03,740
just off the bus from Iowa runs into

157
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,911
the producer of the Rockettes?

158
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:09,506
I feel like I'm in one of those
classic show biz stories.

159
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,593
Honey, you are.
You really are.

160
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,742
Tracey, why don't you make me
one of those rum and beers

161
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,764
- that your dad loves so much?
- Sure thing!

162
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:22,311
- Damn it.
- What?

163
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:25,934
Everybody always says,
"Don't tell Lily."

164
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,917
"Lily can't keep a secret."
And, usually, they're right.

165
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:31,153
But this time, I kept the secret.

166
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:33,886
And then you come along
with this crap

167
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:38,008
and you force me to pull
an old classic Lily and spill the beans!

168
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,662
What beans?
There's beans?

169
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:42,956
There's beans.

170
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,959
The suit is Robin.

171
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,510
I know!

172
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,629
Right?

173
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:50,881
I'm with you, buddy.

174
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:52,257
You are now.

175
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:55,719
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...

176
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:58,782
There you go.

177
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,230
Crap.

178
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,800
- He said that?
- Oh, my God!

179
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,735
What a tremendous
ground-breaking surprise!

180
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,519
- How long have you known?
- 8 months.

181
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:16,240
And you've kept it a secret since then?
Good for you.

182
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,053
Good for you, Lily.

183
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,703
I mean, what a bombshell.
Who saw that coming?

184
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,110
- How long have you known?
- Seven months, 29 days.

185
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,165
God, what am I going to do?

186
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,329
I don't know.

187
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:29,044
What are you going to do?

188
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:31,922
I'm going to marry Barney
in a big church wedding.

189
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,468
We're going to move
to some sleepy New Hampshire town

190
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,926
and open a bed-and-breakfast.

191
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,682
- Really?
- No!

192
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,347
It's Barney.

193
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,559
I mean...

194
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,387
it's Barney.

195
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,676
But it's Barney.

196
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,479
I got to tell him no.

197
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:50,374
Oh, man, you're going
to break his...

198
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:54,570
Whatever it is that pumps
that black sludge through his veins.

199
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:56,280
Crap. You're right.

200
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,959
The first time Barney
expresses feelings for a girl

201
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,501
and she rejects him?

202
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,075
And not just any girl. I mean...

203
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:05,846
It will destroy him.

204
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,230
Okay, well, first of all...

205
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,131
Second of all,
there is a maneuver you can try.

206
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,380
It's high-risk,
but it's also high-reward.

207
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:21,058
For lack of a better term,
I'm going to call it...

208
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:24,308
- The Mosby.
- The Mosby?

209
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,366
No, she couldn't Mosby him.

210
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,646
- She could Mosby the crap out of him.
- What's the Mosby?

211
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:31,886
Robin, you remember
your first date with Ted?

212
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,126
You wanted to hop on the T-train
and take a ride downtown.

213
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:36,903
I was ready to jump that turnstile.

214
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:39,698
What changed all that?

215
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,449
I think I'm in love with you.

216
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,368
What?

217
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,288
The Mosby!

218
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,103
- That is genius.
- Thank you.

219
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:49,958
And...

220
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:51,686
excuse me.

221
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:56,365
I mean, you're very pretty,
but you're freakishly tall,

222
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,037
and you don't believe in ghosts.

223
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:02,453
So, when she said she thinks
she's in love with me,

224
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:04,681
she meant the opposite.

225
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,767
Exactly.

226
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,018
And look how well it worked.
You're back to normal.

227
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,853
Yes. Yes, I am.

228
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:12,709
And it is great.
It's awesome.

229
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,958
- So, Robin's not in love with me.
- Nope.

230
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,906
Why not?

231
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:24,326
Mr. Goat?

232
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:40,842
Mr. Goat?

233
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:45,414
That's it.

234
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,393
Stupid goat.

235
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:53,855
I do not understand your
fascination with this washcloth.

236
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,650
I guess that's what happens
when you have a brain the size of a...

237
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:06,660
Marshall, can you just go get Ted?

238
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:10,156
Lily, I was just about to jump.

239
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:13,094
Didn't you hear me saying "Okay"
over and over again?

240
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,127
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go ahead and jump.

241
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,234
No, it's fine.

242
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,820
Sorry, everybody.

243
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,121
Lily won't let me jump.

244
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:27,535
Thank God.

245
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,900
Hospital!

246
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,462
What happened exactly?

247
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:47,102
What happened is
you let a freaking wild animal

248
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,677
into our apartment.

249
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,428
I was savaged.

250
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,666
That is the sweetest, cutest
little goat in the whole world.

251
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,287
Sweetest, cutest little goat
in the whole world?

252
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,419
<i>I was pretty sleep-deprived
at this point,</i>

253
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:02,406
<i>so this probably isn't
how it really happened,</i>

254
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:03,842
<i>but here's how I rember it.</i>

255
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:24,905
So, you're the guy who tried
to make it with a goat?

256
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,158
If anything, that goat
tried to make it with me.

257
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,037
- Can I go, please?
- Sure, you can go.

258
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,082
But remember, buddy,
"baa" means "baa."

259
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,254
Great. Great. Now I'm going to be late
for my presentation.

260
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,507
Thanks a lot, Mr. Goat.

261
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,051
Mr. Goat? Ted, that goat's a girl.

262
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,057
- Her name's Missy.
- You got beat up by a girl.

263
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:58,021
So.

264
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,608
- You're in love with me.
- What? Yeah. Very much.

265
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,870
Okay, you can knock it off.
Lily told me.

266
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:05,946
Damn it.

267
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:08,240
I can't believe you would do that.

268
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:10,147
It's just...

269
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:11,910
Like, I care about you, Barney.

270
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,953
And...

271
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,523
This kind of stuff,
the emotional stuff?

272
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,792
It's not your thing.
I thought I'd save you the trouble.

273
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:20,919
Maybe I don't want
to be saved the trouble.

274
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,796
Maybe I want the trouble.

275
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,065
I haven't wanted the trouble
in a long time.

276
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,723
But with you, the trouble
doesn't seem so...

277
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:30,563
troubling.

278
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:33,515
I don't know.
I thought...

279
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:36,518
I guess I thought
you felt the same way.

280
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,062
Maybe I do.

281
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,980
I don't know.

282
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:44,929
I'm not exactly the biggest
confronter of feelings.

283
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:49,022
I mean, clearly, there's
something between us.

284
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,309
Maybe my head was saying,
"Nip it in the bud"

285
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,030
because my heart was...

286
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,050
saying something else.

287
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,858
Look...

288
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,251
I have feelings for you, Barney.

289
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,296
Maybe I even love you.

290
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:07,215
This is going pretty fast,
don't you think?

291
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,088
- What?
- We have a{\ really} good friendship going.

292
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:11,469
Why screw up a good thing?

293
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:12,888
Friends?

294
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:15,526
Friends.

295
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,184
My God. You just did it again.
You just Mosby'd me.

296
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,646
- I did not.
- You did. You little minx.

297
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,732
Okay, you're right.
I did just Mosby you.

298
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Why are you so afraid
of giving this a chance?

299
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,820
Because I am scared
of how much I like you.

300
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,322
This is a bad idea.

301
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,407
You're right.
This is a mistake.

302
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,792
- Yes. No.
- I love you.

303
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,660
- Let's be friends.
- Friends, then.

304
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,330
- I love you.
- Let's get married.

305
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,497
- No, you're smothering me.
- Okay, forget it.

306
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,297
You know what?
We can sort this out later.

307
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,690
- That sounds good.
- That sounds good. Let's go.

308
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,223
<i>It had been a long and crazy night,</i>

309
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,472
<i>but that morning, against all odds,</i>

310
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,099
<i>I made it to my presentation.</i>

311
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,036
Here you have it, gentlemen.

312
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,161
Rib Town.

313
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,770
Right?

314
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,455
Right?

315
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,234
Ted, listen. You're great,

316
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:10,227
and you've done a real...

317
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:12,041
special job here,

318
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,254
and you're going to make
some other restaurant

319
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:15,575
very happy someday,

320
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:16,743
but...

321
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,864
we have...

322
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:19,321
decided to go...

323
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:21,318
another direction here.

324
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,730
What?

325
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,616
Feast your eyes on...

326
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:26,878
Rib Town!

327
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,667
Sven.

328
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:37,847
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm never eating ribs again.

329
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:39,557
Yeah, right.

330
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,257
I am never...

331
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,122
eating ribs...

332
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:44,422
again!

333
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,384
In front of Ted!

334
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,484
This is a disaster.

335
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,413
How am I going
to come back from this?

336
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:55,049
Okay, I'm just going to ask this.

337
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,033
Do you really want
to come back from this?

338
00:17:57,551 --> 00:18:00,612
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Architecture is killing you, Ted,

339
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,123
and it's killing us to watch it
killing you.

340
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,298
You're like that goat
with the washcloth.

341
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:08,192
You want it so bad,

342
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:10,596
and every time the world tries
to take it away from you,

343
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,048
you keep grabbing it.

344
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,591
But you know what?

345
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,428
It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

346
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,429
Because I have to be an architect.

347
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:20,473
That's...

348
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,517
That's the plan.

349
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,770
Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.

350
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:28,557
Marshall planned on being
an environmental lawyer.

351
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:31,151
Robin planned on
being a TV reporter.

352
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:34,061
I am a TV reporter.

353
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:35,904
I'm on every morning at 4:00 a.m.

354
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,319
Is that still on?

355
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:38,825
Good for you.

356
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,632
Somebody watch it, please.

357
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,204
Barney planned on being a violinist.

358
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:45,540
Don't tell me things.

359
00:18:47,264 --> 00:18:49,768
You can't design your life
like a building.

360
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,773
It doesn't work that way.

361
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:54,799
You just have to live it,
and it will design itself.

362
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:57,052
So, what, I should just do nothing?

363
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,811
Listen to what the world
is telling you to do

364
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:02,140
and take the leap.

365
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,482
You're right.

366
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:13,702
You're absolutely right.

367
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:16,749
I love you, Lily.

368
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:19,991
Metaphorical leap.

369
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,930
Metaphorical leap!

370
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,955
- Not cool.
- Don't do it.

371
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,954
Not cool.

372
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,341
- I did it!
- Baby, you did it.

373
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,926
- I can do anything!
- Yes, you can.

374
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:40,553
I'm getting a motorcycle!

375
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,138
You absolutely are not!

376
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,224
Okay, sorry.
Guys, come on over.

377
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:23,054
<i>That was the year
I got left at the altar.</i>

378
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,981
<i>It was the year I got knocked out
by a crazy bartender.</i>

379
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,893
<i>The year I got fired.</i>

380
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,729
<i>The year I got beat up by a goat.</i>

381
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,651
<i>A girl goat, at that.</i>

382
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,609
<i>And damn it if it wasn't
the best year of my life.</i>

383
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,280
<i>Because, if any one of those things
hadn't happened,</i>

384
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,103
<i>I never would have ended up and turned
out to be the best job I ever had.</i>

385
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,829
<i>But more importantly,</i>

386
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:52,895
<i>I wouldn't have met your mother,</i>

387
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,380
<i>because, as you know...</i>

388
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:57,331
<i>she was in that class.</i>

389
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,206
<i>Of course, that story
is only just beginning.</i>
