1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,770
In the spring of 2009

1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,070
I've been hired to design

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,650
a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,010
And I was eager to add as much of my voices

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,050
as an architect into the plan as possible.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,140
woodbeams bathed in natural light in the atrium.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,280
They're gonna love it!

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,860
There was only one problem

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,250
and his name was Bilson

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,530
wood natural light

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
Ah,no!

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,110
Natural light reminds the workers that there's an outside world

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,290
where they had family and friends

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,100
We want to crash that!

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,200
You show up in the dark, you go home in the dark

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,170
You spend your whole damn day in the dark!

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,880
I need to hear Lily's voice

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
Who said you could leave

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,480
Bilson was killing every original idea I had

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,260
Then, one day

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,070
GNB took him off the project

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,220
and created a new task force to oversee my designs

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,960
suddenly, everything changed

23
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,160
We'll have a roof top in the end of the garden

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,060
for quiet contemplation

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,570
We'll have a reflecting pool in the lobby

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,190
where local children can come to make wishes.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,370
The New GNB,

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,800
A place of work

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,690
that you can call "home".

30
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,520
Thank you, and welcome home.

31
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,540
Everything was going great,

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,780
until one day, in the elevator

33
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,780
yeah, it's ted

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,450
no, no, no, no, no, no

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,710
I did not approve that change

36
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,490
for the blueprints for the new GNB headquarters

37
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,810
which I'm the head architect,

37
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,610
at only 30 years old

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,400
yes, I'm single, I'm not gifted charity.

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,010
what is that has to do with anything

40
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,180
Alright, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.

41
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,810
You know that was a fake phone call, don't you

42
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, and I also know

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,400
that the new GNB headquarters project was scrapped last month

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,300
Nice try.

45
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,920
Check out Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars.

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,570
If I could nail any celebrity

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,240
it would definitely be Scarlett Johansson

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Hot, talented,

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,830
and nobody does that many in Woody Allen's movies

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,430
without serious daddy's issues

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,940
If I could nail any celebrities, it would be Lily.

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,810
She's the star of my heart.

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,580
For me, it would be Hugh Jackman.

54
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,700
You know, I don't know, celebrities,

55
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,080
they're into some really weird sex stuff. Trust me.

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,380
How would you know that

57
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,320
This is embarassing,but I...

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,620
I went home with a celebrity one night.

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,240
Oh my god! Seriously

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,320
Yeah, he wanted to do this really freaky things with me,

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,910
So I left. That's it.

62
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,970
End of the story.

63
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,110
No, no, not end of the story

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,100
I need to know who, when, and in where. Spoil it!

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,080
Lily, be calm, please settle down.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,480
you're swallowing to much air.

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,400
But before you go any further,

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm flattered, but technically, I'm not a celebrity.

69
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,900
Plus, for the last time, I put the mask on as a joke.

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,410
OK, not you Barney.

71
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,970
OK, who is it

72
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,750
OK, now you give Lily the hiccups.

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,970
Ok, I won't tell you anything specific.

74
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,880
But all I'll say

75
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,340
is that he is Canadian born,

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,480
but you definitely know this guy.

77
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,480
And he got me back to his place

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,370
by offering to show me a very unique collection.

79
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,680
What do you mean collection

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,260
Well, you know some people collects

81
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
like stamps or coins, it's like that.

82
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,030
But I'm not telling.

83
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,170
Well, at least tell us the weird thing he wanted to do.

84
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,720
I don't know what you call it in the States,

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,270
but we have a name for it in Canada.

86
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,500
Look, I've already said too much.

87
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,380
So, mystery celebrity who collects a mystery item

88
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,290
asked you to do a mystery Canadian sex act.

89
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,040
Yes.

90
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,260
Tell us.

91
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,950
OK, I'll tell you.

92
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,250
But only if you guess all three parts correctly.

93
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,930
-Well, that's just impossible.
-Exactly.

94
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,420
I don't even know any Canadian sex acts.

95
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,800
Well, you got your Sloppy Dog Sled,

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,900
your Newfoundland Lobster Trap, your Full Mountie.

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,030
How do you know all these

98
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,030
Canadiansexacts.org, it's bookmarked on the top right.

99
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,740
-Dot org
-Yeah.

100
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,630
It's not for profit.

101
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,030
They really wanna just get the information out there.

102
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,800
Hey, so I just had the weirdest conversation.

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
This woman at GNB told me

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,780
that the new bank building was scrapped last month.

105
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,940
It's crazy, right

106
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
Wait, what's that look

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,760
-Should we tell him
-I don't wanna tell him.

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,260
-I think we should tell him.
-We're not telling him.

109
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,000
There was no look.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,740
Guys, what the hell

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,500
Ok, it's time that you know the truth.

112
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,880
A few weeks ago, Bilson called us into his office.

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
We're scrapping the plan for the new GNB headquarters.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,570
This recession is killing us.

115
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,510
We're cutting anything non-essential.

116
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,900
And I have a lot of tough choices to make

117
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
to buy courtly retreat in Saint Croix.

118
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,660
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.

119
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,920
Not when he hears it coming from his best friend.

120
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,440
-I have to tell him !
-I have to tell him !

121
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,050
You should tell him, you're his best friend.

122
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm not, you're his best friend.

123
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm not, you're his best friend.

124
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,350
Quiet, here he comes.

125
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,390
The white dude or the Asian fellow

126
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,830
See I bearly know the guy.

127
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,800
-Hey, Ted, what's up
-Hey, how're you doing

128
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm frustrated.

129
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,490
Anything innovative I put on my designs

130
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,790
Bilson just hacks out with a shitty

131
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,900
I hate to answer to a guy like that.

132
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
You should drop the project.

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,970
You should totally drop the project.

134
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,860
It's beneath you.

135
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,960
Then it's settled. To Ted Mosby's new chapter...

136
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,500
Are you kidding They just lay off another architect at my firm.

137
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,840
I mean Bilson is a pain sure.

138
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,220
But without this project, I'm probably out of the job.

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,770
Right, it's funny that you metioned the project.

140
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,250
-Because...
-You're nailing it.

141
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,620
Keep up the good work buddy.

142
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,960
Your hair and teeth look fantastic today.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,260
You're shining like a diamond!

144
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,030
Thank you.

145
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,830
I needed that.

146
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,900
All right, I'm going to head upstairs and keep working.

147
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,700
I got to find a way to introduce some wood

148
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,000
into Bilson's dark atrium.

149
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,200
I think you know what I meant.

150
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,460
-What was that
-What

151
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,860
I have a thought.

152
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
Okay, we're paying Ted's firm

153
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,500
for two more months of design work no matter what,

154
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,800
so couldn't we just let him

155
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,960
keep working and not tell him

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
He's had a rough year.

157
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,330
Let's let the guy be happy a little while longer.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,030
Marshall, what you're suggesting

159
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,430
is an elaborate,long-term lie

160
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,130
that requires tremendous commitment.

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,330
A nice guy like you can't pull that off.

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,330
Sure I can.

163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,660
Lie to me right now.

164
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,300
Okay.

165
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,500
I have a spaceship.

166
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,930
What kind of fuel powers your spaceship

167
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,030
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.

168
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,660
No!

169
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
Stand your ground!

170
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,560
If someone questions you,

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,200
distract them from the original lie with more lies.

172
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,200
Here, let me demonstrate.

173
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,330
I own a pony.

174
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,060
Ask me a question.

175
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,830
Okay.

176
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,930
Um, what color is your pony

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,100
Well, when I first got Dandelion,

178
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,100
she was a deep, chestnut brown,

179
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,230
but, sadly, her stable is located near a chemical plant,

180
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,930
which contaminated the drinking water.

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,400
So over time, she's turned a sickly, grayish-white color

182
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,530
and there's nothing that the vet can do to fix her.

183
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,030
My God!

184
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm-- That's horrible.

185
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,030
Is Dandelion going to be okay

186
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,400
Okay.

187
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,400
All right. Huh

188
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,730
You are good!

189
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,360
Dandelion's not even sick, is she

190
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,130
So the building's really dead

191
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,700
and you guys lied to me

192
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,760
We, we just did it to protect you, Ted.

193
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
I can't believe this.
I just got screwed by my two best friends

194
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,000
and I didn't even know it.

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,060
In Canada, that's called a "Sneaky Snowplow."

196
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,600
That building was my dream job, and now, it's just gone.

197
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,660
We're so sorry, Ted.

198
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,400
Yeah, I need a drink.

199
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,160
Poor Ted.

200
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
Would I seem heartless

201
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,700
if I switched us back to Canadian Sex Acts

202
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:57,660
-Not at all.
-I'm surprised you waited this long.

203
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,560
What the hell is a "Two-Hand Zamboni"

204
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,100
Let's just say, the only thing

205
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,300
the woman is wearing is skates on her hands.

206
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,330
A "Manitoba Milk Bag"

207
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,960
Okay, it's like a "Chicago Mustache,"

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
but the person on the bottom

209
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,630
is wearing a snowsuit.

210
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,430
A "Newfoundland Lobster Trap"

211
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,100
Don't know. Don't want to know.

212
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,130
Those Newfies are out of control.

213
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,530
Okay! Okay, I'm going to make my first guess.

214
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay, but I'll only tell you if you

215
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,860
correctly guess the person, the act and the collection.

216
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,960
Okay, I'm going to go.

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,830
Bryan Adams.

218
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,800
He collects baseball cards,

219
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,460
and he wanted to do a "Greasy Kayak."

220
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,900
No.

221
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,960
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,

222
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
a "Squatting Eskimo."

223
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,900
Nah-uh.

224
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,230
Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir shot glasses,

225
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,800
and a "Sticky Flapjack."

226
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,160
No.

227
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,060
That I would have done.

228
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,130
Wait.

229
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,830
Wait, if they pulled the plug on the project a month ago,

230
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,700
why have I been going in once a week

231
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,300
to meet with the New Headquarters Task Force

232
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,260
Well, obviously you couldn't come in

233
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,430
and pitch to Bilson.

234
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,530
So, we...invented the task force.

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,830
Then it was just a question of putting together the team.

236
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,930
You know Roy Waterman,Vice President of Capital and Risk

237
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,100
He's actually...

238
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,300
Roy the janitor.

239
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,930
Hey. Excuse me, Roy.

240
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
How'd you like to make a few extra bucks

241
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,660
How naked do I have to get

242
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,830
Louisa Mendoza,Executive Vice President of Assets

243
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,430
She's actually...

244
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,260
Louisa the lunch lady.

245
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,360
Louisa, I need your help with something,

246
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,300
but you can't tell anybody.

247
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,500
No hablo Ingles.

248
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,860
Exactly.

249
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,960
This is a big secret.

250
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,560
How do you say "secret" in Spanish

251
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,560
Albondigas?

252
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,500
Ah, yes. Albondigas.

253
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,630
This will be our little albondigas.

254
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,800
Hey, can I, uh,have a couple meatballs, please

255
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,630
And Arthur Nasmith,the eccentric genius guru

256
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,500
of corporate investments

257
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,960
He's actually...

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
Crazy Arty,15th Street's own one-man band.

259
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,560
Excuse me.

260
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,630
Do you have a minute to talk

261
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,400
Actually, my assistant, Reginald,

262
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,460
makes all my appointments.

263
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,230
<i>We rounded out the group with a few interns</i>

263
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,230
<i>and paied everyone 50 bucks to act</i>

264
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,430
<i>super interested in what you were saying.</i>

265
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Reginald, get me out of this for next week.

266
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,860
That was some of the most inspired design work

267
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,730
I've done in my entire career.

268
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,900
I was so excited.

269
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,200
Alex Trebek, a "Musty Goaltender",

270
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,730
-Beanie Babies!
-Nope.

271
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Damn it!

272
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,100
Wait.

273
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,030
So that explains the thing that happened with Louisa.

274
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,860
-Good job, buddy.
-Nice, nice!

275
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,130
Listen, Louisa.

276
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,860
What are we gonna to do about this?

277
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,530
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.

278
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,030
I know you feel it, too.

279
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,030
What the hell.

280
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,530
No, no puedo.

281
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,100
Me voy a casar con el senor Barney.

282
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,630
No! No!

283
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,430
No, this is wrong!

284
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,660
For God's sake,you're on the task force!

285
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,730
Is there anything else you want to tell me

286
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,560
Well, um, you know how you played

287
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,460
third base for the GNB softball team

288
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,630
There is no GNB softball team.

289
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,930
We just rented out a field,

290
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,460
rounded up a bunch of guys and told them

291
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,860
to make you the hero.

292
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,200
So my game-winning walk was a lie

293
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,700
We're sorry, Ted, but we knew that

294
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,060
you'd be out of work soon, and we just--

295
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,460
we just wanted to make you feel good.

296
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,460
You know, that's what friends do.

297
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,730
Lie to each other

298
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,230
Sometimes, yeah, to protect each other's feelings.

299
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,630
No way! You never lie to your friends.

300
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,230
I would never not be honest with you.

301
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,530
Really What about that

302
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,730
open mic night at the comedy club

303
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you like me, folks

304
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,900
Have you ever thought about how many

305
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,860
different kinds of fish there are

306
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,800
And the names of those fish.

307
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,630
Let's, uh, let's take a little ride.

308
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,060
"Trout." Am I right

309
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,760
"Sturgeon." I don't think so, pal.

310
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,200
"Salmon."

311
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,330
I'm going to say that again, salmon.

312
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,300
Who thought that was a good idea, right

313
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,560
"Bass." This guy over here knows what I'm talking about.

314
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,500
"Halibut."

315
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,200
Thank you, good night.

316
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,200
How was I

317
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,260
Oh, you were great. Really funny.

318
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,600
You killed...

319
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,760
everyone's Thursday night.

320
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,100
Time out.

321
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,930
You didn't like the fish list

322
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,000
It was horrible! You just read a list of fish.

323
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,730
Anyway...

324
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,630
you guys just proved my point, okay

325
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,460
You lied to me to protect my feelings.

326
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,830
This is completely different!

327
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,630
I just wasted a month of my life working on a dead project.

328
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,730
That's time I could've spent

329
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,230
trying to bring my firm new business.

330
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,160
Instead, I'm going to go in there tomorrow morning.

331
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,530
I'm probably going to get fired.

332
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,130
Best case scenario,

333
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,960
my boss is going to ream me out in front of everybody.

334
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,060
Back home, we call that a Sas...

335
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
"Saskatoon Totem Pole."

336
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,130
-Yes.
-It's on here.

337
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Good morning, lying bastards.

338
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,200
Anything you want to lie about

339
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,230
before I head off to work to get fired

340
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,000
- That's a nice shirt.
- You're the devil.

341
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,100
Ted, what if we told you that we found you

342
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,360
a new project at GNB where you would be

343
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,100
redesigning part of the 20th floor

344
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,660
Well, if that's a lie, it's an incredibly dull one.

345
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,060
What exactly would I be doing

346
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,060
This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.

347
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,630
Basically, Bilson wants a room just like this,

348
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,330
only two stories up, on our floor.

349
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,530
Wait, what's an E.T.R.

350
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,800
It's the Employee Transition Room.

351
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,300
-What does that mean
-Well, it's a space

352
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,460
where a supervisor and an employee

353
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
engage in a knowledge transfer

354
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,000
about an impending vocational paradigm shift.

355
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,330
People get fired in here.

356
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,600
That's horrible.

357
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,800
Why do you need a room specifically for firing people

358
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,130
Well, um, GNB feels that people need a safe,

359
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,560
secure space to deal with the news.

360
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
Yeah.

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,030
It gets pretty real in here.

362
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,630
So I reluctantly agreed to design a room

363
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,300
where people would be fired

364
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,930
But I was determined to make it my own.

365
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,900
Now, when you leave the dismissal space,

366
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,530
you'll exit into what

367
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,300
I'm calling the Rebirth Tranquility Hallway.

368
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,430
Uh-oh.

369
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,300
Here, you'll find a soothing oval chamber

370
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,300
with a trained grief counselor.

371
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,360
It's right here, past the New Beginnings Fountain.

372
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,030
Uh-oh.

373
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,230
And there you have it.

374
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,060
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,

375
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,200
a nurturing womb...

376
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,760
birthing you into a new life.

377
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,900
I love it.

378
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,600
-Really
-Yeah.

379
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,760
Nice work, Ted.

380
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Thank you.

381
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,100
Can you add some of these touches

382
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,260
to the existing 18th Floor E.T.R. as well

383
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
-Absolutely.
-Great.

384
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,660
Let's take a look.

385
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,060
Okay, so I'm thinking this wall...

386
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,060
You're fired!

387
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
What!

388
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,230
I wanted this room!

389
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,260
This exact room two floors up!

390
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,030
But...

391
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,630
You're fired!

392
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,800
Now, get the hell out of here.

393
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, honey.

394
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,560
Anyone from the band Rush,

395
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,000
a "Montreal Meatpie," and superhero lunch boxes.

396
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,460
No.

397
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,300
Okay. Rick Moranis,

398
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,300
"The Reverse Rick Moranis,"

399
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,860
antique Judaica.

400
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,830
-Nah-uh.
-I give up.

401
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,160
I've been guessing for three days.

402
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,300
I-I-I'm done.

403
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,960
If that means I never get to know,

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,800
-so be it.
-Fine.

405
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,300
Tell us!  Tell us!

406
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,660
Tell us!

407
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,230
Okay, you really want to know

408
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,600
Yes! Yes! Yes!

409
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,460
But this information

410
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,160
does not leave this table.

411
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,100
Oh, my, God.

412
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,630
I am so excited.

413
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,700
-Oh... I'm going to read it.
-Read it.

414
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,830
-I'm going to read it.
-Read it.

415
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,760
I'm going to read it. Here we go.

416
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,100
"The Frozen Snowshoe,

417
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,030
Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays."

418
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,730
Right

419
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I don't know what any of those words mean.

420
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,660
Is one of those supposed to be a celebrity

421
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,400
Yeah, who the hell is Old King Clancy

422
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,630
No, that's not the person,

423
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,830
that's the sex act.

424
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,000
It's the same as a Sacramento Turtleneck,

425
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,500
except with maple syrup.

426
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,160
So the celebrity was Harvey Straze

427
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,030
No, that's what he collected.

428
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,260
Harvey's trays.

429
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,500
Those classic orange trays you get

430
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,730
whenever you eat at Harvey's

431
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,430
The restaurant

432
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,960
Oh, come on, you're road tripping

433
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,630
down the Trans-Canada Highway,

434
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,160
you get a hunger on between Milverton and Wawa,

435
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,330
where you gonna strap on a feed bag, huh

436
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,060
Harvey's. Over 12,000 served!

437
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,630
So the celebrity was...

438
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,860
The Frozen Snowshoe.

439
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,830
Oh, my God! You guys

440
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,530
have never heard of The Frozen Snowshoe

441
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,700
He's only the most famous

442
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,100
professional wrestler in Canada.

443
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,700
I met him after he defeated Reckless Rick Rogers

444
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,260
in the Kamloops Memorial Arena back in '02.

445
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,630
Classic match.

446
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,600
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe

447
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,830
invited you back to his place

448
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,960
to look at Harvey's trays,

449
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,060
and asked you to do an Old King Clancy

450
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,530
Exactly.

451
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,630
And I'm serious, you cannot tell anyone.

452
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,160
Well, my hiccups are gone.

453
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,630
Possibly forever.

454
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,360
Canada!

455
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,060
You did it again.

456
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,830
You even found a way to ruin this.

457
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,730
Why Why do we let you be a country

458
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,460
Hey, mister mister.

459
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,930
Hey. Shouldn't you be upstairs

460
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,730
designing your big, fancy E.T.R.

461
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,200
-I'm off the project.
-What?

462
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,700
Bilson fired me.

463
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,830
You're kidding me.

464
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,300
So what does this mean for you at your firm?

465
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,630
Are you going to get laid off

466
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,600
Actually, I just quit.

467
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,600
Why

468
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,160
Because I can't work for big,

469
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,030
heartless corporate clients anymore.

470
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,300
When I was pitching to your "task force,"

471
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,400
I was doing the most inspired work of my career.

472
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,760
In a way, you idiots reminded me how much fun

473
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,630
my job can be when I'm not answering

474
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,260
to the Bilsons of the world, so...

475
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,460
I quit.

476
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,430
They fired you, didn't they

477
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,330
Yes, sir.

478
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,930
But I got a sweet severance package

479
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,460
and I've made a big decision.

480
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,630
I'm going to start my own firm.

481
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,530
Whoa, buddy. That's exciting.

482
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,800
Way to go. In this economy

483
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
So you're not mad

484
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,360
As it turns out, I'm grateful.

485
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,560
So how'd it all go down between you and Bilson

486
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,360
Well, after he proposed a vocational paradigm shift,

487
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I made an impromptu presentation using a four-pronged approach

488
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,860
that really brought him to his knees.

489
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,860
Hit him with a chair

490
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,400
-Yep.
-That's my boy.

491
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,030
And this one, I got on the drive

492
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,230
from Milverton to Wawa.

493
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,000
That's pretty impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.

494
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,030
Please, we're friends. Just call me "Shoe."

495
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,400
Have a seat.

496
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,660
So, Shoe...

497
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,200
How would you like to give me...

498
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,560
an Old King Clancy

499
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,930
I think you should go.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
