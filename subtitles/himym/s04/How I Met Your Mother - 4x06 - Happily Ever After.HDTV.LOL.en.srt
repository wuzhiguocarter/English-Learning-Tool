1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,300
Kids, the day you get married is supposed

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,100
To be the happiest day of your life,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,900
The perfect ending to a perfect love story.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,500
My wedding-- at least my first wedding--

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Didn't go so well.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,900
It's funny looking back on it now.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,900
I was so sure stella was the one.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,000
And when she left me, I was so devastated.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,200
But you guys got me through it.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,600
And now the painful part's over.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,500
I've come out the other side a little bit stronger.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,200
You know, i... I hardly even think about her anymore.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
That's what time does, I guess.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,600
It's been 24 hours.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
I know.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,000
And this is me, moving on.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
A great new chapter

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
Of my life began today,

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,700
And we're gonna celebrate.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,200
Right now, we need two things.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,400
We need kool, and we need the gang.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,300
It's jukebox time, huh?

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
I look at that young man

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,200
Popping and locking his way over to the jukebox,

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,600
And I think to myself,

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,700
You know...

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,300
Maybe stella made the right call.

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,300
Ow, pain.

30
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,900
How is he dancing right now?

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,300
He should... he should be smashing up

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,400
Stella's car with a sledgehammer.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Hypothetical.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,700
Ted isn't pretending to be happy.

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,300
Ted really is happy.

36
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
He never wanted to get married

37
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,200
In the first place.

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Ted just pulled off

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,700
The greatest train dodge since stand by me.

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,200
Well, not the first kid, but the other kids.

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,700
No, he is in bad shape.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,100
What's up?

43
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Really bad shape.

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,700
And we need to be there for him.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,700
But as much as my friend really want to be there for me,

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,600
I was...by all the appearances...

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Fine.

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,600
Hey,buddy

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,800
Want to hang out?

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
Guys, I'm fine.

51
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,700
Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,100
I'm fine.

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Hey, kiddo.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Barney, I'm fine.

55
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
This is not necessary,

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
And it's actually kind of weird.

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,700
No offense, ladies.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
I did not realize you'd be home.

59
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,900
Ladies, to the stairwell.

60
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,300
Finally, after two weeks,

61
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,300
The inevitable emotions boiled over.

62
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, you guys want to get some dinner?

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
Oh, shut up.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm sorry, sweetie.

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,600
It's just, ted,

66
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,800
You've been through something traumatic,

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
And we're trying to be there for you

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,200
As friends, but you're not letting us,

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,300
And it's pissing us off, you selfish bitch.

70
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Sorry.

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,700
Look, we're just worried

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
That you're not dealing with this whole stella thing.

73
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,600
Do you remember when lily left me?

74
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,000
You remember how I held in my feelings?

75
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,100
I... Miss... Her so much.

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.

77
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Well, I should have been even worse, okay?

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,800
I should have gotten mad.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I should have taken your advice

80
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,500
And set all of lily's stuff on fire.

81
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,600
Oh, nice-- thanks, ted.

82
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
But I didn't, and I think that that's why

83
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
It took me so long to get better.

84
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
So, now, ted...

85
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,300
I want you to explode.

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,900
Release the berserker.

87
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Okay, ready?

88
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,600
Now!

89
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm good.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,100
No.

91
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
Guys, get off his back.

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
He's happy.

93
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Listen, if ted were married right now,

94
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
He'd be married,

95
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,300
He'd be living in new jersey,

96
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,200
And he'd be married.

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,300
He's fine. Now, let's eat.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,500
How about flat michael's?

99
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,200
No, that's 44th and lex. Can't do it.

100
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Why not? It's too close to stella's gym.

101
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,100
Might run into her. Anywhere else, though.

102
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,500
Okay, um, how about hurley's?

103
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,300
Right between stella's office and her dry cleaners.

104
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,600
No, sir.

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,700
Well, what about meatloaf charlie's?

106
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,900
Two blocks from stella's mother's hairdressers.

107
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,700
Well, geez, ted, is there anywhere

108
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,800
In manhattan we can go to dinner?

109
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
Of course.

110
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,900
Check this out.

111
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,200
What you got there, ted?

112
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
A little reference map I made for myself.

113
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,500
A new york guide to places you might run into stella zinman.

114
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,300
Red areas

115
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Are places to avoid.

116
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,700
White areas are safe.

117
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,000
Blue is water.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
That is just ridiculous.

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Well, water is blue.

120
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,100
You can't live that way.

121
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,500
She leaves you at the altar,

122
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,800
And you're the one avoiding her?

123
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Yes, I'm avoiding her.

124
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
What's the big deal?

125
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,400
That's how we do it.

126
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Who's we, gutless weenies?

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,100
Uh, no, "we" is people from the great state of ohio.

128
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,600
When life gives us pain,

129
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,800
We buckeyes take that pain and we push it down.

130
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,100
And if the pain starts

131
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,900
To come up again,

132
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,200
We push more pain down on top of it.

133
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
Why confront something when you can avoid it, right?

134
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,500
All I have to do

135
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,800
Is never see stella again,

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
And I'll live a long, happy life.

137
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,800
Now, who wants to get something to eat?

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, somebody just told me

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
About a tapas place that's in the white zone.

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
Great. Let's go there.

141
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,800
You ready to order?

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,900
Uh, not quite yet.

143
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, can we get some of those almonds for the table?

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Certainly.

145
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,100
Nice call, lily.

146
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,400
This place looks great.

147
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
Who told you about it?

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,300
You know, I don't remember.

149
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
What?

150
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,100
i just remembered...

151
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,300
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

152
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
Okay, okay, just be cool.

153
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,000
We're just gonna have to deal with this.

154
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,200
Everyone... Follow my lead.

155
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Oh, you're kidding. Is he serious?

156
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,500
I am not getting under thisable.

157
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
I'd maybe get under that table.

158
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,400
She's turning around.

159
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,800
Think, think, think.

160
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,200
Everyone, just stay here.

161
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm gonna go take a look.

162
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
Marshall, go take a look.

163
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,700
And will you need utensils?

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,500
No, I'm just going straight home.

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,700
She's placing an order to go.

166
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,100
Did she seem happy? Did she say anything about me?

167
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't even care.

168
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,900
Where are those almonds?

169
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,500
Gosh, where would ted's nuts be?

170
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,400
Hey, why don't you check the vise in stella's garage.

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,100
Go yell at her.

172
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,600
Ted, you may be from ohio,

173
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200
But you live in new york now.

174
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,500
We don't push down our feelings in new york.

175
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,100
We take our feelings and we shove them

176
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,500
In somebody else's face!

177
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,900
Oh, spare me, lily.

178
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,800
You'd be doing the same thing

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
If you were in this situation.

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Thats out of rageous.

181
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,100
There is not a person on earth

182
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,900
I would hide under a table from.

183
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,300
Oh, really, not a single person?

184
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,000
Not even... Gasser?

185
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,900
How dare you mention that name to me.

186
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,080
Who's gasser?

187
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,490
He's the last person

188
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,750
I'd want to see walk through that door.

189
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,300
Michael sasser.

190
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,640
He's a guy I went to high school with.

191
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,390
Michael sat next to me in freshman biology.

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,010
He had been a bit of a loser all through middle school,

193
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,000
But the summer before ninth grade,

194
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,750
He grew 12 inches and joined the baseball team.

195
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,980
He was right on the precipice

196
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,270
Of becoming one of the cool kids.

197
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,900
Until one day...

198
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,710
Oh, lily, we've all been there.

199
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,680
When you've ripped one, it's not pretty.

200
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,990
What did you do?

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,270
Are you kidding?

202
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,010
This was ninth grade.

203
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,350
I only had one choice.

204
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,010
Oh, my god, sasser.

205
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,370
Fart much?

206
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,790
No, it wasn't me. It was her.

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, as if, sasser.

208
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,900
More like gasser.

209
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,120
Gasser!

210
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,370
Gasser! Gasser!

211
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,610
No. Gasser! Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!

212
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm on the baseball team.

213
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,180
I-i'm cool.

214
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,380
Gasser! Gasser!

215
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,290
The nickname gasser stuck.

216
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,240
He got teased so much,

217
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,510
Eventually he had to change schools.

218
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,460
Kids are awesome.

219
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,730
I've always felt awful about that.

220
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,150
But if gasser-- michael--

221
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,240
Walked in right now, as hard as it would be,

222
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,570
I would go up to gasser-- michael--

223
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,620
And I would resolve things between us.

224
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,760
Right, clear the air, as it were.

225
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,250
Oh, man.

226
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,530
Those don't come around often.

227
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,330
Y'all are welcome.

228
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,170
Hey, are you guys okay? Oh, yeah.

229
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,950
We're just gonna be eating down here if that's okay.

230
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,660
Well, here's your almonds.

231
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,690
Oh, thanks... You guys have any specials today?

232
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,810
Ted, this is ludicrous.

233
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,180
Ted, I am a person who... Well, let's just face it.

234
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,290
There are a lot of people I don't want to see--

235
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,830
People of the "chicks I banged" persuasion--

236
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,590
But if any of them were to walk in here,

237
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,830
I would stand up,

238
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,710
And I would look them right in the eye.

239
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,810
Some of them for the very first time.

240
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,320
Really, you wouldn't hide from anyone?

241
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,670
Not even, say...

242
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,170
Becca delucci?

243
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,770
You son of a bitch.

244
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,610
Who's becca delucci?

245
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,870
Do you mind?

246
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,330
So, who is becca delucci?

247
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,440
Becca is just this girl who lives upstate.

248
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,010
I used to visit her now and again.

249
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,890
Mm-hmm, where exactly upstate, barney?

250
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
Bedford hills federal penitentiary.

251
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,330
And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.

252
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,970
No way, really?

253
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,810
Really.

254
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,100
And what I had with becca was a perfect relationship.

255
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,620
She was only allowed, by law, to call me once a week.

256
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,160
If she ever got clingy,

257
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,200
The armed guards stopped her.

258
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,130
And I never had to pay for dinner.

259
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,340
Well, that's not true. I pay taxes.

260
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,690
Then again, I guess we all paid for dinner.

261
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,850
Thanks a lot, guys.

262
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,060
Anyway, the last time I visited,

263
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,190
I kind of screwed things up.

264
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,160
I know it's hard, baby,

265
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,730
But I'm in a prison, too.

266
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,810
A prison of my own heart.

267
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,450
Is that room ready yet or what?

268
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,600
Can we...? Tick-tock.

269
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,730
Barney, you're the only thing

270
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,280
That's keeping me going here.

271
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,560
That's what I'm here for, baby.

272
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm your rock.

273
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,530
I'm... Oh, my god.

274
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,230
Hello, strange.

275
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,200
Barney stinson, attorney at law.

276
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,770
Let's talk about getting you off.

277
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,320
Oh, hell, no!

278
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,820
Now I get letters from becca and she's all,

279
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,180
"i'm coming to get you the day I get out of here.

280
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,130
I'm gonna hang your eyes from my rearview mirror."

281
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,820
Women, huh?

282
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,490
See? You're scared of becca.

283
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,960
Lily's scared of gasser.

284
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,510
We're staying under the table.

285
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,830
We don't have to. Stella's gone.

286
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,470
Oh, my gosh.

287
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,580
There, all done,

288
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,650
And that's how we do it ohio style.

289
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,330
Problem showed up. We avoided it. It went away.

290
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Now we can enjoy our meal in peace and...

291
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,410
She's back.

292
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,260
Ted, we all think that you need--

293
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,940
Wait, where's barney?

294
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,050
Ted,

295
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,610
We all think that you need to go talk to her.

296
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,730
I don't. What?

297
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,210
Yeah, if t last person I wanted to see

298
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,130
Walked through the door, I wouldn't say a damn word.

299
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,770
Really?

300
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,920
And who's that? My father.

301
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,530
You guys, that other table is off the hook.

302
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,680
What are we talking about? Robin's dad.

303
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,010
I haven't spoken to him in three years

304
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,630
And I don't intend to start now.

305
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,490
Why?

306
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,050
It goes back to the day I was born.

307
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,120
You give me my son now. Push.

308
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,400
Oh, no... Oh, no.

309
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,920
He wanted a son

310
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,070
And the fact that I was a girl didn't change his plan.

311
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,980
What do you mean?

312
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,940
My full legal name is robin charles scherbatsky, jr.

313
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,900
And it only gets worse from there.

314
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,320
When I was eight, he took me hunting for the first time.

315
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,170
I don't want to shoot a deer.

316
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,650
Nonsense, r.J.

317
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,300
Shooting deer

318
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,030
Is the noblest of pursuits.

319
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,010
But they're cute.

320
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,030
You said the same thing about our rabbits.

321
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,030
Remember how delicious they were?

322
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,270
Over the years, as my body developed...

323
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,600
Whoa, hold on a sec.

324
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,250
Sorry, go on.

325
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,820
It became harder and harder for him to pretend I was a boy.

326
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,290
The lowest moment came when I turned 14.

327
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,990
My peewee hockey team had just won the squamish invitational

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,300
And everyone came back to my house to celebrate.

329
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,110
You lads availed yourself splendidly

330
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,840
Out there on the ice.

331
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,890
Splendidly. You go on outside.

332
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,750
I'll come back with an assortment

333
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,380
Of soft drinks and american pretzels.

334
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,040
I can't believe

335
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,090
You missed that last empty-netter, you hoser.

336
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,400
You're the hoser.

337
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,820
No, you're the hoser.

338
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,530
What are you doing?

339
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,530
You're teammates, hockey players.

340
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,090
Teammates don't kiss!

341
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,220
Hockey players don't kiss!

342
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,740
Oh, my god.

343
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,350
I have no son.

344
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh, you poor thing.

345
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,650
To have to grow up in canada

346
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,530
With america right there.

347
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,810
That...

348
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,970
Sucks about your dad, robin,

349
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,180
But congratulations on that game.

350
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,020
And kyle and I weren't even doing anything serious.

351
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,730
We only went to the blue line. The blue line?

352
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,610
Yeah, you know how when you're a kid,

353
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,820
You put everything into hockey terms?

354
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,100
The blue line is kissing; the red line is getting naked;

355
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,500
And I think "in the crease" speaks for itself.

356
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,790
Anyway, after that,

357
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,110
My relationship with my dad pretty much went north.

358
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,440
I moved in with my mom,

359
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,190
Grew my hair out, became a canadian pop star.

360
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,830
You know, normal teen stuff.

361
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,870
Don't you think it would feel better

362
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,490
To talk to him about all this?

363
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,000
No, that's the point.

364
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,610
It wouldn't solve anything.

365
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,330
It's in the past. It's done.

366
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,720
I mean, what would I even say to him?

367
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,730
"i wish you hadn't raised me as a boy"?

368
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,160
"i wish you hadn't taught me how to hunt

369
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,560
"and fish and smoke cigars and drink scotch

370
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,500
"because that's not what girls do.

371
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,530
"and you know the reason I throw like a girl, dad,

372
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,240
Is because I am a girl."

373
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,830
Wow, you held onto that for a long time, huh?

374
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,520
Yeah.

375
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,910
It really messed you up.

376
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,270
Yeah.

377
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,100
That sucks. I'm sorry.

378
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,360
That's hot.

379
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,670
And then I realized...

380
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,110
All of my friends were haunted,

381
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,380
But there was a difference between my ghost and theirs.

382
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,800
It wasn't too late for me.

383
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,770
I'm gonna go talk to her.

384
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,930
She's gone.

385
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm going after her.

386
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,450
Whoo. Go, go.

387
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,090
There she goes!

388
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,990
Okay, I see her.

389
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,340
She's two cabs ahead on the right.

390
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,380
Just stay with her, okay?

391
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,510
Finally. Finally, you're doing this.

392
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,830
You're going to confront her.

393
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,660
Yes, I am going to confront her. Yeah.

394
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,860
This is so exciting.

395
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,460
Totally. What are you going to say?

396
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,050
I'm gonna say, "stella, I'm sorry things didn't work out."

397
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,920
Ay, caramba. No! Yes.

398
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,920
We're going to talk about this like adults.

399
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,310
She can tell me her side and... I'm going to listen.

400
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,420
Probably

401
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,740
Should have done a little more of that before.

402
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,180
Driver, can you run us into the nearest lamppost?

403
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,370
Everyone, buckle up. Not you, ted.

404
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,530
Ted, ted,

405
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,350
You got to get mad right now.

406
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,350
Come on. Dig deep.

407
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,400
Dude, come on. This isn't about me waving my arms,

408
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,300
Stamping my feet, and getting really mad.

409
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,680
This is about stella and i

410
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,150
Finally communicating.

411
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,040
I mean, clearly, that was...

412
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,450
Stella hated star wars. She lied to you.

413
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,470
Search your feelings, ted. You know it to be true.

414
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,840
Well, that's her business.

415
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,810
Come on, ted. She left you at the altar.

416
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,090
I don't understand!

417
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,140
Ted, in the name of all that is sacred...

418
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,230
Wait, wait, wait!

419
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,270
Where is she going?

420
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,230
Her cab just missed the turn for the lincoln tunnel.

421
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,170
Why would anybody

422
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,000
Buy takeout food

423
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,320
And bring it all the way back to new jersey anyway?

424
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,800
Maybe she's going to her office.

425
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,820
No.

426
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,720
The waiter asked her, "will you need utensils?"

427
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,900
And then she said, "nah, I'm just going straight home."

428
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,330
But if she's going home, why are we still heading...?

429
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,430
Oh, my god.

430
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,830
Tony lives downtown.

431
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,810
"home" is tony's apartment.

432
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,280
She was going to make me move to new jersey

433
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,700
And then she moves into the city with tony?!

434
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,880
Son of a bitch!

435
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,930
Finally.

436
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,050
Finally, buddy.

437
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,510
I am so angry right now!

438
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,180
I know, and I love it!

439
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,750
Yeah, that is awesome!

440
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,270
Sir, we'd be happy to cover

441
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,330
The cost of that window crank.

442
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,010
I love angry ted!

443
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,340
So do i!

444
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,340
Get it out, baby. Let it out.

445
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,760
Oh... She's stopping.

446
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, it is on.

447
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,310
It is on! Yes, ted.

448
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,650
Go get her, buddy!

449
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,040
Go get rid of your demons!

450
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,320
My leg is asleep!

451
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,310
Okay, wa-wa-wait.

452
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,270
Wait, hold on. Lily,

453
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,990
What are you doing?

454
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,780
All right, hold on.

455
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,630
Look, ted,

456
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,210
It's great that you're angry right now. It sure is.

457
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,510
Yes. Yeah!

458
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,110
And that you're finally dealing

459
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,000
With this, but you only get one shot here.

460
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,490
Let's just take a beat and,

461
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,760
And think about what you're going to say.

462
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,840
Oh, I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

463
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,950
You picked the wrong guy.

464
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,650
Ted.

465
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,290
You picked the wrong guy.

466
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,710
You made a really, really, really bad choice.

467
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,070
What were you thinking?

468
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,170
That guy?

469
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,970
Are you kidding me?

470
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,880
Have you learned nothing in the last eight years?

471
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,370
You're just gonna regret this.

472
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,300
You know that, right?

473
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,970
You are going to regret this,

474
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,690
And now there is nothing you can do about it

475
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,210
Because it's too late.

476
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,760
All you can do now is go up there

477
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,160
And start your crappy, disappointing life

478
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,530
That will never be nearly as happy

479
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,230
As the one you could have had with me.

480
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,650
Good-bye.

481
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,960
Ted, wait.

482
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,110
Look, stella, I am not here to win you back.

483
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:43,900
I am here

484
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,220
Because I need to know that you know

485
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,690
You made the biggest mistake of your life.

486
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,050
I know.

487
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,550
Good.

488
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,980
That's what I'm gonna say. Oh...

489
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,610
Cold-blooded. Yeah, that's good.

490
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,930
Go say that.

491
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,650
Thanks.

492
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,230
So I got out of the cab, ready to say all of that stuff,

493
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,790
Ready to explode, but then...

494
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,640
Mommy! H-h-hey. Hey.

495
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,640
It all just went away.

496
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,800
And that was it.

497
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
In that moment, I wasn't angry anymore.

498
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,380
I could see stella was meant to be with tony.

499
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,280
Kids, you may think your only choices

500
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,810
Are to swallow your anger

501
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,430
Or throw it in someone's face.

502
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,350
there is a third option

503
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,830
You can just let it go,

504
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,530
And only when you do that is it really gone,

505
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,880
And you can move forward.

506
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,580
And that, kids, was the perfect ending to a perfect love story.

507
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,310
It just wasn't mine.

508
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,030
Mine was still out there waiting for me.
