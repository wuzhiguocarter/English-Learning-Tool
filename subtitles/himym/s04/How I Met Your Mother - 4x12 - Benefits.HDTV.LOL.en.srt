1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,310
Kids, in the winter of 2009

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,360
aunt Robin and I just become roomates.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,700
and to be honest, it wasn't going very smoothly.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,430
Ooh,that looks good.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,830
I'm gonna get some.

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,660
There's no more milk.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,630
No,I just saw some in the fridge.

8
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,760
Empty.

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,830
So throw it out.

10
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,300
The trash can's full.

11
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,030
So take the trash out.

12
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,660
I'm eating cereal.

13
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,160
You know,when I asked you to be my roommate,I figured,

14
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,430
"She's a girl,she'll be neat."

15
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,460
But no,you're Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds.

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,430
You know what,Ted?

17
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,300
Instead of coming up with hot off the press

18
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,100
topical references like that,

19
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,130
maybe you should spend a little time,

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,300
I don't know,uh, washing a dish ever.

21
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,430
Oh,darn,I can't.

22
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,630
I'm too busy leaving a plate of cookies for the magical elf

23
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,300
who changes the toilet paper roll.

24
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,230
Oh,wait,there's no elf.

25
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,100
It's always me!

26
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,530
I alwa change it. You never do!

27
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,200
-That is ridiculous! -No,I went in there yesterday...

28
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,000
I changed it,like, the last five times.

29
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,000
Stop! Stop!

30
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,930
God,what is going on?

31
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,030
When we were dating each other,

32
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,130
we were practically living together

33
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,860
and we didn't drive each other this crazy.

34
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,930
I know.

35
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,160
What happened?

36
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,260
You know what it is?

37
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,700
We were having sex.

38
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,530
Men and women need sex to live together.

39
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,400
It solves all disputes.

40
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,360
Oh,like Barney's theory about world peace?

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,700
So I explained to her.

42
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,430
I said,Madeline,every single international conflict

43
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,600
essentially boils down to sexual tension.

44
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,460
Every international conflict?

45
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,600
Every single one,dude.

46
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,860
So the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...

47
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,100
Gaza Strippers. Next.

48
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,530
Apartheid?

49
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,730
Apart thighs. What else you got?

50
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,230
Cold War?

51
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,400
"Mrs. Gorbachev, take down those pants."

52
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,830
Well,guess we should just start having sex,then.

53
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,530
Yeah,right.

54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,060
Wow.

55
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,460
I know.

56
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,460
It's like riding a bike,huh,buddy?

57
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,460
Riding a bike upside down, maybe.

58
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,200
Okay,listen. If this is gonna happen on occasion,

59
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,330
we can't tell anyone about this.

60
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,860
-Deal? Deal.

61
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,900
Deal.

62
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,950


63
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,950


64
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,550


65
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,550


66
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,050


67
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,050


68
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,050


69
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,050


70
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,050


71
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,940
Marshall,Marshall...

72
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,340
What the hell are you guys doing?

73
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,340
What,are you guys, like,back together?

74
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,170
No. We're just having sex so we don't fight ghymore.

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,470
Oh,that's a great idea.

76
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,400
No,really. Two thumbs up,guys.

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,340
Hey,I just looked into the future

78
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,700
and that works out really great for everyone.

79
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,770
What are you even doing here?

80
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,870
I was on my way to work and I just had to drop by here to...

81
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,140
read this magazine.

82
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,340
In...

83
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,270
that room over there.

84
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,970
Oh,I get it.

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,570
No problem,buddy.

86
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Uh,yes, a problem,buddy.

87
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,240
You came all the way over here to read a magazine?

88
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,970
I'm willing to bet that there is a place to read a magazine at work.

89
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,700
You know,a room with a little man on the door?

90
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,340
Okay,Robin. Come on.

91
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,770
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work.

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,000
I mean,you walk out of your office holding a magazine

93
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,940
and that magazine is saying one thing and one thing only.

94
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,870
Hey everyone,look at what Marshall's about to do!

95
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,070
Marshall's about to read a big ol' magazine

96
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,000
in the bathroom that you all share with him.

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900
Well,have you thought about maybe not reading

98
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,670
a magazine when you read a magazine?

99
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,770
You gotta read a magazine.

100
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,640
I mean, that's why there's magazines.

101
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,670
Otherwise,it's just time you're not getting back.

102
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,300
Exactly.

103
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,600
And the worst part is this:

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,240
That stretch of hallway from my door to that restroom

105
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,500
is a gauntlet of judging eyes.

106
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,870
You got my boss.

107
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,440
We all know exactly  what you're about to do.

108
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,940
Her boss.

109
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,340
Hey,Eriksen,

110
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,270
why don't you just move your desk in there?

111
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,170
I-Can't-Believe-He-Has-A-Wife Donald.

112
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh,sweetie,so obvious.

113
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,570
Anyways,I just would rather do that here.

114
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,970
No,I'm sorry.

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,340
This is our apartment now.

116
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,700
Marshall,you have to read a magazine someplace else.

117
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,700
Give me your key.

118
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,700
Yeah,I'm not gonna do that.

119
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,970
Marshall.

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,140
I seem to recall

121
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,600
a deal being struck between three parties

122
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
wherein none would discuss

123
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,470
a certain event that transpired.

124
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,670
An event of the...

125
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,900
...persuasion.

126
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,540
That key,madam, buys my silence.

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
Good day to you both.

128
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,270
You two hooked up?

129
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,970
thanks a lot,lily

130
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,570
So,wow.

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,040
You two... slept together.

132
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,670
That is awf... some.

133
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,240
Awfsome.

134
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,670
Nice work,Ted. Tap that.

135
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,000
It sounds like a bigger deal than it is.

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,340
We talked it over,and we both realized

137
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,140
we've had a rough couple of months.

138
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,040
We deserve a little fun.

139
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,170
No.

140
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,340
This could wind up ruining your friendship.

141
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,400
When two exes try to "just be casual,"

142
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,500
someone always winds up getting hurt.

143
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,200
Turned out,Lily was right.

144
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,270
But more on that later.

145
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,200
Look,guys,we've got this covered okay?

146
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,440
No one's gonna get hurt.

147
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,500
We set up ground rules.

148
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,070
Okay,rule number one:

149
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,970
This is strictly a physical relationship.

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
There are no feelings involved, okay?

151
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,740
Oh,please,that's like telling the Fonz to be cool.

152
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,500
And since it's just physical,

153
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,240
we don't have to worry about romance,right?

154
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,070
Hell,no.

155
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,440
Ooh,we can do it while we watch TV!

156
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,640
Totally!

157
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,100
And we can multi-task.

158
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,840
You know,use the sex to spice up otherwise dull activities.

159
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,100
Like folding laundry.

160
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,100
Paying bills.

161
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,800
Cooking dinner.

162
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,300
-That doesn't seem hygienic. -Yeah,not that one.

163
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,100
And now that we're hooking up, we're not fighting anymore.

164
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,300
Problem solved.

165
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,100
Actually,the credit belongs to Barney.

166
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,300
This whole idea came out of your thing about world peace.

167
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,770
Yeah. Thanks,Barney.

168
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
You were right. Peace was achieved.

169
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,540
Repeatedly.

170
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,570
So I'm-I'm responsible for...

171
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,100
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.

172
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,670
Uh... next round's on me!

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,570
Hey,are you okay?

174
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,670
Yeah. Why do you ask?

175
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Well,for one thing, you're openly weeping.

176
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,340
With joy.

177
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,440
So happy for those two.

178
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,400
Barney,admit it.

179
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,500
You still have feelings for Robin

180
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,040
and this is killing you.

181
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,340
I am totally fine.

182
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,070
Now,excuse me for just a minute.

183
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,540
I'm totally fine.

184
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,440
Barney,you have to learn how to express these feelings.

185
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,770
Maybe you should talk to a psychiatrist.

186
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,300
Please.

187
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,770
If I'm gonna pay so woman $200 an hour

188
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,640
to make me feel better, we aren't going to be talking.

189
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,100
And we're both going to be on that couch.

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,540
The woman in this scenario is a prostitute.

191
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,770
A dirty,skanky,surgically enhanced,Eastern European...

192
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,640
I got it.

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,540
And there's something kind of liberating

194
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,700
about not taking it all too seriously.

195
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,640
Yeah. Last night, we actually did it

196
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,840
while I was returning a bunch of phone calls.

197
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,100
I knew you didn't get a rowing machine!

198
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,200
Awesome, we're still talking about this!

199
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,970
Look,guys,

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,140
this is a private thing between me and Ted.

201
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,300
Private Thing.

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,900
We wouldn't even be talking about this

203
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,800
if Marshall could read a magazine at work.

204
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,500
Oh,he's always been this way.

205
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,370
Remember law school?

206
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Sure do.

207
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,570
Baby?

208
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,740
Baby,what is it?

209
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,700
The credit card bill came today.

210
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,270
You checked into a hotel two blocks from school

211
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,940
on a Tuesday.

212
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,170
It's not what you think.

213
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,940
Who is she,Marshall?

214
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,800
What's her name?

215
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,100
Burrito.

216
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,100
Carnitas Burrito.

217
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,900
So,you checked into a hotel room

218
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,470
just so you could read a magazine there?

219
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,600
Hey,Robin,do you want me to see if the waitress has

220
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,470
any giant sugar cubes for that high horse of yours?

221
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,200
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work

222
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,100
and if they say that they do, then they're not human.

223
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,600
Dude,I read a magazine at work every day.

224
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,440
I can't tell you how many meetings I've been late to

225
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,570
because I was busy "reading a magazine."

226
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,840
But I don't feel bad about it. That's my time.

227
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,770
Sure,"reading a magazine" ain't pretty,

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,970
but,you know, it's something I gotta do.

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,640
So why be ashamed about it?

230
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,940
Wait,"reading a magazine" means masturbating,right?

231
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,400
I can't believe it.

232
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,070
You drank all my milk again!

233
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,640
We can have sex.

234
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,670
Okay.

235
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,240
It's the perfect set up.

236
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,170
Anytime we start getting into an argument,

237
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,470
we just have sex instead.

238
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,370
One minute we're just laying into each other,

239
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,870
and then the next minute...

240
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,100
Well,same thing.

241
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,840
Awesome.

242
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,670
So,this morning,she's yelling at me through the door,

243
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,500
"You're taking too long in the shower!"

244
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,670
Next thing I know,

245
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,040
she hops in.

246
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Now baby don't mind I took my time.

247
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,500
So awesome.

248
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,670
Sorry I'm late.

249
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,040
I was just jammin' on Scherbatsky.

250
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,970
She used up all my stamps, so long story short,

251
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,170
the postman rang twice.

252
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,940
You must bump this!

253
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,040
That's just so...

254
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,000
Excuse me for a second.

255
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,900
So,you're saying plasmas are better for low light,

256
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,440
but LCDs are better for games?

257
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,700
Right,but the CRTs have the truest blacks.

258
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,370
So,if I want a really crisp contrast ratio...

259
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,770
The CRT's deep-pixel cell structure produces

260
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,140
a resolution you just can't match with an LCD.

261
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,770
Huh... I'll take the CRT.

262
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,600
Barney, this is nuts.

263
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

264
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,570
No,you're not.

265
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,640
You need to learn to let this stuff out.

266
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,170
Like we do in my kindergarten class

267
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,300
"Feelings Hour" every Tuesday morning.

268
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,400
Look,Lily,maybe yourindergartners

269
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,970
are upset that their friends are sleeping with each other,

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,970
but not me.

271
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,900
I have never been better.

272
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,440
Meanwhile,Marshall was still struggling at work.

273
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,400
Coming through.

274
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,070
Big breakfast this morning.

275
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
You know what that means.

276
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,940
But then came the best news  he'd heard in a long time.

277
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,340
And did you hear?

278
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,440
They laid off everybody on the eighth floor.

279
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,340
I know. It's a ghost town down there.

280
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,000
Morning.

281
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
Morning.

282
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,170
Hey,that was fun last night.

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,300
Word,that was a good one.

284
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,040
Mental note:

285
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,770
don't throw out the pizza box more often.

286
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
All right,see you later.

287
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,400
So last night,Robin left a pizza box out on the floor,

288
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,260
-so we had sex three times. -Sure.

289
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,730
And then,this morning before I left for work...

290
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,900
we kissed.

291
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,300
Ooh,that's weird.

292
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,960
That is weird.

293
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,360
Right?

294
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,130
That kiss violated the spirit

295
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,230
Of our whole arrangement.

296
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
I mean,she probably thinks I'm getting feelings for her.

297
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,760
Well,are you?

298
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
Yes,I'm in love with her.

299
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,930
Is what you--

300
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,500
That's you,dude.

301
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,460
No. It didn't mean anything.

302
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,360
It was just some leftover reflex from when we were a couple.

303
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,760
But I think I probably blew it.

304
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,960
Definitely.

305
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,730
It is so over.

306
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,800
Hold the phone.

307
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,100
Maybe Robin didn't think it was weird.

308
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,500
It was weird.

309
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,900
Weird,weird,weird, weird,weird.

310
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,930
W-I-E-R-D. Weird.

311
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,200
That's not how you spell "weird."

312
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,000
Come on,Lily. Nobody likes a Ted.

313
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,330
I tried to warn you.

314
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,730
When exes relapse, someone always gets hurt.

315
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,230
But no one listened.

316
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,530
Story of my life.

317
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,300
My cuteness interferes with people hearing my message.

318
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,800
Well,what should I do?

319
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,000
There's only one thing to do.

320
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,460
You have to stop sleeping together,please.

321
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,630
I think we have to stop sleeping together.

322
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,730
With me and Ted,

323
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,700
it's like cigarettes.

324
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,900
You have one when you're drunk and you think it's fine.

325
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,500
But before you know it, you're buying a carton a week.

326
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,400
I think I have to end it.

327
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,600
Yup.

328
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,660
I have to end it.

329
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,200
So...

330
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,960
We're ending it,huh?

331
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,530
I think so,yeah.

332
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,130
It's probably for the best.

333
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,630
It was fun,

334
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,000
but I don't want things to get weird.

335
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,830
Me neither.

336
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,660
Roomies?

337
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Roomies.

338
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,700
Robin!

339
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,060
But we tell no one.

340
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,060
Deal?

341
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,060
Deal.

342
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,600
-Deal. -Dude!

343
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,860
Come on!

344
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,160
What is the matter with you?

345
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,700
That one.

346
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,530
So,that didn't last long.

347
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,900
By the way,Marshall,

348
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,630
what were you doing back in our apartment?

349
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,700
I thought you had the perfect situation.

350
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,760
I did.

351
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,360
Everything was going great.

352
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,360
I was feeling  comfortable,

353
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,960
more confident.

354
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,630
I felt I could  take on the world.

355
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,360
One morning,I took my magazine  down to the eighth floor.

356
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,800
We gotta gut this whole place.

357
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,560
I need these walls taken out here and here.

358
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,560
You got it.

359
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,360
All right.

360
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,530
Celebrities pick up their dry cleaning?

361
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,900
I pick up my dry cleaning.

362
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,930
Don't come in!

363
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,030
So that didn't last long.

364
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,760
Oh,thanks.

365
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,360
What are you doing?

366
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,960
Oh,well,since all these roomie squabbles

367
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
are still causing friction between you and Robin,

368
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
I thought I'd help out.

369
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,230
Oh,BTW,I went by the post office today.

370
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,530
I picked you up some stamps.

371
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,760
Here's ten thousand. That oughta do ya.

372
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,160
Um,okay.

373
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,800
Thanks,I guess.

374
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,260
Hey,uh,you want a beer?

375
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,930
Okay.

376
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,660
Yeah,I picked those up on the way over. It was nothing.

377
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,860
Did you buy us a dishwasher?

378
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
No. That dishwasher's always been there.

379
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,400
How long have you been living here?

380
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
So,you are doing these things

381
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,700
to keep me and Robin from fighting,huh?

382
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,000
Exactly.

383
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,360
I worry about you two.

384
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,430
It bothers you that Robin and I a hooking up,doesn't it?

385
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,430
No.

386
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,500
Not at all.

387
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,030
That's crazy.

388
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,930
What?

389
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,500
Are you in love with Robin?

390
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,930
You're in love with Robin.

391
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,670
That's why you don't want us hooking up.

392
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,300
What? That is crazy talk.

393
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,930
Can't a bro clean another bro's apartment

394
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,700
like bros do?

395
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,130
Name me one bro in the history of bros

396
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,170
who has ever done that.

397
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,900
I'll name two:

398
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,230
Misters Clean and Belvedere.

399
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,070
Look,this thing with me and Robin,

400
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
it's totally casual.

401
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,230
I'm not gonna freak out

402
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,430
if you tell me you have feelings for her.

403
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,730
So,do you?

404
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,830
No. No,I don't.

405
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't,no.

406
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,130
I don't. I don't. No.

407
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,730
Robin is all yours,dude.

408
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,770
Have fun with her.

409
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,570
Now,if you'll excuse me,

410
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,330
I'm gonna go sleep with other girls.

411
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,530
Are you sure?

412
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,530
Yes!

413
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,730
Positive?

414
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,500
Absolutely.

415
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,670
And then I stormed out.

416
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,770
Why did I do that?

417
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,700
I mean,maybe it goes back to my father issues,but...

418
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,370
I basically gave my best friend license

419
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,330
to have sex with the girl of my dreams.

420
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,400
totally sabotaged myself.

421
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,030
And now I'm smoking.

422
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,500
Now I'm smoking.

423
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,800
Get out.

424
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,000
But it's feelings hour

425
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,130
and I'm holding Feely the Share Bear.

426
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,030
And whoever's holding Feely the Share Bear

427
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,970
gets to sit in the share chair.

428
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,830
Barney,this is not your private therapist's office.

429
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,370
These kids have issues to talk about,too,you know.

430
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,230
Ben's parents are getting divorced.

431
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,700
They are?

432
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,970
Who wants to do some coloring?

433
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,570
Oh,great,did Lily send you?

434
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,330
I don't have the bear,okay?

435
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not giving it back!

436
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,900
Why are you smiling?

437
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,030
Oh,I just...

438
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,800
read a magazine.

439
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,000
Here at work.

440
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,570
What?

441
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,330
Yeah. It's the funniest thing.

442
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,900
I was online, looking up rates for hotels

443
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,030
when I realized something.

444
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,970
This is stupid.

445
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,530
I decided it was time to let go of my hang-ups

446
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,730
and do the thing I gotta do

447
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,430
and once I made that decision, everything changed.

448
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,600
There's a young man who's comfortable  with who he is.

449
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,300
I know what you're about to do  and I respect you for it.

450
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,400
Hey,Eriksen.

451
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,730
Go the distance.

452
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,900
Marshall,

453
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,230
you made a brave step today.

454
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,700
Remember what Shakespeare wrote:

455
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,900
"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful."

456
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,530
Yoreu'ight, Super Hot Lady Who My Wife Keeps

457
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,200
Telling Me Why You're Famous But I Keep Forgetting.

458
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,200
Let's do this.

459
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,900
Lead the way.

460
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,500
Wow,Marshall.

461
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,670
Congratulations.

462
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,000
Thanks.

463
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,430
I was gonna ve to do it eventually.

464
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,730
You know,sometimes you just gotta...

465
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,130
you gotta man up and... and just go for it.

466
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,770
Marshall,I have to go.

467
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,500
Oh,by the way,

468
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,500
I have a bathroom here if you ever want to use it.

469
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,970
Son of a...

470
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,700
Ted,I have to tell you the truth.

471
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,970
I'm in love with...

472
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,330
tacos.

473
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,500
What are you doing?

474
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,430
I'm,uh,taking out the triz-ash.

475
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,970
If you're,uh,looking for Ted,he left.

476
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,600
our little arrangement is,uh,over,by the way.

477
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,770
Really? That's aws... ful.

478
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,570
Awfsful?

479
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,230
Yeah,it's just awfsful.

480
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,600
What happened?

481
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,200
Ah,he just insisted.

482
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,170
He said he couldn't do it anymore because

483
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,530
"someone's gonna get hurt."

484
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,970
think we all know who he meant by that.

485
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,730
Do we?

486
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,900
Isn't it obvious?

487
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,700
Is it?

488
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,600
Yeah.

489
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,670
It's Ted.

490
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,400
You know what a romantic he is.

491
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,130
He can't separate the physical from the emotional.

492
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,130
He'sll like...

493
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,030
I love you.

494
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,900
Exactly.

495
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,870
He's not like you,you know?

496
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,170
Besides,we're friends.

497
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,370
I don't want to screw that up by getting involved.

498
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,330
Dating friends never works out.

499
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,500
So,uh,you want to get a taco?

500
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,630
A taco?

501
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,870
You love them,remember?

502
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,630
Right.

503
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,500
Come on,I'm hungry.

504
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,170
So Robin and I went back to just being roommates

505
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,330
and things went back to normal.

506
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,400
Your Aunt Lily was right.

507
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,430
When two exes decide  to just be casual,

508
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,670
someone always gets hurt.

509
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,070
It just wasn't one of us.

510
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:15,400
