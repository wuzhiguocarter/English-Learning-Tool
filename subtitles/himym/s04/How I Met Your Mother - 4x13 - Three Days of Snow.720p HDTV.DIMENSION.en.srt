1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,900
Kids,in our sophomore year <i>of college,</i>

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,160
<i>when Aunt Lily came back</i> <i>from spring break,</i>

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,160
<i>Uncle Marshall surprised her</i> <i>at the airport.</i>

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,660
<i>And she surprised him</i>

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,630
<i>with a six-pack</i> <i>of locally brewed beer.</i>

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,500
Fort Lau-ger-Dale! Get it?

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,100
<i>And with that,</i> <i>a ritual was born.</i>

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,360
For the next 11 years,whenever either of them would fly anywhere...

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,500
Minne-Cider!

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,430
Get it?

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,030
the reunion was always commemorated with a chauffeur sign

12
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,260
<i>and a six-pack</i> <i>from wherever they'd been.</i>

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,260
Aspen Yards Ale!

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,230
Get it?

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,930
Actually, no.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,230
Me, neither. I was hoping you would.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,100
<i>But then, one night</i> <i>in January of 2009,</i>

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,100
<i>the unthinkable happened.</i>

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,100
-I'm not picking her up. -What?

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,300
Lily doesn't want me taking a cab all the way to the airport

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,460
just to take a cab all the way back, you know?

22
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,030
But the six-pack thing.

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,130
Ted... that stuff was fun when we were younger,

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,560
but we've grown past that.

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,860
As we mature, the relationship matures with us.

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,160
But... I mean, you guys are such an inspiration to the rest of us,

27
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,160
how you're so devoted and connected.

28
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,760
I look at you guys,

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,660
and that's all I want in the whole world.

30
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,730
Ted, there's two college girls outside, and they look easy!

31
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,160
So, Arizona-- you know,

32
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,500
I-I've always wanted to see

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,300
what an Arizona driver's license looks like.

34
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,000
I already ran that play, bro. They're 21.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,300
-We're good. -Thank god.

36
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,000
So, um, what brings you guys to town?

37
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,330
Our band's got a gig.

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,800
Oh, you're in a band?

39
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,560
-Hey, maybe we'll come see you play. -Excuse us for a sec.

40
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,130
Ted, what the hell is the matter with you?

41
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,130
-We're not gonna go see them play. -Why not?

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,660
If we see them play,

43
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,330
we're no better than the bleach-blonde bimbos

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,860
who flash their boobs at a Van Halen concert.

45
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,730
Yeah, but don't those girls get to have sex

46
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
with Van Halen after the show?

47
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,600
If you want to have sex with Van Halen,

48
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,060
do it on your own time, Ted.

49
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,800
We are not the maybe-we-can-come- see-you-play guys.

50
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,030
We're the other guys, the older guys

51
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,000
who never showed up and whose approval they now crave.

52
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,130
So we're their dads?

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,830
Exactly.

54
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,100
Okay.

55
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,860
It's a big meeting,

56
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,860
so I don't think we're gonna make it.

57
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,230
Maybe next time, kiddos.

58
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,400
But if you guys want to meet up after your show,

59
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,260
-maybe we could exchange numbers... -Excuse us for a minute.

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
Ted, have you gone completely insane?

61
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,600
We don't want their phone numbers.

62
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,230
Yeah. I don't know what I was doing.

63
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,630
I guess I panicked out there.

64
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,060
When you exchange numbers with a chick

65
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,830
you give them the ability to call and cancel.

66
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,060
If you set a date without a number,

67
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,530
they have to show up.

68
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,230
Check and mate!

69
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,130
The only digits I need are these.

70
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,530
Honka.

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,330
Are you still their dad?

72
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,360
So, why don't we just meet here tomorrow night around 10:00.

73
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,030
I think it's supposed to snow.

74
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,200
What do we do if there's a blizzard?

75
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,160
Either way, we'll be here.

76
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,100
"Snow" problem.

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
Excuse us just one last second.

78
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,000
What is the problem now?!

79
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,930
Nice one.

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,560
All right, we'll see you tomorrow night.

81
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,630
-Totally. -Awesome!

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
"Totally. Awesome!"

83
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,400
Man, these college chicks sound stupid.

84
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,800
-Totally. -Awesome.

85
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,600
So, here's the thing: tomorrow night,

86
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,630
dress to move; it's gonna be a mess!

87
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,630
I still think we should've gotten their numbers.

88
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,860
You always assume something is gonna go wrong.

89
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,060
Ted, I promise you, nothing is gonna go wrong.

90
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,260
Hey, it's starting to snow.

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,250


92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,250

100
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,630
<i>Kids, the blizzard of '09</i> <i>was a monster.</i>

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,660
<i>It snowed</i> <i>for three days straight,</i>

102
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,330
<i>which led to three</i> <i>amazing stories.</i>

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,800
<i>I'll start with me and Barney.</i>

104
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,060
It's pretty nasty out there.

105
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,360
I don't think they're coming.

106
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,300
Of course they're coming. They have to.

107
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,400
If I can land just one of these girls,

108
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,760
I'll have party school bingo.

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,300
come on, ted.  you're the only one here.

110
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,330
Oh. Sorry. What's party school bingo?

111
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,360
Every year, <i>Playboy</i> releases a list

112
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,660
of the top party schools in the country.

113
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,430
I take the top 25, and I make up...

114
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,360
a bingo card.

115
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,730
All I need is Arizona Tech,

116
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,160
which is crazy.

117
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,860
In league play,that would normally be designated a free space.

118
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,330
So, uh, how many people are in on this party school bingo thing?

119
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,760
Oh, it's just me.

120
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,060
So what's the point, then?

121
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,560
The point is to get five in a row.

122
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,260
And what do you get when you get five in a row?

123
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,660
I get bingo.

124
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,530
Thanks for coming by.

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,160
I monkeyed around with the thermostat

126
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,830
for about an hour before I realized it was the intercom.

127
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,830
Yeah, I heard you swearing downstairs.

128
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,060
Hey, so, uh,

129
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,500
Lily's flight's coming in tonight--

130
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,760
you're really not gonna go pick her up?

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,830
Robin, Robin, like I said,

132
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,400
as we mature, our relationship matures with us.

133
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,200
Yeah, well, if I know your wife,

134
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,530
she's gonna get you that six-pack anyway.

135
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,200
Marshall?

136
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,460
Marshall?

137
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,760
Puget Stout.

138
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,030
A most exquisite Seattle microbrew.

139
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,400
And speaking of six-packs...

140
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,460
What are you doing?

141
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm going to the airport.

142
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,700
How could I be so stupid?!

143
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,660
Of course she's bringing me a six-pack!

144
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,230
But this time, I didn't bring him a six-pack.

145
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,700
Because...

146
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,800
as we mature, the relationship matures with us.

147
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,460
Well, he sounds like a nice young man.

148
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,900
I'll bet he surprises you and picks you up anyway.

149
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,760
Oh, baby!

150
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,730
Where's my beer?

151
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,060
We said we weren't gonna.

152
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,660

153
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,230
I have beer.

154
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,700
A six-pack <i>and</i> you're an appropriate height for me.

155
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,860
Let's go, New Lily.

156
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,900
Oh, man, I got to get some beer.

157
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
Folks, this is your captain speaking.

158
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,030
Looks like we're going to be arriving an hour early.

159
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

160
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,530
Drink up, boys. I'm closing the bar.

161
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,330
Whoa, no! It's only 9:00.

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,130
And this place is ragin', yo!

163
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,000
Guys, I'm really sorry,

164
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,230
but I got to go set up cots in the church basement.

165
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,300
It doubles as a shelter on snowy nights like this.

166
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,830
You selfish bastard!

167
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,400
There are two very hot girls coming here to meet us.

168
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,360
Can't you just leave the place open a little while longer?

169
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,500
We'll keep an eye on everything.

170
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
You two? No way.

171
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,760
You wouldn't know the first thing about running a bar.

172
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,300
Serve the hotties first?

173
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,800
Here's the keys.

174
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,960
Here's the keys.

175
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,330
As soon as your girls show up,

176
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,060
you turn off the lights and you lock up.

177
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,700
I don't want to come back here and find this place trashed.

178
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,730
Wow, seriously?

179
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,260
I can trust you guys.

180
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,930
<i>To understand what it meant to us to get the keys to MacLaren's, </i>

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,400
<i>I have to take you back a few years</i>

182
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,560
<i>to the night that I uttered five little words</i>

183
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,160
<i>that every man at some point in his life will say.</i>

184
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,600
We should buy a bar.

185
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,060
Of course, we should buy a bar!

186
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,730
We should totally buy a bar.

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,260
We should totally buy a bar.

188
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,060
Our bar would be awesome.

189
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,500
And dude, dude,

190
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,560
dude, <i>dude...</i>

191
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,300
the name of our bar...

192
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,900
Puzzles.

193
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,700
People will be like,

194
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,060
"Why is it called Puzzles?"

195
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,260
That's the puzzle.

196
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,100
That is...

197
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,700
a great name for a bar!

198
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,060
And also,

199
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,730
at Puzzles: no last call.

200
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,130
No last call!

201
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
Only when every single person is finished

202
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,830
having the greatest night of his or her life

203
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,630
do we stack the chairs on the table

204
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,860
and power down the three-story margarita waterfall.

205
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,200
We should buy a bar.

206
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,730
We should buy a bar.

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,200
<i>And like the other ill-advised five-word sentences</i>

208
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,360
<i>every man eventually says</i> <i>in his life...</i>

209
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,130
I can jump that far.

210
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,260
I'm gonna win her back.

211
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,660
I can trust you guys.

212
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,500
<i>...we would come to regret it.</i>

213
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,230
<i>We just didn't know it yet.</i>

214
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,100
You have it?

215
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,060
Awesome-- I'll be right there.

216
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,600
Ranjit!

217
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,760
Hello.

218
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,760
Uh, I'm Rachel Sondheimer.

219
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,460
Wait a minute, Lily.

220
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,700
If you are getting off the plane, where is Marshall?

221
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,430
And where is your six-pack?

222
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,730
That's the problem.

223
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,360
I have to get to Brewniverse in East Meadow in an hour.

224
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,830
To the Town Car!

225
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,500
Oh, thank you.

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,800
Oh, barkeep.

227
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,930
Triple Sec.

228
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Coming right up, tap-minder.

229
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,130
We'll get one.

230
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,900
Order up.

231
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,430
We'll get one.

232
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,330
Oh, thank God you're still here.

233
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,900
I don't know if you guys have ever seen <i>Star Wars,</i>

234
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,160
-but it's like Hoth out there. -Dibs.

235
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,930
It reminds me of when I used to go sledding with my dad...

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,300
before he left.

237
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,460
And dibs.

238
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,700
So, uh, can we warm you up with a drink?

239
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,460
Sure... oh, uh, by the way,

240
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,460
I invited the rest of the band to come and meet us.

241
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,630
We were hoping to get drunk.

242
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,600
I mean <i>really</i> drunk.

243
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,330
Like my dad used to.

244
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,630
Dibsity, dibsity, dibsity.

245
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,560
Well, I guess we could keep the place open a little bit longer.

246
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,830
As long as it's just you and the band.

247
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,260
Um, Melissa,

248
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,100
what kind of band is this?

249
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,260
Oh, we're the Arizona Tech Fighting Hens Marching Band.

250
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,100
Go, Hens!

251
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,030
<i>And then, your Uncle Barney and I</i>

252
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,030
<i>had one of our telepathic conversations.</i>

253
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,130
<i>Dude, Carl's gonna kill us</i>

254
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,530
<i>if we don't kick everyone out of here right now.</i>

255
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,160
<i>Barney, I'm serious.</i>

256
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,900
<i>We promised we wouldn't mess the place up.</i>

257
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,160
<i>All right,</i> <i>I guess you have a point.</i>

258
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,230
The bar is open!

259
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,530
Who wants a beer, huh?

260
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,800
I still say this is stupid.

261
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,700
What happened to, "As we mature,

262
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,460
the relationship matures with us"?

263
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,060
That's just something Lily read in <i>Psychology Today.</i>

264
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,630
All right, she read it in <i>Cosmo.</i>

265
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,400
All right, I read it in <i>Cosmo.</i>

266
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,860
All right, it was <i>Cosmo Girl.</i>

267
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,160
Just drive, okay.

268
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,360
I just don't get why it's such a big deal

269
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,030
that one little ritual goes by the wayside.

270
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,730
It's not just this, okay?

271
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
It's all our little rituals.

272
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,460
Do you know what we used to do every day the second I got home?

273
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,900
Man, I don't want to hear about your crazy monkey sex.

274
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,360
We would tell each other what we had to eat that day.

275
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,760
Two eggs, a slice of cheese pizza

276
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,430
and some steamed veggies.

277
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,100
Everything bagel, chicken breast,

278
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
some celery sticks and a spoon of peanut butter.

279
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,060
Crazy monkey sex?

280
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,330
Crazy monkey sex.

281
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,130
Oh, Lily, TMI--

282
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,900
too many informations.

283
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,930
You know what else I miss?

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Our lunchtime phone call.

285
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,100
Hey, baby, it's lunchtime, and I love you.

286
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,660
I reciprocate in principle.

287
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,830
Although with the caveat that there seems

288
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,960
to be a bit of a surplus here on my end.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,660
No, I love you more.

290
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,600
Do we need to get in a room together

291
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,760
and bang this thing out?

292
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,930
Those sound like agreeable terms,

293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,500
although I may need adjust my briefs.

294
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,400
Love you, too.

295
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,000
But today when she called,

296
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,200
I let it go to voice mail. Voice mail!

297
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,360
How could you?!

298
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,360
The thing I miss most is kissing at midnight on New Year's Eve.

299
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,460
It was a New Year's tradition.

300
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,530
But you know what we did this year?

301
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,860
-Crazy monkey sex? -No.

302
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,000

303
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,730
-Okay, all these cute, adorable little rituals - Yeah...

304
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,060
they're stupid.

305
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,100
Telling each other what you had to eat?

306
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,400
You're like children playing house.

307
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,300
Well... maybe you just think they're stupid

308
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,400
because you've never been in a relationship

309
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,160
long enough to develop them.

310
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,160
What?!

311
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,330
You don't understand love.

312
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,760
Okay, you're like some robot

313
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,130
who sees a person crying and says...

314
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,330
"Why is that human leaking?"

315
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,330
-Is that right? -Yeah.

316
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,730
Well, then...

317
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,160
Robot initiating

318
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,730
pull-over-to-the- side-of-the-road-

319
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,030
until-jackass-apologizes- to-me sequence.

320
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,500
My robot was like, a million times better.

321
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh, hey, just so you know,

322
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,300
the trough in the bathroom is overflowing.

323
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,500
There's no trough in the bathroom.

324
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,660
And you just came out of the kitchen.

325
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,960
Ted, what's in a gin and tonic?!

326
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,130
What's in a gin and tonic?!

327
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,530
Okay, running a bar sucks.

328
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,560
Let's just close up.

329
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,800
No! No!

330
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,160
There's no last call.

331
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,960
Puzzles, go for Barney.

332
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,030
Good. You're still there. I'll be there in five.

333
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,300
Last call.

334
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,730
Robin, there's a snowplow coming.

335
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,360
We have to get back on the road.

336
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,400
You think the only way to be in love is to have pet names.

337
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,600
Or leave each other stupid, little notes

338
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,200
or go charging off into a blizzard for no good reason.

339
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,430
Seriously, do you understand what's going to happen if that plow comes by?

340
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,330
You know what you are? You're a love snob.

341
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,760
There's lots of ways to be in a relationship,

342
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,200
and you would know that

343
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,930
if you ever left your little love snob country club.

344
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,730
We're going to get buried by snow.

345
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,730
That's going to happen.

346
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,330
No, screw this.

347
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm not going to sit here and be insulted.

348
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,430
We're not going to the airport. We're going home.

349
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,730
What just happened?

350
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,160
We called earlier about the Seattle microbrew.

351
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,360
Oh, yeah, good thing you called when you did.

352
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,930
I was getting ready to close up.

353
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Storm of the century out there.

354
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,130
Of course, it's only '09, so storm of the century might be

355
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,300
a little bit premature.

356
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,460
Let's say storm of the year.

357
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,430
Although, it is only January.

358
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,700
We're in kind of a hurry, so, we'll take the beer now.

359
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,930
You are a cute couple.

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
-Thank you. -We're not a couple.

361
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,360
Thank God. That would be weird.

362
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,700
here she is.

363
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,130
"Supersonic Tonic."

364
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,430
No. This is a keg.

365
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,460
I need a six-pack.

366
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,860
A keg's all I got.

367
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,900
We'll take the keg.

368
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,060
What? Oh, no.

369
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,230
Last time I had one of these in the car,

370
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,900
I wound up chipping dried vomit off the seat with a putty knife.

371
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,330
I'm sorry, Ranjit, but this is a ritual

372
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
and I am bringing him this beer.

373
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,100
If you could just put it in the car.

374
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,660
I'll give you 50 bucks.

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,930
To the Town Car.

376
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,830
Robin, I'm sorry.

377
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,060
You're not a robot.

378
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,660
If you are, you're,like, an incredibly advanced model,

379
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,530
and the human race doesn't stand a chance.

380
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,260
You just don't choose to show your love

381
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,600
through corny rituals, and that's fine.

382
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,500
But maybe the reason Lily and I do

383
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,760
is because we always have,

384
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,030
and we don't know any other way.

385
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,030
One thing I do know is that

386
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,600
if she's there sitting at the airport alone,

387
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,430
I have to go get her.

388
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,800
Those are the rules.

389
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,760
Marshall, close your eyes.

390
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,730
I don't know how you heard any of that

391
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,230
as me hitting on you, but...

392
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,460
Just do it.

393
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,530
Now let's go get your woman.

394
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,730
All right, come on.

395
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,460
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.

396
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,000
I've always wanted to say that.

397
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,660
I mean, in a bar.

398
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,860
I say it all the time at home.

399
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,060
Dude, someday we should buy a bar.

400
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,330
And what we would do,

401
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,360
we are <i>never</i> going to have last call.

402
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,800
Come on, Barney.

403
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,700
We said no last call.

404
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,860
We've got to mean it.

405
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,730
Well, what are we supposed to do?

406
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,060
Carl's going to be here any minute.

407
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,360
Only one thing we can do.

408
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,900
Dude, running a bar is a pain in the ass.

409
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,560
We should just stick with what we know.

410
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,130
We should start a band.

411
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,560
Of course we should start a band!

412
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,900
How have we not started a band yet?

413
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,430
<i>Kids, sometimes in life</i><i>the planets align,</i>

414
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,730
<i>everything links up,</i>

415
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,560
<i>and your timing is perfect.</i>

416
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,060
Marshall?

417
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,800
Lily?!

418
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,230
Marshall?

419
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,260
Lily?

420
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,030
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>

421
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,400
Where is she?

422
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,660
Seattle.

423
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,200
-What? -Her flight's canceled.

424
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,100
It never took off.

425
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
No, no, she would've called me and...

426
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,760
Hey, baby, it's me.

427
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,600
My flight's been canceled because of some snowstorm

428
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,160
and they couldn't rebook me till Thursday,

429
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,930
so I'm stuck here for another two days.

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,460
But it's lunchtime, and I love you.

431
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,360
<i>Like I said,</i> <i>this was a three-day storm.</i>

432
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,320

433
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,330
I still say this is stupid.

434
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,630

435
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,400

436
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,400
Seattle microbrew.

437
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,700
<i>So on Tuesday when Marshall</i> <i>heard that message...</i>

438
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,830
She's not coming in till Thursday.

439
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,100
I mean, we came all the way down here,

440
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,660
and she's not coming in till Thursday.

441
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,730
I feel so stupid.

442
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,460
Look, let's just,let's not tell Ly about any of this, okay?

443
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,830
Especially the part about you hitting on me.

444
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,030
I didn't hit on you.

445
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
Exactly.

446
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,800
Then on Wednesday...

447
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,300
Oh, man.I can't believe you drove all the way out there.

448
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,660
Now you're just going to turn around

449
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,230
and drive all the way out there again tomorrow.

450
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,460
Yeah, no. Um, this whole thing was a sign, you know?

451
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,260
It's time to put that old ritual to bed.

452
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm not going to pick her up.

453
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,500
Robin really hit on you?

454
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,360
Dude, it was weird.

455
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,700
Bros, this party is <i>awesome!</i>

456
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,960
You are true friends of the Fighting Hens.

457
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,100
If you ever need anything,don't hesitate to ask.

458
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,830
Is the flute section seeing anyone?

459
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,730
So, wait, you're really not going to pick her up?

460
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,730
Yeah, really.

461
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,430
So the New Year's kiss,

462
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,430
the lunchtime phone calls,

463
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,230
the whole "this is what I ate today" thing,

464
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,760
you're, you're really letting it all go?

465
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,730
I really am.

466
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
<i>Which brings us to Thursday.</i>

467
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260

468
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,300
A muffin, a pastrami sandwich, and a bag of chips.

469
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,400
And I know it's way past lunchtime, but I love you.

470
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,560
More and more each day,

471
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,960
I love you, Lily.

472
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,600
Happy New Year.

473
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,460
Um, wait, does this mean that I have

474
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,360
to bring a marching band to the airport from now on?

475
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,200
-Absolutely, it does. -Crap.

476
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,460
Puzzles.

477
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,460
That is a great band name.

478
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
Hey, have you seen Amanda?

479
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,960
Bingo!
