1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,839
Hey, guys. Hey.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,669
It's freezing out there. Where's your coat?

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,959
Ted, I'm canadian. I don't need a coat.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,499
This kind of weather is nothing for me.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,809
Yeah. This is like a spring day back in minnesota,

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,939
If it weren't for all the taxis

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,290
And the skyscrapers and non-white people.

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,939
There aren't any black people in minnesota?

9
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,450
Not if prince is on tour.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,069
Well, my sister's plane got in an hour ago,

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,839
Or as a meteorologist might say,

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,369
Hurricane heather has just made landfall.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,219
Come on. She's not that bad.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,359
Here's the back of heather's baseball card.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,439
It took her six years

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,039
To graduate from three different colleges,

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,079
During which time she wrecked two cars,

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,829
Got married for five days,

19
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,579
And lived in a tree for nine weeks,

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,519
Only to realize that no one had any intention

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,830
Of cutting it down.

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,539
And now, heather says

23
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,779
She's moving to new york.

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,519
Wow, that's big news.

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,709
She's never gonna go through with it.

26
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,639
Remember a few years back when she talked about transferring

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,269
To nyu? And then,

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,539
On the day of the admissions interview...

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,649
Heather?

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,670
Where's my couch and my tv?

31
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,409
I sold them

32
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,180
For nine inch nails tickets.

33
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,509
The tv alone is worth two grand.

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,080
Well, a last-minute plane ticket is expensive.

35
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,819
Wait. Where are you?

36
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,800
Somewhere in spain.

37
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,250
Oh! Gotta go. Slow song.

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,270
Oh, crap.

39
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,299
It's barney.

40
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,069
So?

41
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,629
For all the years heather's been visiting new york,

42
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,389
Ted's never let barney meet her.

43
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,689
And I never will.

44
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,170
Every year when the mosby family christmas card shows up...

45
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,189
Pulling down her pants

46
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,329
Yanking off my own

47
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,569
Underneath the mistletoe

48
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,289
I'll make your sister moan

49
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,359
Oh! Heather's hot, Heather's hot

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,979
And we'll go all the way...

51
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,409
I wish I could see her naked

52
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,349
I wish I could see her naked

53
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,569
I wish I could see her naked

54
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,230
And down on all fours.

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,779
Ted has a little sister

56
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,349
Gets hotter every day

57
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,339
And if I ever meet her with her boobies I will play!

58
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,100
Everybody! Sister, sister, sister!

59
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,770
What? I can celebrate hanukkah, too.

60
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,669
Oh, it's him again.

61
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,160
I should probably get it.

62
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,239
Hey, barney.

63
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,909
Hey. What's on tap for tonight?

64
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,729
Oh, we're heading over to marshall and lily's

65
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,299
For a kathy bates movie marathon,

66
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,369
But not misery.

67
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,540
You wanna join us...?

68
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,930
Oh. He hung up.

69
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,419
Hey. Oh, it's great to see you.

70
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,259
Hey, kiddo. You look great.

71
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,539
How are things back home?

72
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,639
Well, I moved into your old room.

73
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,709
Did you know that you can see

74
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,209
Strange mrs. Gottwald's bedroom across the street?

75
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,299
Oh, yes.

76
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,809
I am aware of that.

77
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,819
How's she looking?

78
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,169
Ted, she's 62.

79
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,750
Answer the question.

80
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,530
Surprisingly perky.

81
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,419
Man, it is cold out there.

82
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,730
Why, hello.

83
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,200
I've been waiting for you.

84
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,509
Wait a second. That's not our chair.

85
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,759
Did you bring that chair yourself?

86
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,580
I needed one that swivels.

87
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,240
Heather mosby...

88
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,080
Barney. Stinson.

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,740
Um... How did you even know heather was coming into town?

90
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,479
Never tell me anything!

91
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,229
You know I can't keep secrets around christmas!

92
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,320
Robin's giving you an ipod!

93
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,649
Ted, can I chat with you

94
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,270
For a sec in the kitchen?

95
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,580
No one touch the chair. It's a rental.

96
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,589
I can't believe you've been

97
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,789
Hiding your sister from me all these years.

98
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,959
Do you blame me?

99
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,429
You're like weird al yankovic

100
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,980
If he only wrote christmas songs about banging my sister.

101
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,990
Okay. First of all, I'm flattered.

102
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,559
Secondly, they're just jokes.

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,779
A bro can joke about another bro's sister.

104
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,029
It doesn't mean I'm ever gonna act on it.

105
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,139
Look, I love my sister, and as her older brother,

106
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,000
It's my job to protect her from guys like you.

107
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,419
You don't trust me, do you?

108
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,419
No. And I don't trust her either.

109
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,280
Fine. Great.

110
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,930
I guess I'll just... Take my chair and go.

111
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,450
Wait... Stop... Come back...

112
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,100
Lily and I are taking heather out for dinner on sunday.

113
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,199
Do you wanna come?

114
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,030
I already called hurley's and added a fourth.

115
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,579
You really can't tell lily anything.

116
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,260
No, you can't tell her... Jeez.

117
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,779
That year, the holidays

118
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,869
Were really making aunt robin miss canada,

119
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,619
So marshall brought her to the spot he went

120
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,809
Whenever he got homesick

121
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,469
The walleye saloon.

122
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,599
Evening, everybody.

123
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,419
Marshall!

124
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,239
Meet robin.

125
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,529
Robin!

126
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,669
Go back to drinking.

127
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,719
Drinking!

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,719
What's up, marshall?

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,289
Hey, what's u...? Whoa! Bud!

130
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,939
What's with the hitch in your giddyap?

131
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,609
Oh, I was playing some hockey today.

132
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,819
Tore up something in my knee.

133
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,959
Did you go to the hospital?

134
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,369
Nah. I just poured some beer on it.

135
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,759
Can't miss the vikes game.

136
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,579
Twin cities!

137
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,070
Oh, yeah!

138
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,529
I love the guys here.

139
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,529
They're real men.

140
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,499
No hair products or manicures.

141
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,059
All new york guys are like 10% girl.

142
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,169
Come on. That seems a little unfair.

143
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,649
I'll have the vichyssoise

144
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,779
With just a soupon of crme frache.

145
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,870
Too much dairy and I tend to bloat.

146
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,390
So... I found an apartment today.

147
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,989
Really? Yeah.

148
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,429
And I was hoping you'd have

149
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,529
A little more wine in you before I asked you this, but...

150
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,950
I need you to co-sign the lease.

151
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,810
Let me think about it.

152
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,259
That means he's not going to do it.

153
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,619
I could really use your help on this.

154
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,790
Let's talk about this later, okay?

155
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't hold your breath.

156
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,450
What is it?

157
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,379
You don't trust me?

158
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,890
You're my sister.

159
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,779
Now he's just stating a fact.

160
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,889
Look, ted, I am serious about a career in finance, but...

161
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,919
You just keep looking at me like I'm a four-year-old

162
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,669
Who says she wants to be an astronaut.

163
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,349
I just don't think you have any idea

164
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,999
How tough it is to make it in new york.

165
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,469
Exactly. You need connections.

166
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,009
If only ted knew someone who worked at, say...

167
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,729
Goliath national bank,

168
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,250
Then... Wait.

169
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,920
What?

170
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,039
I work at goliath national bank.

171
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,590
How 'bout that?

172
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,489
All right.

173
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,329
We got two bemidji pale ales

174
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,219
And... Who ordered the mini-burgers?

175
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,460
Me.

176
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,559
Is that fisherman's quest? Mm-hmm.

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,819
I used to play fq all the time back home!

178
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,709
Oh, yeah? I kinda have high score.

179
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,019
Not to brag, but

180
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,909
I caught... Oh...

181
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,140
A 35-inch northern pike.

182
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,830
The biggest video fish anyone's ever reeled in.

183
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,450
I mean... Freshwater.

184
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,200
A tip of the angler's cap, my friend.

185
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,260
Thank you for bringing me here.

186
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,980
Uh! Those are mine.

187
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,599
This is not a good idea.

188
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,489
Heather and barney alone in his office?

189
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,649
And I certainly don't want to be on the hook for her lease.

190
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,759
She is growing up. You just can't see it yet.

191
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,449
We're talking about a girl who was busted for shoplifting

192
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,909
Eight months ago.

193
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,359
Ted, a lot of women

194
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,409
Go through a shoplifting phase.

195
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,359
And sure, maybe to this day, they swipe

196
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,989
The occasional smaller item because it turns them on

197
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,610
In a weird way that they can't quite explain.

198
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,229
But...

199
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,909
If it'll make you feel better,

200
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,109
I-i'll tag along to gnb tomorrow.

201
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,919
I'll say I'm having lunch with marshall,

202
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,179
But actually, I'll be spying on her and barney.

203
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,450
Okay.

204
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,220
Okay, I'm good with that.

205
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,039
Heather! Heather...

206
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,759
Good luck tomorrow at gnb. I'm sure

207
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,210
You'll knock 'em dead. And I'll be spying on you guys.

208
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,610
Damn it!

209
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,259
"i'm drinking till I forget the 1999 nfc championship"?

210
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,550
That game.

211
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,489
The vikings

212
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,449
Were two minutes away from going to the super bowl,

213
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,469
When our kicker, who hadn't missed all year

214
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,329
Shanked a field goal, and we lost in overtime.

215
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,520
Damn!

216
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,469
'99 nfc championship game?

217
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,170
Yeah. Damn!

218
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,929
My dad, who I'd never seen cry my whole life,

219
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,450
Wiped away a tear.

220
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,180
He said...

221
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,940
"a little part of me just died, son."

222
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,739
I love how intense you guys are about your vikings.

223
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,050
It's like when we watch hockey night in canada...

224
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,549
What?

225
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,319
Don't let anyone in here know

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,409
That you're not from minnesota.

227
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,290
Why? What are they gonna do if they find out I'm from...

228
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,499
Does this look like a dallas bar to you, pal?

229
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,029
It's weird, but there's something comforting

230
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,990
About being carried like this.

231
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,939
See you later, buddy!

232
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,280
Man, can you believe that guy?

233
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,540
So, robin, where are you from?

234
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,220
Bemidji.

235
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,969
Bemidji, minnesota.

236
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,430
Go, vikes!

237
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,859
Kids, for what happened next,

238
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm gonna jump ahead a couple days.

239
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,349
That is a pretty sweet briefcase. Mmm...

240
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,929
That's a pretty sweet security camera, too.

241
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,369
Oh! And there's another one.

242
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,429
And a guard.

243
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,549
I'm planning on paying for it, ted. Yeah.

244
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,590
Well, you don't have the job yet.

245
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,090
That door's a push, not a pull.

246
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,420
There you go.

247
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,829
Hey, thanks again for keeping an eye on her yesterday.

248
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,269
Look, maybe I was wrong.

249
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,839
She sounds like she handled barney just fine.

250
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,469
Maybe she'll be able to handle new york.

251
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,840
No thanks necessary! Heh!

252
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,439
Why not?

253
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,119
I have a secret.

254
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,859
No, I don't! Nothing happened.

255
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,150
Something happened.

256
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,800
What happened?

257
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,659
Nothing.

258
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,959
After heather's interview,

259
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,529
I went to say hi to marshall for a few minutes,

260
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,410
And when I came back...

261
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,929
Oh, my god!

262
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,819
Lily, lily, before you say or do anything,

263
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,069
I beg you one favor.

264
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,969
What?

265
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,800
Get off that. It's prada.

266
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,049
I am so sorry.

267
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,919
I knew it.

268
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,789
I knew it all along.

269
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,799
She is still the same, irresponsible train wreck

270
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,799
That she always was, and when I see barney...

271
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,319
You won't say a word.

272
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,869
Ted, heather begged me not to tell you.

273
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,950
She will hate my guts if she knows that I blabbed.

274
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,709
Oh, I love that briefcase, but I can't afford it.

275
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,390
You were right, ted.

276
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,749
I certainly was.

277
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,849
See?

278
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,529
She didn't get the briefcase!

279
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,199
That's responsible!

280
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,689
And there's almost no way she had sex with anyone in there.

281
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,110
Turning over a new leaf.

282
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,059
Evening, everybody!

283
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,199
So my dad and I are at the '99 nfc championship game.

284
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,169
I say evening, everybody!

285
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,319
And when we missed that field goal and lost...

286
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,740
Damn!

287
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,760
Damn! Damn.

288
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,480
...My dad, who I had never seen cry in my entire life,

289
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,290
Wiped away a tear and said,

290
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,710
"a little part of me just died, son."

291
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,010
"son"?

292
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,870
I told it the way I'm gonna tell my son.

293
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,659
If I'm ever lucky enough to have a son,

294
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,870
And name him rashad tarkenton.

295
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,749
Robin,

296
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,589
Great story.

297
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,720
Great story!

298
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,959
But it does sound a little bit familiar.

299
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,889
I know!

300
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,499
They totally ate it up.

301
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,009
I see what you're doing here.

302
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,779
What?

303
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,169
I brought you here as a favor

304
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,529
Because... Because I felt sorry for you, okay?

305
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,800
And now it's like you're trying to steal my bar.

306
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,709
You think I'm trying to steal your bar?

307
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,329
Oh, get oot.

308
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,779
"get oot"? What, are you canadian?

309
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,799
No, i...

310
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,559
You want to impersonate a canadian,

311
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,940
Just turn of the lights and get all scared!

312
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,529
What was that?

313
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,669
Oh, well, with canada right across the border,

314
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,469
We minnesotans sometimes like to make jokes

315
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,319
At your guys' expense

316
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,889
And they're all sort of along the same theme.

317
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,589
That we're afraid of the dark?

318
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,409
Yeah, For example.

319
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,119
Uh, hey, everyone, how many canadians does it take

320
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,140
To change a lightbulb?

321
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,390
"what? Oh, no, the lightbulb's out?! I'm scared!"

322
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,529
That is insane.

323
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,949
Why do you think the canadians are afraid of the dark?

324
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,859
Well, where does any prejudice come from, robin?

325
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,809
A stereotype starts,

326
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,459
And all of a sudden it spreads like wildfire.

327
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,379
Like asians can't drive, scotsmen are cheap,

328
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,710
Brazilians always put on way too much postage.

329
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,229
I just don't think this is gonna work out, robin.

330
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,209
You can't be hanging out with people who belittle

331
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,550
Your beloved homeland, so I'll walk you out.

332
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,560
No, wait, I have something to say.

333
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,360
Hey, everybody.

334
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,819
Let me tell you something about people from canada.

335
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,460
Hey, robin, please don't make a scene. Shh!

336
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,770
Do you know why canadians never get a birthday wish?

337
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,640
Because they're too afraid to blow out the candles.

338
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,860
Oh, god, I love it here. God.

339
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,139
I think your prospects at gnb are good.

340
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,369
You certainly made it clear

341
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,939
You're will to take any position.

342
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,639
Are these new coasters?

343
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,479
Well, I hope you get the job.

344
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,059
Nothing gives me more pleasure

345
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,899
Than filling an opening.

346
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,239
I swear to god these coasters are thicker.

347
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,409
Well, I am willing to bend over backwards.

348
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,969
Okay, that's it!

349
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,630
I cannot believe you had sex with my sister!

350
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,609
You blabbed?!

351
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,669
Do you know what?

352
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,859
This is a new batch of the old coasters.

353
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,899
I'm just gonna confirm that with the bartender.

354
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,299
And you, you're mature and responsible now?

355
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,809
Is it mature and responsible

356
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,949
To go to your first big job interview in new york city

357
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,919
And nail a total stranger?

358
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,679
You've always been immature and irresponsible.

359
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,929
You will always be immature and irresponsible.

360
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,909
And I wouldn't cosign a library card for you,

361
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,679
Let alone a lease.

362
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,179
Barney and I didn't have sex.

363
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,549
Save it. Lily saw you.

364
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,249
Or did she?

365
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,119
You see, ted, you had so little faith in heather and me...

366
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,229
...We decided to give you

367
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,069
Exactly what you expected of us.

368
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,399
And I knew we could count on lily to blab.

369
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,719
What? Why would you do that?

370
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,989
Because you deserved it.

371
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,339
Ted, you know I'm no saint.

372
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,999
And yes, it's true that time I drove

373
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,749
Your mother to the airport,

374
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,079
Well, let's just say there was a very confusing,

375
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,550
Sexually charged moment in short-term parking,

376
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,029
But I said I would never go near your sister,

377
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,339
And I meant it.

378
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,579
You should have trusted me.

379
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,429
You're so convinced I'm still

380
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,179
Some out-of-control teenager,

381
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,150
You missed the fact I grew up.

382
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,649
I'm gonna find a hotel.

383
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,400
I'll get my things later.

384
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,580
Merry christmas.

385
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,400
Your mom and I kissed.

386
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,569
Better get a move on.

387
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,619
You got five seconds to catch two more sturgeon.

388
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,389
Hey, we got a possible gill screen.

389
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,119
Forget it.

390
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,399
You can't catch two fish with one hook.

391
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,919
No, but I can catch one fish

392
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,720
And use that fish to catch the other one.

393
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,399
High score! You beat marshall!

394
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,929
She's canadian!

395
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,440
Robin's canadian!

396
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,949
She's canadian.

397
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,199
She's not from bemidji

398
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,899
And she doesn't know a darn thing about the vikings.

399
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,910
You're just mad 'cause she got high score.

400
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,419
Robin,

401
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,989
In the '99 nfc championship game when the vikings lost...

402
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,899
Damn!

403
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,130
Oh, damn!

404
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,080
...Who was the kicker who missed the field goal?

405
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,780
Rashad tarkenton.

406
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,890
Gary anderson.

407
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,339
He's now retired.

408
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,390
Owns a fly-fishing business...

409
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,000
In canada.

410
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,040
Good-bye, robin.

411
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,270
No.

412
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,630
You know what?

413
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,010
I'm glad you found oot

414
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,989
Because I'm proud to be canadian.

415
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,890
We may not have a fancy nfl team or prince,

416
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,619
But we invented trivial pursuit.

417
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,240
You're welcome, earth!

418
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,369
Plus in canada, you can go to an all-nude strip club

419
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,510
And order alcohol.

420
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,579
That's right.

421
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,709
From moosejaw to the bay of fundy,

422
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,189
You can suck down a 20-ounce pilsner

423
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,129
While watching some coal miner's daughter strip down to her pelt.

424
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,370
Jealous?!

425
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,740
In canada people don't care where you're from,

426
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,729
As long as you're friendly and maybe loan them a smoke

427
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,070
Or hand over a donut.

428
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,310
I'm proud to be from the great white north...

429
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,070
And I wish I was there right now.

430
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,290
And we're not afraid of the dark.

431
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,670
I mean, we don't love it, but who does?

432
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,390
Merry christmas.

433
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,350
Ted...

434
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,910
Look inside.

435
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,939
You just, if you push it towards the...

436
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,339
Not down, towards the middle.

437
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,770
Don't need your help. Got it.

438
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,949
You signed the lease.

439
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,430
Yeah. You know why?

440
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,159
Because you trust me and think it's a great idea?

441
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,689
Because I want to get to know you.

442
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,110
The new you.

443
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,460
Thanks.

444
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,569
By the way,

445
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,579
In your new neighborhood,

446
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,680
You really should get a good solid deadbolt for the door.

447
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,270
If you want...

448
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,600
To live.

449
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,219
I'm so sorry for what happened back there.

450
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,289
I-i acted like a total jerk.

451
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,619
I, I shouldn't have said anything.

452
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,209
No, look, I'm sorry. That was your place.

453
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,250
I shouldn't have tried to make it mine.

454
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,420
Just every year at the holidays, I get homesick.

455
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,189
And so far, every year

456
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,950
A boyfriend, a job, or something.

457
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,470
But this year for the first time, I don't.

458
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,640
Yes, you do.

459
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,990
What?

460
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,280
We all love you, okay?

461
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,339
If you ever moved back to canada,

462
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,359
We would hop on a plane, we would track you down,

463
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,319
And after barney dragged us

464
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,460
To a few of those strip clubs you talked about,

465
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,789
We would bring you back right here

466
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,109
Where you're supposed to be.

467
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,960
It's... It's not new york without robin scherbatsky.

468
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
Thanks.

469
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,610
I just miss it there sometimes.

470
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,479
I wish I could blink my eyes

471
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,290
And be back in canada for an hour, you know?

472
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,700
I was hoping you would say that.

473
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,689
How did you find this place?

474
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,739
Feels like home, right?

475
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,330
There's one way to find out.

476
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,299
Well, sorry there. Didn't see ya. Are you okay?

477
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,309
I'm fine.

478
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,670
Okay, sorry aboot that.

479
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,839
Have a donut on the hoose.

480
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,730
Thanks. Okay.

481
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,679
Okay, you bumped into him,

482
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,839
And he apologized and gave you a donut on the hoose?

483
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,740
Oh, it's just like home.

484
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,179
Sorry!

485
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,130
It's gonna be fine! Sorry.

486
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,560
No one likes the dark.

487
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,089
Next up from Ontario

488
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,269
Marshall erickson.

489
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,179
I didn't know you signed up. What are you gonna sing?

490
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,799
Oh, I think you'll recognize it.

491
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,989
Buddy, you can turn off the screen. We know the lyrics.
